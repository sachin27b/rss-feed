The 'Schitt's Creek' star, currently touring India, was presented with a personalized RR jersey by head coach Rahul Dravid. Even though the Rajasthan Royals haven't had the best of campaigns this IPL, the Rahul Dravid led side are making the most of the window before the season enters its final stretch. Given the fact that RR is rooted to 9th spot and have just six points to show, RR's hopes of making it to the playoffs are near zero. However, an unexpected crossover ahead of the game against Punjab Kings on Sunday made for a light-hearted interaction between head coach Dravid and Canadian actor-comedian Eugene Levy. \"Schitt just got real! Eugene Levy is a Royal.\", posted RR on Instagram under a clip showing the actor and Dravid in conversation, as the former presents Levy with a customized RR kit that reads 'Levy'. The actor delightedly received the gift as he vowed to support the royals. He also claimed that RR is the first-ever cricket team that he'll be supporting. \"Now that you're a Rajasthan Royals fan, we've got a special gift for you.\" Dravid added, \"Hopefully you'll wear it with pride watching out games.\" Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!With a wide smile on his face, Levy replied, \"Well, there it is. I\u2019m a Royals fan. My first cricket team, and it will always be my first cricket team.\" The 78-year-old took the time to turn up at RR's training ground during his tour in the country."

But he also never downplays what she meant to him. \u201cEvery little thing she said or did, and how she looked at me when she first met me... her whole life comes alive in front of my eyes,\u201d he once said to Reddif.com.\"Thoughout the journey from home to hospital, she kept apologising and I told her that everything would be okay. She looked at me with tears in her eyes. Her look said it all. The doctor came out after an hour and said she had gone into a coma. I was part of her and she was part of me. It is natural that you miss a person who was your heart and soul throughout your life, no matter how brave you may say you are. She and her memories will continue to be part of me till my last day,\" he added.Smita Patil\u2019s story isn\u2019t one of fairytale romance or tidy endings. It\u2019s the story of a woman who loved fiercely, fully aware of the price she might pay. She embraced contradictions, defied convention, and lived\u2014and died\u2014by her own rules. Her legacy endures, not just through the powerful roles she portrayed, but in the memory of a love that refused to conform to society\u2019s expectations.Years after Smita's demise, her professional rivalry Shabana Azmi is set to work with her son Prateik Babbar in a film titled, 'Imaginary Rain', directed by chef-author Vikas Khanna. Based on Khanna\u2019s novel, the film follows a masterchef in Manhattan (played by Azmi) who returns to India after a personal tragedy. The collaboration holds emotional depth, as Azmi was once a professional rival of Prateik\u2019s late mother, Smita Patil. Azmi described working with Prateik as \u201cdestiny\u201d and noted his striking resemblance to Smita. Prateik recently revealed Azmi and Javed Akhtar had once considered adopting him, adding poignancy to their onscreen bond. The film explores identity, legacy, and generational connections."

An Israeli air strike on the European Hospital in Gaza's Khan Younis has killed over 40 people and injured dozens more, according to officials from the Hamas-run civil defence agency.At least 22 children were killed and 48 others reportedly lost their lives, according to the Indonesian Hospital in Jabaliya. The strikes occurred a day after Hamas released an Israeli-American hostage in a deal brokered by the United States, coinciding with a visit by US President Donald Trump to Saudi Arabia.Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu announced there was \u201cno way\u201d Israel would halt its war in Gaza, dampening hopes for a ceasefire.The Israeli military refused to comment on the strikes but had earlier warned residents of Jabaliya to evacuate late Tuesday night, citing the presence of Hamas infrastructure in the area, including rocket launchers.Netanyahu's office said Israeli forces were just days away from a promised escalation of force and would enter Gaza \u201cwith great strength to complete the mission. ... It means destroying Hamas.\u201dLocal sources quoted by BBC say that six bombs were dropped simultaneously by Israeli warplanes, striking both the inner courtyard of the hospital and its surrounding areas. The attack left several deep craters across the hospital compound, burying vehicles, including part of a large bus, under rubble."

They will not only pay less tax but also be free from the maze of deductions and exemptions. Taxpayers who made the mistake of buying life insurance only to save tax now have an opportunity to redeem themselves. Life insurance is the lynchpin of a financial plan and a well-chosen policy safeguards all financial goals of an individual. But traditional life insurance policies offer very low coverage of just 10 times the annual premium. They are mostly bought for saving tax, not financial protection.With no deduction available under the new regime, policyholders will not find them very useful. However, closing a policy prematurely has financial implications.Total loss for new purchases: Did you buy life insurance in the past two years? If a life insurance policy has not completed three years, all the premiums paid will be forfeited if the policy is prematurely closed. To many people, this may appear a losing proposition. Financial planners say losing 1-2 years\u2019 premium is better than continuing a policy that will yield a return of barely 5-6% for the next 10-15 years. They say it is better to take that loss and invest the future premiums in more lucrative avenues."

Interestingly, the Chinese variant of the GT 7 closely resembles what is being referred to as the GT 7T in India. In fact, there isn\u2019t a GT 7T model in China at all. On top of that, the Indian version of the GT 7 isn\u2019t getting the Dimensity 9400+ chip found in the Chinese variant. Realme has officially confirmed that both the GT 7 and GT 7T will launch globally \u2014 including in India \u2014 on May 27. The launch event is set to take place in Paris, France, with the start time scheduled for 1:30 PM IST. Both phones are expected to go on sale via Realme\u2019s official website, Amazon India, and across other online and offline retail channels. While Realme hasn\u2019t revealed any pricing just yet, we can take some clues from last year\u2019s GT 6 series. The Realme GT 6 and GT 6T launched in India at starting prices of Rs 40,999 and Rs 30,999, respectively. So, it\u2019s fair to expect the GT 7 and GT 7T to be priced similarly.

The new video suggests that Tesla is not only making technical progress but also building public interest in Optimus through relatable moments. Whether the robot will be painting walls, working in warehouses or helping at home, the latest glimpse adds to the growing curiosity about its future role in society."

For those who don\u2019t know, Realme has already released the GT 7 duo in China, but until the Indian versions are officially unveiled, we can\u2019t be certain how similar they\u2019ll be to their Chinese counterparts. Interestingly, the Chinese variant of the GT 7 closely resembles what is being referred to as the GT 7T in India. In fact, there isn\u2019t a GT 7T model in China at all. On top of that, the Indian version of the GT 7 isn\u2019t getting the Dimensity 9400+ chip found in the Chinese variant. Realme has officially confirmed that both the GT 7 and GT 7T will launch globally \u2014 including in India \u2014 on May 27. The launch event is set to take place in Paris, France, with the start time scheduled for 1:30 PM IST. Both phones are expected to go on sale via Realme\u2019s official website, Amazon India, and across other online and offline retail channels. While Realme hasn\u2019t revealed any pricing just yet, we can take some clues from last year\u2019s GT 6 series. The Realme GT 6 and GT 6T launched in India at starting prices of Rs 40,999 and Rs 30,999, respectively. So, it\u2019s fair to expect the GT 7 and GT 7T to be priced similarly.

The unexpected turn is the result of a complex interplay of issues\u2014electoral calculus, state-level pressures and a recognition that caste realities can no longer be ignored, even for a party that built its brand on the promise of a \u2018casteless\u2019 Hindutva nationalism. There\u2019s also a bevy of state elections coming up, most importantly in Bihar, where being on the right side of the caste cohort debate could pay rich dividends. Indeed, many see the caste survey as a political gamble aimed at outflanking Mandal-era parties on their home turf, blunting the Congress\u2019s social justice pitch, and recasting the BJP as the new custodian of the Bahujan samaj."

Right now, unfortunately, India isn't in the top 10 by size, but it is one of the fastest-growing markets on Airbnb. And I really believe India is a long game. Over time, I think it will become one of the biggest markets for us. Just look at the demographics - India has a huge population of Gen Z and millennials, and this group disproportionately chooses Airbnb compared to older generations... We're going to be investing significantly in India in the coming years. Amid escalating geopolitical tensions and tariff disruption, have you observed significant shifts in global travel patterns or traveller sentiment? We've seen some changes, but no major shifts so far. When cross-border travel slows, domestic travel often picks up - and we have strong local markets that help balance things out. We saw this during the pandemic."

            "title": "How Singhi Advisors built a reputation as India's go-to M&amp;A specialist",
            "text": "In an M&A landscape dominated by volume metrics and market noise, Singhi Advisors has quietly built a powerhouse brand grounded in trust, precision, and insight. In a world where financial advisory firms often market scale over substance, Singhi Advisors stands as a refreshing outlier\u2014a brand that has quietly but confidently shaped the Indian M&A landscape with insight, integrity, and impact. It all started in 1989, when Singhi Associates entered India's rapidly transforming business environment. With a clear vision but little fanfare, the firm began offering advisory solutions that prioritized depth over dazzle. Rather than rely on high-gloss pitches, Singhi focused on something marketers can relate to: customer intimacy and insight-led problem-solving. Their approach? Embedded advisory. Long before 'consultative selling' became a buzzword, Singhi was already inside boardrooms and across factory floors\u2014deeply integrating with client operations to co-create business solutions. That unique positioning soon became their brand's foundation. By 2005, as India's liberalized economy opened the floodgates of cross-border opportunity, Singhi pivoted. The firm rebranded as Singhi Advisors and doubled down on M&A\u2014a bold move that transformed it from a generalist player to a niche powerhouse. For marketers, this is a masterclass in brand focus. While others diversified, Singhi specialized. They aligned their messaging, capabilities, and culture around one promise: 'Where Deals Get Done'. What started as a tagline evolved into a brand truth\u2014reinforced by over 1,000 strategic transactions. Singhi didn't rely on traditional marketing to build its name. No splashy campaigns. No heavy ad spends. Instead, the firm grew through reputation marketing\u2014referrals, repeat business, and relationships. Over time, its name became synonymous with precision execution in mid-market M&A, especially in complex, cross-border deals. Still, the brand wasn't static. It adapted. As storytelling became central to B2B engagement, Singhi began embracing digital platforms to showcase thought leadership\u2014crafting content that not only informs but resonates with the C-suite. What truly sets Singhi Advisors apart is its evolved brand identity. The firm is now positioning itself as more than a dealmaker\u2014it's becoming 'The Deal Factory'. Think of it as a B2B brand ecosystem: a place where insight meets execution, where process, expertise, and trust converge to create repeatable value for clients. From project advisory ('From Concept to Commissioning') to strategic turnaround initiatives ('Revitalizing Business Potential') and global dealmaking ('Connecting Businesses Beyond Borders'), the firm has built sub-brands that reinforce its credibility and differentiate its capabilities. Singhi\u2019s recent expansion into Pune and Ahmedabad, with Hyderabad on the horizon, reflects more than operational scale\u2014it signals strategic intent. Even more telling is the firm\u2019s exploration of launching a global buyout fund\u2014a move that shifts its brand from pure advisor to potential capital partner. For marketers, it's a shift from service provider to strategic enabler. Three brand pillars anchor Singhi's identity: knowledge, trust, and conviction. These values don't just decorate the website\u2014they guide how the firm shows up in every pitch, deal, and client relationship. That's brand authenticity in action. And while many firms measure success in numbers, Singhi takes a more strategic view: long-term value creation. Every deal isn't just a close\u2014it's a chapter in a client's growth story. That's how Singhi Advisors has managed to stay relevant, trusted, and respected in an increasingly transactional space."

The supermarket chain will use proceeds to expand its store network and halve its \u20b9500 crore debt. Amazon and Samara Capital-owned food and grocery supermarket chain More Retail is planning a \u20b92,000 crore initial public offering (IPO) in the next 12-18 months, said managing director Vinod Nambiar. The proposed IPO will be mostly through fresh capital raising, with no significant offer-for-sale component, as the promoters, Samara Capital, and Amazon's investment entity in Singapore-with 51 per cent and 48 per cent stakes respectively-are unlikely to offload their holdings, Nambiar told reporters on Monday. The balance 1 per cent is held by high net worth individuals and family offices through holding company More Consumer Brands. This fiscal, it expects to post an Ebitda profit of \u20b960 crore, Nambiar said. 'In about two years, we expect to be net profit positive. We should not lose cash from the operations. This fiscal, we are also targeting \u20b96,000 crore revenue,' he said. More Retail has rationalised its store network by shutting unprofitable stores and exiting markets like Maharashtra including Mumbai, New Delhi and Indore. It also exited from lifestyle categories to focus only on food and grocery. The company has a presence in South India, Punjab, Haryana, Gurugram and Noida, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh. It plans to enter Jharkhand and Odisha this year."

The survey, which collected responses from 4,236 small businesses across 11 Asia-Pacific markets in November and December 2024, including 507 from India, found that 72% of Indian small businesses sought external funds last year; 34% cited rising costs as the primary reason for needing finance, while 32% attributed it to reasons relating to business survival.

Commenting on the survey results, Prafulla Chhajed, a certified practicing accountant with CPA Australia, says that access to finance remains a critical need for small businesses in India. \u201cIn 2024, over 71% of Indian SMEs sought external funding, well above the survey average, primarily to drive business growth. While traditional banks remain the main source for 38% of respondents, there is increasing demand for faster, more flexible credit options. Encouragingly, new solutions are emerging.\u201d"

The report states that India\u2019s tech industry contributed Rs 5,443 crore in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) spending in FY23, with companies going beyond the 2% mandate by leveraging technological expertise, scalability, and structured CSR strategies to drive long-term impact. ET: CSR impact is often amplified through collaboration. How are you working with tech companies, government bodies, and local NGOs to drive holistic development? JS: I believe that effective CSR hinges on collaboration among tech companies, government bodies, and local NGOs. At Nasscom Foundation, our core philosophy of TechForGood drives us to harness technology for inclusive growth and sustainable development. This shift from isolated efforts to co-created, scalable models enhances outcomes and aligns with goals of inclusive growth and digital empowerment. In FY23, 75 leading tech companies spearheaded over 2,610 CSR projects, investing Rs 5,443 crore\u2014surpassing the mandated 2% of profits. These initiatives focused on education, climate action, and digital skilling, leveraging AI and digital platforms to reach millions and create sustainable pathways. Collaboration with the government aligns CSR with national objectives like digital inclusion and skilling, helping bridge regional disparities. Government-backed platforms like the Aspirational Districts Programme have seen a fivefold increase in CSR investment between FY19 and FY23. However, these districts, housing over 15% of India's population, still receive only about 2.15% of total CSR funds."

The move follows CoinDCX\u2019s acquisition of BitOasis in 2024 and is part of a wider strategy to increase international revenue. BitOasis will operate in Bahrain under a Crypto-Asset Services Licence issued by the Central Bank of Bahrain. CoinDCX expects more than 30% of its total revenue to come from the MENA region by 2026, up from the current 20%. The Bahrain platform will offer services to retail, corporate, and institutional clients. New features include premium services for high-net-worth individuals and support for local bank transfers across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). BitOasis Co-Founder and CEO Ola Doudin said the Bahrain launch represents a continuation of the company\u2019s regional growth plans. CoinDCX\u2019s technology team now manages the backend infrastructure of the platform. The move comes amid increased activity in the MENA virtual assets sector, supported by regulatory initiatives and investment in blockchain infrastructure across the region. The market is also shaped by a young population and high levels of internet penetration. According to data from IMARC Consulting, the GCC crypto market was valued at $744.3 million in 2024 and is projected to reach $3.5 billion by 2033, with an annual growth rate of 16.75%. Around 38% of crypto users in the region have annual incomes above $15,000. BitOasis has processed more than $7.4 billion in trading volume since its founding in 2016 and has raised over $40 million in funding. The Bahrain launch follows the platform securing a Virtual Asset Service Provider licence from Dubai\u2019s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority in December 2024."

This implies an upside potential of 30% from the stock's last closing level on Tuesday. Motilal sees two key implications from the recent draft RLMM notification: 1) Should the draft receive regulatory approval, it sees competitive intensity moderating in the medium term. 2) There is scope for further market share expansion for Suzlon given Indian OEMs account for barely 50-60% of new orders and the company's integrated domestic manufacturing capabilities across all key components. According to Motilal, Suzlon is focused on raising its share of EPC contracts in the overall order book (20% now to 50% in the medium term), which will be key in providing greater visibility and control in terms of deliveries. Suzlon Energy is currently valued at 24 times its estimated earnings for FY27, and the brokerage believes Suzlon's valuations are attractive following the recent correction. Shares of Suzlon Energy are currently trading 2.13% higher on Wednesday at \u20b958.85. The stock is up 8% over the last one month, but are down 10% so far in 2025."

            "text": "HomeMarket NewsTata Motors shares fall after analyst downgrades, cut to estimates on cautious JLR outlook Adding to that is a slowdown in the Indian Commercial Vehicle market, and rising competition in the electric PV space, Jefferies said. As a result, Jefferies has cut Tata Motors' Earnings Before Interest, Tax Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) estimates for financial year 2026 and 2027 by 8% and 9%, but has increased its Earnings Per Share (EPS) estimates by 3% to 4%. Citi, who has suspended its rating on Tata Motors, believes that while the management appears positive for its India CV business, there could be some near-term headwinds for the Passenger Vehicles business, particularly within the EV segment. Kotak Institutional Equities has downgraded the stock to \"sell\" from its earlier rating of \"reduce\", with a price target of \u20b9600 per share, implying a potential downside of 15% from current levels. Similar to Jefferies, Kotak sees the near-term to remain challenging for JLR, despite turning net cash in financial year 2025. The challenges could come from weak demand trends in China and the impact of tariffs on the US markets. Loss in market share for Tata Motors in its India CV and PV business also remains an area of concern, according to the brokerage. The brokerage has cut Tata Motors' consolidated EBITDA estimates by 4% and 10% over financial year 2025-2027. Out of the 34 analysts that have coverage on Tata Motors, 19 of them have a \"buy\" rating on the stock, nine say \"hold\", while six have a \"sell\" rating on the stock. Shares of Tata Motors fell as much as 3% on Wednesday before recovering some of the morning losses to trade at \u20b9697.7."

Tuesday's session was a bit of a reset for Indian equities as the benchmark index gave up nearly 40% of what it had gained on Tuesday. However, despite the 350-point drop, the Nifty managed to hold levels of 24,500 on the downside, while also making a higher high on the chart, meaning Tuesday's intraday high being higher than Monday's. The street will also take heart from a tech-led positive close on Wall Street, where the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reversed all the losses for the year. For now, the GIFT Nifty, an early indicator of how the Indian equities are likely to start, is indicating a start in the green for our own markets after Tuesday's fall. Asian markets are mixed. Stocks like Tata Motors, Bharti Airtel, Bharti Hexacom among others will be reacting to their results, as will those stocks who have been added, removed from the MSCI indices.

            "text": "HomeIndia NewsOperation Sindoor sent clear message - terror infrastructure in Pakistan not immune to retaliation, says GK Pillai He added that the temporary cessation of hostilities between India and Pakistan does not signify the end of Operation Sindoor or that India is backing down. He emphasised that this is merely a pause. Modi asserted that India's display of overwhelming force over the past few days was a warning to Pakistan and all other countries. He concluded by stating that India would no longer tolerate terrorism in any form. To discuss the lessons from Operation Sindoor, CNBC-TV18 spoke with GK Pillai, former Home Secretary. Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview. Q: I'd like you to first weigh in on the US role in this crisis. How do you think the US got involved, and what really made Donald Trump go to the extent of saying that they brought India and Pakistan to stop hostilities and stop fighting? Pillai: To an extent, we still do not have full information, but from what has been said, what the Americans have said, and what other news has come out, I think the attacks by the Indian forces on the Pakistani military establishment on the night of the 9th-10th were serious enough that the Pakistanis felt a little threatened about their nuclear weapons cache. I think they then took up the matter with the United States, saying that Pakistan was being put in a position where it might have to react with nuclear weapons. That, I believe, was the point when all the top American officials moved in to intervene. Q: What do you think is the big lesson from Operation Sindoor? We've emerged victorious in terms of hitting terror camps in Pakistan, the command and control centres of the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. We were able to hit Pakistani air bases. But if there were certain lessons from the last week, according to you, which would be the most important?"

            "text": "The Acer Aspire C27 makes a compelling case as a value-driven alternative to premium all-in-one (AIO) desktops, offering solid performance and a space-saving design for users on tighter budgets. Starting at around \u20b960,990, it lands between two extremes: The pricey Apple iMac 27-inch, with its class-leading Retina display, and more limited options like HP\u2019s compact Chromebase. At a glance, the Aspire C27 could pass for a standard monitor. Its slim profile, minimalist bezels, and V-shaped stand help it blend unobtrusively into a workspace. But under the surface, it\u2019s a complete Windows 11-based desktop PC \u2014 the review unit was powered by 12th-Gen Intel Core i5-12450H, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and a 1TB SSD. There are other configurations depending on users' needs. From a hardware standpoint, the Aspire C27 covers many essentials. The internals are well suited for everyday productivity \u2014 think spreadsheets, web browsing, video calls, and even a bit of photo editing. The system runs quietly thanks to efficient mobile-grade components and rarely draws attention to itself with fan noise. It\u2019s well-optimised for typical home or office tasks, delivering smooth performance for general Windows workloads. The Aspire C27 isn\u2019t built for gaming or heavy media production, but it handles day-to-day computing with ease. Benchmarks place it solidly in the mid-range for Windows AIOs, trailing premium options like the iMac but keeping pace with other budget and mid-tier rivals. It can even manage light video or photo editing, though its integrated graphics (or modest MX330 GPU, if equipped) rule out anything beyond casual gaming. The Acer Aspire C27 is a practical, no-nonsense all-in-one that delivers where it matters most: Solid performance, sleek design, and a price tag that makes it an attractive iMac alternative. It\u2019s well suited to students, professionals working from home, or anyone looking for a clean, clutter-free setup without breaking the bank."

The CMF Phone 2 Pro keeps the modular spirit of its predecessor alive, but this time, it\u2019s more refined. It\u2019s the thinnest phone CMF has produced to date, measuring just 7.8mm and weighing 185g \u2014 comfortably slim and light in the hand. The back panel is no longer removable, but the phone retains its signature screw-in wheel for attaching accessories, now redesigned to sit flush with the frame. The CMF Phone 2 Pro isn\u2019t trying to be the flashiest or the fastest phone under \u20b920,000 \u2014 and that\u2019s precisely what makes it so appealing. It focuses on getting the fundamentals right: Good design, decent performance, a great display, and a surprisingly versatile camera setup. Throw in a clean software experience and modular accessories that actually add value, and you\u2019ve got a device that feels more considered than many of its peers.

Beyond Samsung, most Android tablet users prioritise value-for-money offerings, with brands like Xiaomi gaining significant traction.\u201d Apple recorded 18% YoY growth, driven by strong shipments of the iPad 11 Series, which made up 49% of its total volumes. The recent launch of the iPad Air (2025) is expected to further support Apple\u2019s position in the months ahead. Also read: India not ready to take on China's share of iPhone manufacturing: Report Samsung\u2019s growth was largely powered by the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus 5G, which alone contributed 98% of its shipments. Lenovo\u2019s Tab M11 and M9 helped the brand maintain third position, although growth remained muted. Xiaomi, meanwhile, saw a substantial YoY growth of 59%, boosted by its continued appeal in the value-premium segment. \u201cBrands like Samsung, Apple, Lenovo and Xiaomi capitalised on evolving consumer expectations with differentiated offerings across price tiers,\u201d said Menka Kumari, senior analyst at CMR, adding, \u201cThe tablet market is gaining momentum in the premium segment, driven by aspirational consumers seeking high performance and ecosystem value.\u201d Looking ahead, CMR expects the Indian tablet market to grow at a steady 10\u201315% through the rest of the calendar year. The research firm sees increasing demand around the academic admissions season, as well as during upcoming festive promotions. AI-powered features, improved cameras and deeper ecosystem integration are also likely to influence purchase decisions. With over 100 countries now importing Indian tablets and the market becoming more diverse in its offerings, India\u2019s tablet space is evolving rapidly \u2014 combining both global brand presence and rising local demand for performance-driven devices.

The drop in performance came even as the broader group recorded its first annual profit in four years.

SoftBank\u2019s investment business continues to be shaped by broader swings in financial markets. The company\u2019s stock is down around 17% this year, amid persistent market volatility and concern over the global economic outlook. Despite the drag from the Vision Funds, SoftBank Group reported a full-year profit of \u00a51.15 trillion, its first since 2021. The performance was driven by gains in long-standing holdings, including Alibaba, T-Mobile and Deutsche Telekom.

            "text": "HomeEntertainment NewsPrime Video to stream ads in India from June 17, you have to pay \u20b9699 extra for ad free option Amazon Prime Video is officially set to introduce advertisements for viewers in India starting June 17, 2025. In an email sent to Prime members on Tuesday, the company announced that its movies and TV shows will begin including \u201climited advertisements\u201d, while maintaining that the number of ads will be \u201cmeaningfully fewer\u201d than those on traditional TV or other streaming services. For Indian consumers who prefer an uninterrupted viewing experience, Amazon will offer an ad-free add-on at a discounted launch price of \u20b9699 per year or \u20b9129 per month. Originally marked at \u20b9999 per year, this add-on will be available to purchase from the same date ads go live, June 17. The company added that this change will not have any impact on Prime Lite subscribers, who have access to Prime Video\u2019s full library of content, on any single device (TV or mobile) in 720p high-definition with ads. Additionally, there will be no change to the existing price of a Prime membership, which continues to offer a bundle of benefits including free shipping, early access to deals, Prime Music, and more. With the additional \u20b9699 per year, consumers who now want an ad-free experience will have to shell out \u20b92,298 from June 17 on the discounted launch offer, and \u20b92,498 if the ad-free option is increased to \u20b9999 per year. This is more than double the original price that Prime first launched at in India, which was \u20b9999 a year. At tis price, Prime Video also becomes more expensive than JioStar, which offers a four-device, ad-free option at \u20b91,499 a year. But it is still cheaper than Netflix\u2019s top-tier subscription plan of Rs 649 per month. Currently, in terms of subscriber base, Prime Video is the second in India\u2019s OTT space, with roughly 20% share. Hotstar (Now JioStar) is the market leader. However, Live event content such as sports continue to include advertising on both Prime Video and Jiostar. Prime Video began its ad-supported rollout globally in 2024, offering US users an optional $2.99/month upgrade to continue watching without ads. The company says introducing limited advertisements allows it to \u201ccontinue investing in compelling content\u201d and scale up its long-term commitment to original programming."

Drawn from the same communities they serve, Balmitras offer more than just care \u2014 they offer stability, learning and emotional support. Alpa Vora, Child Protection Specialist at UNICEF Maharashtra, said, \u201cIn Jalna, thousands of children are forced to migrate with their families due to drought and poverty. They miss school, live in unsafe conditions, and lose access to basic services. The Balmitra initiative is changing this. Trained youth volunteers now help children stay in their villages, attend school, access health services, and participate in after school and mental wellbeing activities.

            "text": "In the middle of a heightened conflict with India last week, cash-strapped Pakistan managed to secure a loan of $1 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). India registered its protest at the board of IMF, but abstained from voting at the crucial meeting, leading to the question \u2013 why did India abstain from voting in the middle of war-like conditions with Pakistan instead of voting \u2018no\u2019? According to Indian government sources, India abstained from the vote because IMF rules do not permit a formal \u2018no\u2019 vote. They added that the rules allow either any of the 25 directors, who represent member countries or groups of countries, to vote in favour of a proposal or abstain to show their disapproval. The consensus-based approach of the IMF means that hostile voting is rare and can lead to diplomatic isolation or perceived disruptions in global financial stability. India, aiming to establish itself as a responsible global player, refrained from voting against Pakistan to avoid destabilising regional stability. India also recognises the potential consequences of a collapsing Pakistani economy, including increased militancy and refugee flows that could destabilise neighbouring regions."

            "text": "To my surprise, ChatGPT broke down the details in very simple language. It not only explained the results but also suggested possible treatment options and listed some of the best doctors in India for the identified deficiencies. That night, I found myself in an extended conversation with AI\u2013asking it a series of questions, almost like I would ask a doctor. Of course, I knew I was speaking to an AI tool, not a qualified medical professional. Yet, when I later discussed the findings with my doctor, I was amazed to see that much of what ChatGPT had explained matched the medical advice I received. Dr Swapnil M Khadake, head, critical care at Fortis Hiranandani Hospital, Vashi, noted that the growing popularity of AI health apps like ChatGPT is changing how patients engage with doctors. He shared his experience with patients. \u201cPeople now come to us having already discussed symptoms and potential diagnoses with these apps. Some even arrive with specific questions or preconceived notions, all shaped by what the apps have told them.\" \u201cThis ChatGPT trend reflects the direction healthcare is heading,\" said Dr Khadake. \u201cMedical professionals will increasingly encounter patients who consult AI tools before seeing a doctor. Our job is to correct misconceptions, ensure accurate understanding, and educate patients about the limitations of artificial intelligence in medical diagnosis.\" Dr Rajeev Jayadevan believes that while technology like ChatGPT is helpful for professionals, it should be used as a supportive tool, not a standalone diagnostic source. \u201cAI can help broaden a clinician\u2019s thinking by suggesting possibilities they might not immediately consider\u2014similar to ordering an additional lab test,\" he said. In short, AI like ChatGPT is transforming how we use healthcare, but it\u2019s not a replacement for medical professionals or doctors. If used wisely, it can empower patients and support doctors. One thing is clear\u2014the future of medicine isn\u2019t man versus machine but it\u2019s their collaboration."

Here's a look at the key takeaways:'Bharat Mata ki Jai' - More than a sloganPM Modi said the chant of “Bharat Mata ki Jai” is not just a slogan but the very resolve of Indian soldiers. “It is an oath… the strength behind every mission. Enemies hear this when our drones and missiles strike,” he said.\n",
      "“Even when we light up the night like day, that’s what echoes from the skies,” he added.

      "Operation Sindoor is India’s new doctrineCalling it more than just a military campaign, PM Modi said, “‘Operation Sindoor’ is the confluence of India’s policy, intent, and decision-making ability.” He added, “Because of your courage, its echoes are being heard around the world.”Direct reference to Operation SindoorPM Modi revealed that the enemy tried to repeatedly attack Adampur airbase and others during Operation Sindoor. “They targeted us again and again, but failed each time. Their designs were foiled.”‘Hum ghar mein ghus ke marenge’ is policy now PM Modi declared that India’s strategy is crystal clear. “We will enter their homes and eliminate terrorists. We won’t even give them a chance to escape,” he said, calling it the “new normal” post-Operation Sindoor.9 terror hideouts destroyed, 100+ terrorists killedPM Modi said Indian forces struck from the front, destroyed nine major terror bases, and eliminated over 100 terrorists in Operation Sindoor.‘Our Air Force hit pinpoint targets inside Pakistan in 20–25 minutes’PM Modi credited the IAF for executing high-risk precision strikes deep in enemy territory using modern tech.'Voice of the nation' in every mission“‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ echoes not just in the battlefield but during every mission,” the PM said. “When our soldiers raise this slogan, it shakes the enemy to the core.”'You’ve raised India’s pride to new heights'“Through Operation Sindoor, you increased the country’s self-confidence, united the nation, and elevated our pride,” he said.Countering nuclear blackmailPM Modi sent a strong signal, saying, “When our armed forces neutralise nuclear blackmail, our enemies realise the meaning of ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’.”Tribute to IAF bravery“I’ve come here to salute your courage,” he told the Indian Air Force personnel. “Your bravery ensures the country sleeps in peace.”Air Force stunned enemy with precision strikes He praised the Indian Air Force for striking terror bases deep inside Pakistan with “speed and accuracy,” adding, “Pakistan will not sleep peacefully for a long time just thinking about our drones and missiles.”Pakistan’s drone threats failed miserably “All of Pakistan’s drones, UAVs, aircraft, and missiles failed before our capable air defence,” PM Modi said. “You have done a fantastic job,” he told the IAF.‘Laxman Rekha’ against terrorism is non-negotiable PM reiterated India’s red lines, any terror attack will trigger a definitive response, on India’s own terms and timeline. “India has drawn a clear line: If there is another terror attack, the reply will come at our time, in our way,” he said. “We will not tolerate nuclear blackmail or separate governments from terror masterminds.”‘India has best global tech; now excels in tech-tactic integration’“In the last decade, world’s best technologies have entered our forces. But running, managing and executing them well is the real game, you’ve nailed it,” he said. “We don’t just fight with weapons anymore. Today’s India also fights with drones, data, and precision technology.” Terror godfathers can’t hide anymore “The godfathers of terrorism now know that casting an evil eye on India means destruction,” he warned. “There is no place in Pakistan where terrorists can live in peace.”No difference between terror groups and their sponsors PM Modi said India will no longer separate terror masterminds from state sponsors, directly calling out Pakistan’s dual game.India’s warrior legacy invoked PM Modi invoked Guru Gobind Singh to describe India’s fighting spirit. “When the sindoor of our daughters was snatched, we responded by crushing the terrorists in their homes.”Armed forces ‘showed Pakistani army its place’ “Our Army, Air Force, and Navy made the Pakistani army bite the dust,” he said. “We dusted them off and gave them the message—terrorists cannot hide anywhere.” He said every moment of Operation Sindoor stands as a testament to the valour and supremacy of India’s Army, Navy, and Air Force.‘Our objective was terror HQs; we avoided civilian aircraft placed in harm's way’PM Modi said that Pakistan tried to use civilian aircraft as human shields. “You achieved the mission without harming a single civilian plane, I am proud of that.”'Aatank ke aakaon ko samajh aa gaya hai...'PM Modi warned terror masterminds that any misadventure against India would end in \"tabaahi aur mahavinaash\" (destruction and devastation).‘Jointness’ on display: Army, Navy, Air Force worked as one PM Modi praised the seamless coordination between the three wings of the armed forces, calling it true \"jointness.\"Pakistan tried, but every airbase stood strong Despite multiple attempts by Pakistan to retaliate, India’s airbases and defence infrastructure remained unharmed, thanks to strong air defences.Machines and men worked as one unit PM highlighted the synchronisation of technology and human skill during Operation Sindoor, saying it reflects India’s advanced warfare capabilities.Decade of defence transformation PM Modi said that in the past 10 years, India has acquired the world’s best defence equipment and combined technology with tactical excellence.‘India is for peace, but will make enemy bite dust if provoked’Reasserting India’s strategic posture, PM Modi said, “We always prefer peace—but if attacked, we will make the enemy bite the dust.”‘India has only paused military action, not ruled it out’“India has only suspended its military action. If Pakistan initiates any terrorist or military activity, we will respond—on our own terms.”PM Modi quotes poetry on warhorse Chetak to praise modern weaponryReferring to lines written about Maharana Pratap’s horse Chetak, Modi said they now apply to today’s Indian weapons:\"Kaushal dikhlaya chaalo mein, Udd gaya bhayanak bhaalo mein, Nirbhik gaya vo dhaalo mein, Sarpat dauda karwalo mein\"—calling modern Indian weaponry fearless, swift and lethal.\n",

She also urged them not to visit these two countries, which earn a large chunk of money through tourism, and visit other countries as part of holiday plans that backed India in its fight against terrorism.\\n\\nJai Hind. A message for Türkiye and Azerbaijan and our tourists planning to head there. Be aware. Be Indian. pic.twitter.com/xXKIcZVUof— Priyanka Chaturvedi🇮🇳 (@priyankac19) May 13, 2025\\n\\nAll this has led to a widespread call for boycotting Turkish products, and many are discouraging fellow Indians to avoid travelling to Ankara. Several traders say they have now decided to boycott Turkish apples.\\n\\n#WATCH | Pune, Maharashtra: Following Turkey’s support for Pakistan amid recent tensions with India, Apple traders in Pune say they have decided to boycott Turkish applesSuyog Zende, an apple trader at Pune’s APMC market, says, “We have decided to stop buying apples from… pic.twitter.com/tldXdCF4p7\\n\\n“We have decided to stop buying apples from Turkey because it supports Pakistan, and instead prefer to buy apples from Himachal and other areas. India was taking action against terrorism, but Turkey supplied drones to Pakistan. Retail customers are also saying that they do not want Turkish apples,\" said Suyog Zende, an apple trader at Pune’s APMC market.\\n\\nSeveral Indians are boycotting travel to Turkey and have called on airlines to suspend any form of partnership with the country. “India must re-define its relations with Turkey. Any agreement on route-sharing between any Indian airlines and Turkish airlines must be terminated,\" said former UP police chief Prakash Singh.\\n\\nIndia must re-define its relations with Turkey. Any agreement on route-sharing between any Indian airlines and Turkish airlines must be terminated. @PMOIndia, @MoCA_GoI— Prakash Singh (@singh_prakash) May 12, 2025\\n\\nMoreover, Goa Villas has decided not to offer any accommodation services to Turkish citizens in Goa in light of Ankara’s stance during the India-Pakistan conflict. Some people have even opted for Greece as a suitable travel destination rather than Turkey.\\n\\nDue to Turkey’s non-cooperative stance in the current global scenario involving India and Pakistan, we’ve decided not to offer any accommodation services to Turkish citizens in Goa. We stand firmly with our nation.Jai Hind 🇮🇳\\n\\nUdaipur marble traders said that they have ended their business with Turkey for siding with Pakistan at such a crucial juncture.\\n\\n“Udaipur is Asia’s biggest exporter of marble. All members of the committee had unanimously agreed to stop trade with Turkiye because of its support to Pakistan… 70% of the marble imported to India comes from Turkiye… Not just Udaipur, if all marble associations stop their trade with Turkiye, it will give a strong message to the world that the Indian government is not alone, industries and all Indians stand with our government… If we stop trade with Turkiye, the demand for Indian marble will grow,\" Kapil Surana, President of Udaipur Marble Processors Committee, said.\\n\\nThis is Greece. It’s beautiful. It’s the arch-rival of Turkey. They vocally support us, while Turkey supplies weapons to Pakistan to attack us.Travel to Greece, not Turkey. Give business to our friends, not our enemies. It’s the bare minimum you can do for the country. pic.twitter.com/gev9vafmjI\\n\\nNo. And that’s a promise.I don’t care how cheap Turkish Airline tickets are. #NeverForget https://t.co/E0QWrNBPC0\\n\\n“Can we please cancel our bookings for Turkey. This is my request to all Indian Celebs/Influencers/Travellers. This is the least we can do as Indians,\" said TV actress Rupali Ganguly.\\n\\nCan we please cancel our bookings for Turkey. This is my request to all Indian Celebs/Influencers/Travellers. This is the least we can do as Indians.#BoycottTurkey— Rupali Ganguly (@TheRupali) May 13, 2025\\n\\nIt’s not only Turkey, even Azerbaijan came to Pakistan’s support and “condemned\" India’s Operation Sindoor strikes, which targeted terror camps inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). It expressed solidarity with Pakistan during the conflict.\\n\\nAs such, people have started avoiding travel to Azerbaijan. “Indians gave Rs 4,000+cr to Turkey & Azerbaijan last year through tourism. Created jobs. Boosted their economy, hotels, weddings, flights. Today, both stand with Pakistan after Pahalgam attack. Plenty of beautiful places in India & the world. Please skip these 2 places,\" said businessman Harsh Goenka.\\n\\nIndians gave Rs 4,000+cr to Turkey & Azerbaijan last year through tourism. Created jobs.

These two countries are blatantly supporting Pakistan and have taken strong anti India stance.It makes sense for tourists from India to boycott these two countries. We should not fly Turkish airlines too.…\\n\\n“Azerbaijan and Turkey earns lot of money because of Indian tourists. These two countries are blatantly supporting Pakistan and have taken strong anti-India stance. It makes sense for tourists from India to boycott these two countries,\" said another individual on X.\\n\\nBoth Turkey and Azerbaijan emerged as top international getaways for Indian tourists in recent years, thanks to their vibrant culture, striking Islamic and Ottoman-era architecture, friendly locals, and easy visa processes. A total of 5 crore Indian tourists visited these two countries in 2024, thanks to easy visas and direct flights. When Turkey was hit by a devastating earthquake in 2023, India started ‘Operation Dost’ to help Ankara.\\n\\nAfter the Pahalgam attack and India’s anti-terror ops, Indian businesses have also altered their partnerships in light of national sentiment. EaseMyTrip, a popular Indian travel booking platform, released an official advisory discouraging travel to both Turkey and Azerbaijan.\\n\\nWatch India Pakistan Breaking News on CNN-News18.

The movement, fueled by nationalist sentiment and outrage over perceived betrayal, has seen significant impacts across various sectors. \\n\\nInitially sparked by online calls for a boycott, the movement quickly gained traction, leading to widespread cancellations of travel bookings to both countries. Major travel platforms like EaseMyTrip have issued advisories strongly discouraging travel to Turkey and Azerbaijan. Indian businesses are altering partnerships, and individuals are canceling their plans, reflecting a powerful display of national sentiment.\\n\\nKey elements driving the boycott include:\\n\\n*   **Perceived Support for Pakistan:** Both Turkey and Azerbaijan were accused of providing support to Pakistan following the J&K attack and India’s counter-operations.\\n*   **Operation Sindoor:** The military operation targeting terror camps within Pakistan and PoK solidified the perception of betrayal.\\n*   **Tourism Revenue:** India has historically invested significantly in tourism to these countries, further amplifying the feeling of a broken commitment.\\n\\n**Specific Actions:**\\n\\n*   **Travel Cancellations:** Hundreds of thousands of planned trips to Turkey and Azerbaijan have been cancelled.\\n*   **Business Alterations:**  Businesses are reassessing partnerships and are reducing engagements with Turkish and Azerbaijani companies.\\n*   **Consumer Boycott:** Individuals are refusing to purchase Turkish products and are avoiding spending money in establishments connected to the countries.\\n*   **Social Media Campaign:** A highly active social media campaign, utilizing hashtags like #BoycottTurkey and #BoycottAzerbaijan, has amplified the movement.\\n\\n**Notable Voices:**\\n\\n*   **EaseMyTrip:** Issued a formal advisory discouraging travel to both countries.\\n*   **Vishal Mishra:** Publicly vowed never to travel to Turkey or Azerbaijan.\\n*   **Harsh Goenka:** Highlighted the substantial investment in tourism to these nations.\\n\\nThis widespread boycott represents a significant display of national solidarity and underscores the impact of geopolitical events on consumer behavior and business operations within India.\"\n",

       " 'But that has changed since its listing in Indian markets in October last year. When the Indian arm of South Korea-based Hyundai declares its earnings for the January to March quarter on 16 May, it will have to face some probing questions from independent investors, who own roughly about 17% of the company.',\n",

Both Tata and Mahindra are fairly close to the company, retail data shows. Tata Motors sales declined by 0.7% to reach 535,960 cars in FY25. Mahindra recorded a surge of 20% in sales to 512,626.',\n",
       " 'While Hyundai took relief from the fact that it was able to retain its second place, the fiscal year 2026 started on a rough note.',\n",

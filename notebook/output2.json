            "text": "The Supreme Court reprimanded Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah for his \"irresponsible\" remarks about Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, emphasizing that individuals in constitutional roles must exercise caution, especially during sensitive operations like Operation Sindoor. Shah's comments, suggesting the Prime Minister sent a \"terrorists' sister\" to harm them, led to widespread condemnation and a High Court order for an FIR against him. NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday pulled up Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah for his \"irresponsible\" comments on Colonel Sofiya Qureshi.A bench of CJI BR Gavai and Justice AG Masih reminded Shah that a person holding a constitutional post must exercise restraint, especially when the country is facing a situation like Operation Sindoor. The top court criticised Shah, who sought a stay of the HC order for an FIR for his irresponsible comments, and asked why he can't approach the high court. \"What sort of statements are you making. You are a responsible minister of the government,\" the CJI told Shah's counsel.Minister's counsel Vibha Makhija said the minister's comment has been over-hyped and that he has apologised.This comes a day after the Madhya Pradesh High Court, in a strongly worded order, directed the state DGP to immediately register an FIR against Shah under several provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), warning that failure to comply would result in contempt proceedings.The FIR is to be filed under BNS Sections 152 (acts endangering sovereignty, unity and integrity of India), 196(1)(b) (promoting enmity on grounds of religion), and 197(a)(c) (outraging modesty or character of a woman through speech), with immediate effect.Shah sparked a major controversy with comments which appeared to be directed at Colonel Qureshi. In a video which has gone viral, the BJP leader is seen saying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent a \"terrorists' sister from their community\" to kill them. This drew wide-scale condemnation, with the opposition Congress demanding his immediate dismissal from the Madhya Pradesh cabinet. Under severe flak, Shah said if anyone is hurt by his statement, he is \"ready to apologise 10 times,\" adding that he respects Colonel Qureshi \"more than I respect my sister.\"Colonel Qureshi held regular press briefings, where she was joined by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh, to give details of the \"Operation Sindoor\" launched by the Indian armed forces to strike terrorists in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

He highlighted India's precise strikes on terror infrastructure within Pakistan and PoK, which successfully neutralized Pakistan's retaliatory efforts. Rubin emphasized that India's diplomatic victory lies in shifting global focus onto Pakistan's support for terrorism, exposing the deep ties between the Pakistani military and terrorist organizations. Pakistan went running to try to achieve ceasefire like a scared dog: Former Pentagon official NEW DELHI: Pakistan ran like a \"scared dog with its tail between its legs to secure a ceasefire\" after India thwarted its missile and drone attacks, said Michael Rubin a former Pentagon official. He acknowledged India's precision attack on terror hideouts and infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK and said that it was able to blunt Pakistan's response following the recent strikes.Talking to news agency ANI, he said that Pakistan and its army cannot shield itself from the truth that it \"lost very, very badly.\"When asked about Operation Sindoor launched by India on May 7, Rubin said, \"India won this both diplomatically and militarily. The reason why India won diplomatically is all attention is now on Pakistan's terrorist sponsorship.\" On the officials of Pakistan's armed forces attending the funeral of terrorists, he said, \"it shows that there is no differentiation between a terrorist and a member of the ISI or the Pakistani armed forces.\" 'Pakistan has started every single war with India'\"Basically, the world is going to demand that Pakistan extract the rot from its own system. So, diplomatically, India changed the conversation, militarily, Pakistan is shocked.\" He further said that Pakistan has initiated every single war with India and somehow convinced itself that it won even after losing them. \"One thing that we can say with certainty is that Pakistan has started every single war with India and yet convinced itself that somehow it has won. It's going to be very different. to convince themselves that they won this 4-day war. The reason is. India was able to, with precision, decimate the terror headquarters and training camps,\" Rubin said. \"When Pakistan responded, India was able to blunt their response and then, when Pakistan continued to try to retaliate, India was able to put their airfields out of commission,\" he added.'Scared dog with its tail between its legs'He continued, \"Pakistan went running to try to achieve a ceasefire like a scared dog with its tail between its legs. And the fact of the matter is, there is absolutely no spin that the Pakistani military can put on what occurred to shield themselves from the full reality of the fact that they not only lost but they lost very, very badly.\" Rubin further asked, is Asim Munir going to resign? \"The question now, however, is what Pakistan will do next. Clearly, there's a problem within the Pakistani military, both because it's a cancer on Pakistani society and because, as a military, it's incompetent and so is Asim Munir going to keep his job? Is the ego of Pakistani generals going to trump the future strength and well-being of all of Pakistani society? Basically, Pakistan needs to clean house, but it's an open question whether they are too far gone to do that,\" he added.Indian armed forces on May 7 launched Operation Sindoor in response to Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, which claimed lives of 26 people. The armed forces targeted terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, leading to the death of over 100 terrorists affiliated with terror outfits like the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Hizbul Mujahideen (HM).After Operation Sindoor, Pakistan started crossborder shelling across the Line of Control and Jammu and Kashmir. It attempted several missile and drone attacks along the border regions. India strongly retaliated and damaged radar infrastructure, communication centres and airfields across airbases in Pakistan. India and Pakistan reached an understanding on the cessation of hostilities on May 10.

            "text": "The Allahabad High Court has stated that Muslim men can marry more than once if they treat all wives equally, referencing Quranic permission for polygamy under specific conditions. This ruling came during a case involving Furkan, accused of bigamy and rape for marrying without disclosing his existing wife. The court dismissed the charges, acknowledging Muslim law allows multiple wives, and ordered further investigation while protecting Furkan from coercive action. NEW DELHI: The Allahabad high court recently ruled that a Muslim man is entitled to marry more than once, provided he treats all his wives equally.A single bench of Justice Arun Kumar Singh Deswal made the observation while hearing a petition related to charges against a man named Furkan in Moradabad.The court noted that polygamy is permitted under the Quran \u201cfor a valid reason\u201d but is often \u201cmisused\u201d by men for \u201cselfish reasons,\u201d a report by Bar & Bench website said. \u201cThis Court would further like to observe that Article 25 of the Constitution of India gives religious freedom to profess, practice and propagate, which also includes external overt acts of individual as per his religious faith, but this right is subject to public order, morality and health and other provisions of Part-III of the Constitution. Therefore, religious liberty under Article 25 is not unfettered and can be regulated by the State,\u201d the judgment said, as per the Bar & Bench report.The bench explained that polygamy was allowed historically to protect widows and orphans in the early Islamic community. \u201cThere was a time in history when a large number of women were widowed, and children were orphaned in primitive tribal tussles in Arabs. The Muslims suffered heavy casualties in defending the nascent Islamic community in Medina. It was under such circumstances that the Quran allowed conditional polygamy to protect orphans and their mothers from exploitation,\u201d it said.The case relates to a 2020 complaint by a woman who accused Furkan of marrying her without disclosing he had another wife. She also alleged rape during the marriage. Police issued summons to Furkan and two others.The case began after a woman said Furkan did not tell her he was already married when they wed. Furkan\u2019s lawyer argued that Muslim law allows a man to marry up to four wives.The court ruled that the charges of bigamy and rape did not apply, as the marriage was valid. It said the matter needed further examination and issued a notice to the complainant.Meanwhile, the police were ordered not to take any coercive action against Furkan or the other accused. Furkan was represented by advocates Alok Kumar Pandey, Prashant Kumar, and Susheel Kumar Pandey.

Microsoft's recent round of layoffs has hit software engineers hardest, with over 40% of the approximately 2,000 positions eliminated in Washington state belonging to coding professionals, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg.The tech giant announced Tuesday it would cut around 6,000 workers company-wide, representing less than 3% of its 228,000-person workforce.

            "text": "In Bareilly, two women, Asha (Golu) and Jyoti, both deceived about their husbands' religious identities, have forged an unconventional bond. Estranged from family and societal norms, they found solace in shared experiences and decided to \"marry\" in a temple ceremony. BAREILLY: In a small temple not far from Bareilly's district court, two women stood side by side on Tuesday morning, surrounded not by family but by lawyers. There were no garlands or rituals steeped in tradition \u2014 only a shared decision to forge a new path together, one that diverged sharply from the ones they had once walked.Each had been married to a man who withheld the truth about his religious identity, a deception that unravelled not just the legal contract of marriage but their sense of personal trust. What followed for both women was estrangement \u2014 from their families, social norms, and certainty itself. What brought them together was that shared fracture.Asha, 27, who now goes by the name Golu, lives in Delhi and works at a baby care centre. Jyoti, 29, is from Civil Lines in Budaun and is the elder of two sisters. When they met at a factory in Delhi three months ago, their conversations were, at first, simply a form of survival \u2014 trading stories, finding solidarity in small truths. But soon they noticed parallels that extended beyond coincidence. Both had been misled at a fundamental level by men they were expected to trust implicitly.Both had walked away, unsupported. Both were trying, quietly, to rebuild.Their closeness deepened not through grand gestures but through the accumulation of smaller moments \u2014 workday chats, shared meals, evenings filled with the rare comfort of not having to explain. Eventually, they began to imagine a life together. \"We have lost trust in men,\" Jyoti said. \"We decided to marry when we felt we understood each other.\" Theirs is not a legally recognised marriage, at least not under Indian law. But it is a declaration. \"If our families support us, that's fine,\" Golu said. \"Otherwise, we'll live together in Delhi. We plan to work, live well, and build a home when our budget allows.\"While the Supreme Court decriminalised same-sex relationships in 2018 by reading down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, same-sex marriages still hold no legal standing in India. Lawyer Diwakar Verma, who witnessed the temple wedding, said, \"Two women approached us, expressing their desire to marry. The Constitution grants them the right to live together.\" Their decision echoes similar stories emerging from parts of Uttar Pradesh, where women \u2014 pushed to the margins by marital betrayal or domestic abuse \u2014 have sought solace and stability in companionship outside convention. In Jan 2025, two women from Deoria\u2014Kavita and Gunja alias Bablu \u2014 left behind abusive husbands and \"married\" at a temple after meeting on Instagram. In 2018, two women from Hamirpur who had once been in love reunited after years of separation forced by arranged marriages. They divorced their respective husbands and formalised their relationship, though without legal validation.

Who's that IPL player?The talented opener was dropped from the Mumbai domestic squad earlier this year and went unsold in the IPL 2025 mega auction, despite having scored 1892 runs in 79 matches for Delhi Capitals at a strike rate of 147.46. His cryptic post comes just ahead of IPL 2025\u2019s resumption on May 17, following a week-long suspension due to geopolitical tensions. The timing of his message has prompted fans and former cricketers to wonder whether Shaw is hinting at deeper issues or a possible change in direction.

            "text": "A pizza delivery dispute occurred in Bhandup. It involved Vaidehi Pathak and delivery boy Rohit Lavera. The argument started over pizza quality. It then shifted to the use of Marathi language. Pathak insisted Lavera speak Marathi. Lavera, a native of Haryana, refused. MNS intervened, and Lavera apologized. Police have registered a non-cognisable offence and are investigating the matter. Image source: Screengrab from the viral video circulating on social media platform X MUMBAI: A minor quarrel over pizza delivery in Bhandup spiralled into a Marathi versus Hindi debate citywide, sparking a police complaint and a witty meme fest on social media.In a video clip that went viral Tuesday night, Bhandup dentist Vaidehi Pathak and her son of Sai Radha Complex, who had ordered pizza from the local Domino's outlet, insisted that the delivery boy Rohit Lavera, a native of Haryana, speak Marathi, else they would not pay for the order.Both sides engaged in argument, with Pathak saying the youth should return to his home state if he did not know Marathi, while he refused and questioned the compulsion to speak the language. Pathak said this was the custom here, adding that she did not know Hindi.Pathak approached police to file a complaint Wednesday. \"We have registered an NC (non cognisable offence [against Lavera] and are inquiring into the matter,\" said deputy commissioner (zone 7) Vijay Sagar.Speaking to TOI in chaste Hindi Wednesday, Pathak said, \"The incident occurred at 8.00 pm on May 10. A quarrel erupted because my son had demanded to check the pizza before making the payment. The previous time we had ordered, there was spillage from the box. But the delivery boy raised his voice saying we could not open the box and decide to return it, and would have to pay. My son retorted that he should speak Marathi since we could not understand his Haryanvi accent. It was not intentional. I recorded his video only to give him a negative rating for that delivery and to lodge a complaint with Domino's. But it was not right of him to record my video. I kept asking him to speak Marathi but he said, 'Zabardasti hai kya (Is it any compulsion)?'Pathak says she made the payment for the cash on delivery (COD) order online. \"The kid (Lavera) later called me at 11.30 pm and offered to apologise. But his brother circulated the video and it went viral. There is no question of me seeking a free meal or publicity, and no political motive. Why would we not pay for the order?\"Pathak is seeking a written apology from Domino's to \"clear her name\" in the housing society where she lives. \"I live here on rent and my Gujarati landlord is having to explain to the society. I hope this doesn't cause trouble,\" she said.Meanwhile the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) which has revived the insistence on the use of Marathi in public establishments, waded in. Yogesh Sawant, MNS president for the eastern suburbs and vice president, Maharashtra, sought out Pathak on Wednesday to offer support. He also forced Lavera to apologise to her at the local party office.Sawant told TOI, \"\"This delivery boy was born and raised in Bhandup and passed SSC from Ramkali school where Marathi is a compulsory subject. How can he not know Marathi -- he was just being defiant. Also I feel that large corporations like Domino's must conduct police verification of their employees.\"Lavera did not respond to TOI's calls or text message.The incident triggered a meme fest on social media. Some people questioned why the \"only Marathi\" customer had ordered an Italian dish on an English app. One reader feared that such incidents would prompt pizza outlets to halt the cash on delivery mode of payment. Many people expressed concern about preserving the secular social fabric, and the values of the Indian Constitution.

            "text": "Bangladesh has requested an additional $762 million from the IMF, potentially increasing total assistance to $4.1 billion. This request comes as the nation faces macroeconomic challenges, including slowed GDP growth and persistent inflation. The IMF's support is contingent upon Bangladesh undertaking critical reforms, such as exchange rate liberalization and tax improvements, to ensure financial stability. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) confirmed on Wednesday that Bangladesh requested the entity for an additional financial support of $762 million, as the country grapples with mounting macroeconomic challenges.This request, if granted, would bring the total IMF assistance to Bangladesh to approximately $4.1 billion under a mix of credit and sustainability programmes.\"Amid significant macroeconomic challenges, the authorities requested an augmentation of SDR (Special Drawing Rights) 567.2 million (approximately $762 million) in IMF financial support to Bangladesh under the ECF and EFF arrangements,\" said Chris Papageorgiou, IMF mission chief for Bangladesh, quoted by PTI.The IMF plans to disburse $1.3 billion to Bangladesh in June after completing its fourth assessment of the $4.7 billion lending programme. IMF and Bangladeshi authorities reached a staff-level agreement to complete the combined third and fourth reviews under the extended credit facility (ECF), extended fund facility (EFF), and resilience and sustainability facility (RSF). The agreement still awaits approval from the IMF Executive Board, and is contingent on critical prior actions such as full exchange rate liberalisation and tax reforms. If approved, the completion of the reviews would unlock SDR 983.8 million (around $1.3 billion), comprising SDR 650.5 million ($874 million) from the ECF and EFF, and SDR 333.3 million ($448 million) from the RSF.Explaining the reason behind the aid, the IMF said that the Bangladeshi economy is under considerable strain, as its GDP growth slowed to 3.3 per cent year-on-year in the first half of the 2024-25 fiscal year. While a modest rebound to 3.8 per cent is projected for the full year, pressures remain high due to external financing needs and domestic instability.Inflation, which approached double digits earlier in the fiscal year, is now expected to fall to around 8.5% by the end of the year. However, the IMF warned that risks remain tilted to the downside, citing issues within the banking sector and ongoing global uncertainty.To address the challenges, the IMF has urged tighter near-term policy measures, alongside longer-term structural reforms. These include strengthening governance, improving transparency, and enhancing the business climate to attract foreign investment and diversify exports beyond the ready-made garment sector.\u201cInstitutional reforms to bolster the independence and governance of Bangladesh Bank will be essential for ensuring long-term macroeconomic and financial stability and for the effective implementation of broader financial sector reforms,\u201d IMF said."

Bengaluru police arrested Mohammed Mastan for allegedly stealing valuables, including a Rolex watch and diamond rings, from the car of a renowned Bharatanatyam dancer. BENGALURU: Police arrested a cab driver on Wednesday over a case of theft from the boot of the car of a city-based cultural luminary. The stolen items included a Rolex watch, a Bottega wallet, and diamond rings.The accused has been identified as Mohammed Mastan, 46, a resident of Mahalakshmi Layout.Deputy commissioner of police (Central) Shekhar H Tekkannavar said all the stolen items were recovered and further investigation was on.Police verified CCTV footage on the stretch of the road where the car belonging to dancer, was parked and found that a cab driver had stolen the items. Soon, he was tracked down.On May 11, the dancer and actor,had parked her car on Queens Road, with the luxury items in the boot. She then went for a walk in Cubbon Park around 8 am. When she returned about an hour later and checked the boot, much to her shock, the valuables were all missing, along with her AirPods.Between 9.15 am and 9.45 am, when she checked the location of her AirPods on her mobile phone, she found their coordinates on St Mark's Road, but couldn't locate those upon reaching there.Later in the afternoon, she filed a complaint at Cubbon Park police station and a case was registered under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) section 303 (2) for theft. The accused, Mastan, told the police he had parked his car near the bus stop on Queens Road, when he saw the dancer park her car just ahead of his vehicle. He saw her keep some items in the boot. In a hurry, she didn't close the boot properly. Soo after the dancer left, he opened the boot and stole the valuables.He told the police he didn't realise the wristwatch alone was worth Rs 9 lakh, adding that his intention was to sell the diamond rings and make money.The dancer was not available for comments when TOI contacted her.Vikash Kumar, the additional commissioner of police (West) advised citizens to be careful before leaving behind valuables in their vehicles.

This dream, along with surfacing information like Bill's association with Jeffrey Epstein, served as a catalyst. She also experienced panic attacks during the separation, highlighting the emotional toll of ending their 27-year marriage. Microsoft founder Bill Gates ex-wife Melinda French Gates has revealed that a recurring dream played an important role in her decision to end her 27-year marriage. The divorce, which was finalised in 2021, followed the surfacing of certain information that impacted the couple's relationship. In a recent interview French Gates revealed that she experienced recurring nightmares in late 2019. She claimed that the dream turned out be a turning point in her journey. In an interview with enterprenuer Jamie Kern Lima, French Gates described her symbolic dream. Melinda Gates described that in her dream, she saw that she was standing on a cliff along with Bill gates and their children. As the dream progressed, the portion of the cliff where she stood began to crumble and break away. This imagery had a profound effect on her, which she interpreted as a clear sign that she needed to separate and move forward on her own.\u201cI was going to have to make a decision\u2014and I was going to have to make it by myself,\u201d she recalled.\"Some dreams will take me years to understand, but if they\u2019re recurring, I know I need to pay attention to them,\u201d added Melinda Gates. While the dream served as a catalyst, Melinda's decision was also influenced by other factors. While she did not disclose specific details, Melinda acknowledged that certain things came out publicly, reinforcing her decision to leave the marriage. She referenced Bill Gates\u2019 past meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, which she described as deeply disturbing. Bill has previously admitted that associating with Epstein was a mistake.In a recent candid interview with The Times, French Gates addressed Bill Gates\u2019 remarks about their divorce. She said, \u201cIf you can\u2019t live your values out inside your most intimate relationship, it was necessary.\u201d French Gates also opened up about the emotional strain of the divorce, sharing that she experienced panic attacks throughout the separation. \u201cWhen you\u2019re leaving a marriage, it\u2019s very, very hard. And the negotiations were tough,\u201d she said.She shared that her first panic attack occurred in 2014 while having lunch with Gates, prompting her to begin therapy. \u201cI\u2019d heard of people having panic attacks and I didn\u2019t know if it was a real thing,\u201d she said.Initially skeptical of therapy, French Gates admitted she later came to understand its value. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m damaged,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt means I\u2019ve been through some difficult things that I need to figure out.\u201dFollowing the divorce, both Bill and Melinda Gates have continued their philanthropic efforts, though they are no longer working together as a couple. Bill Gates has publicly expressed regret about the divorce, acknowledging his role in the dissolution of their marriage."

The Chenab Bridge section is the final leg that connects Kashmir with rest of India by rail NEW DELHI: On Wednesday, the railways successfully ran its first \u201ctrial special train\u201d, carrying soldiers on the strategically vital Katra-Qazigund section, in a move that signals how govt\u2019s plan to run trains between J&K remains on track, unaffected by the ongoing Indo-Pak conflict. The train made the round trip with full security arrangements, TOI has learnt.The section, which includes the Chenab Bridge, is the final leg that connects Kashmir with the rest of India by rail. The train left Katra around 10am and returned by 6pm, they added.The trial run gains importance considering the ongoing Indo-Pak conflict and Operation Sindoor. PM Narendra Modi was scheduled to inaugurate the section last month, but was postponed due to bad weather. What do you believe is the main advantage of the new train service in J&K? Sources said the special train on trial carried soldiers who were on leave and stuck due to cancellations of flights to J&K. \u201cThe train operation was limited to only the Katra-Qazigund section. Normal train operation is on between Qazigund and Baramulla,\u201d said an official.Earlier, the railways had carried out the trial run of special Vande Bharat trains between Katra and Srinagar, but never carried passengers in them.Wednesday\u2019s successful trial run of the train with passengers also gains importance considering that it will be an additional connectivity to Kashmir and for faster movement of men and machineries. Till now, there was only highway connectivity between J&K, and sometimes bad weather, including landslides, impacted movement.

It was a brief call and Purnam asked about his parents and spoke to his son Aarav.For the next few hours, an overjoyed Devanti Devi, Purnam's elderly mother, stood with boxes of sweets at the door of their house. \"Thora munh meetha kar lijiye (have some sweets),\" she urged everyone she met. Purnam and Rajni's eight-year-old son pointed to a kite and spool kept on the top of a cupboard in their bedroom and said, \"We flew the kite when papa came during Holi. We will fly it again together. I am waiting for him to come home.\" His family is happy and so is the entire nation.\"Rajni said the CM had expressed her wish to meet Purnam when he returned home.Junior Union minister Sukanta Majumdar thanked PM Modi for securing Purnam's release while Bengal leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari met senior BSF officers in Kolkata to express his gratitude.'Nothing will stop him from serving the country again'\"We cannot even imagine what he faced in Pakistan, but nothing will stop him from serving the country again,\" said 62-year-old Bholanath Shaw, an e-rickshaw driver in Rishra whose youngest son Purnam re-entered India through the Attari-Wagah border on Wednesday after spending 22 days in the custody of Pakistan Rangers. On April 23, a day after the Pahalgam terror attack, the BSF jawan had inadvertently crossed over to Pakistan while on operational duty.For over three weeks, Purnam's family members here had swung between hope and despair as the tension between India and Pakistan mounted. Purnam's pregnant wife Rajni even travelled to Ferozepur to seek answers from her husband's seniors in BSF but nothing much materialised. When India launched Operation Sindoor, their hearts sank. \"The day attacks on both sides intensified, I started losing hope. The (BSF) Commanding Officer at Kangra assured me of my husband's return but we couldn't be sure. What if the war escalated and continued for a long time? Fear gripped the entire family,\" recounted RajniFinally on Wednesday morning, Shaw Sadan erupted in joy and tears when the BSF, in a press note, confirmed that Purnam was back home. \"Every citizen of this country prayed for my sindoor and I can't thank them enough,\" said a tearful Rajni, thanking PM Narendra Modi and CM Mamata Banerjee for their help and support.

Aamir plays a basketball coach training intellectually disabled children. The film explores themes of growth and acceptance. It features ten new young actors. Aamir Khan returns to acting after a break. The movie is set to release on June 20. Genelia Deshmukh is back on the big screen, and this time, she\u2019s teaming up with none other than Aamir Khan. The 'Ved' actress recently opened up about her role in the upcoming film \u2018Sitaare Zameen Par\u2019 and called the experience \u201cincredibly special.\u201dThe emotional sports drama, which is set to release on 20 June, sees Aamir playing a strict basketball coach who ends up training a group of intellectually disabled children. Genelia plays his love interest in the film, and though her role is short, it\u2019s left a strong mark on her.A dream collaboration for GeneliaAfter staying away from Bollywood for some time, Genelia is excited to be part of something meaningful again. Talking about the film with IANS, she said, \u201cCollaborating with Aamir Khan productions after all these years feels incredibly special. This role is unlike anything I\u2019ve done before! It\u2019s emotional, layered, and deeply human. I\u2019m truly grateful for the love the trailer has received, and I can\u2019t wait for audiences to experience the film.\u201d Her return to Aamir Khan\u2019s production house is also a bit of a full-circle moment. Fans still remember her as the lovable Aditi from \u2018Jaane Tu\u2026 Ya Jaane Na\u2019, which was backed by Aamir. While that film was a light-hearted love story, \u2018Sitaare Zameen Par\u2019 is more intense and emotional.Aamir Khan like you\u2019ve never seen beforeThe recently released trailer gave fans a glimpse of Aamir Khan in a completely new role. Far from the gentle art teacher he played in \u2018Taare Zameen Par\u2019, this time Aamir is a grumpy, frustrated basketball coach. He\u2019s short-tempered, tough, and not easy to please, but he\u2019s given the task of training a team of special children.The makers shared the trailer with the caption, \u201c1 Tingu Basketball Coach, 10 Toofani SITAARE aur unki journey. Watch #SitaareZameenPar #SabkaApnaApnaNormal, 20th June Only In Theatres. Trailer Out Now!\" The trailer hints at a journey of growth, not just for the children but for Aamir\u2019s character too. It promises laughs, tears, and plenty of feel-good moments.Meet the young stars of the filmOne of the film\u2019s highlights is its young cast. Along with Aamir and Genelia, \u2018Sitaare Zameen Par\u2019 features 10 fresh faces, Aroush Datta, Gopi Krishna Varma, Samvit Desai, Vedant Sharma, Ayush Bhansali, Ashish Pendse, Rishi Shahani, Rishabh Jain, Naman Mishra, and Simran Mangeshkar. These young actors play the team of children who are seen training under Aamir\u2019s character. Their presence brings a sense of honesty and charm to the film, and their bond with the coach seems to be at the heart of the story.Aamir\u2019s big comeback after two yearsThe film also marks Aamir Khan\u2019s return to acting after his 2022 release \u2018Laal Singh Chaddha\u2019. After taking a short break from films, Aamir is back with a role that is emotional, powerful and different from anything he\u2019s done before."

Kuiper plans a substantial infrastructure with ten gateways and two presence points, aiming for commercial launch later this year after recent satellite launches. Amazon submitted its application to DoT approximately two years ago. (AI image) After Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink, Amazon's Project Kuiper, under Jeff Bezos's leadership, is now looking to to enter India's satellite internet sector. It has approached the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) for application approval. The satellite communications sector in India already includes established players like Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb and Reliance Jio-SES JV, both holding GMPCS permits and IN-SPACe clearances. Additionally, Globalstar, Apple's satellite communications partner, has submitted applications to IN-SPACe for operational authorisation in India.The Amazon-supported venture intends to establish substantial satellite communications infrastructure in India, including ten gateways and two presence points situated in Mumbai and Chennai, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation who spoke to ET.A source revealed that the organisation recently submitted correspondence to DoT, seeking quick issuance of a letter of intent for satellite communications authorisation (Global Mobile Personal Communication by Satellite). This communication preceded DoT's recent issuance of an LoI to Starlink, the source confirmed.Amazon submitted its application to DoT approximately two years ago, and with its satellite launches now underway, the company seeks to obtain all necessary approvals before launching commercial services later this year, according to a source familiar with the matter. Kuiper launched 27 satellites into orbit last month, with additional launches scheduled in the upcoming months. The company aims to establish a low earth orbit (LEO) constellation exceeding 3,200 satellites, with the majority expected to be operational by February-March next year.Also Read | Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink issued Letter of Intent by Indian government for satcom servicesIndustry analysts note that these timelines could shift, considering the initial commercial launch experienced several months of delay.Industry specialists indicate that the satellite capacity generated by Kuiper and Starlink, which currently operates over 7,000 LEO satellites, would significantly exceed their competitors. For comparison, Eutelsat OneWeb operates 648 LEO satellites, whilst the Jio-SES partnership will utilise approximately 11 medium earth orbit (MEO) satellites.Starlink intends to establish three gateways in India, whereas Kuiper plans for 10. Eutelsat-OneWeb and Jio-SES will each maintain two gateways.Consequently, the two American companies will provide the bulk of satellite capacity available for use in India.Present non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) satellites in India offer a total bandwidth capacity of roughly 70 gigabits per second (Gbps), while geostationary orbit (GSO) satellites provide approximately 58 Gbps. However, the implementation of LEO constellations will substantially increase this capacity to several terabytes.

NEW DELHI: England wicketkeeper-batter Sam Billings took a cheeky dig at Pakistan's star batter Babar Azam by highlighting their contrasting records in the ongoing Pakistan Super League (PSL) 2025.

In his message, Tharoor recalled how he had admired Kohli across all formats but held a special reverence for his performances in Test cricket.

The court condemned Shah's \u201cgutter language\u201d as disparaging to both the officer and the armed forces. The court cited Shah's use of \"gutter language\" at a public function, finding his comments disparaging to both the officer and the armed forces. BHOPAL/JABALPUR: Madhya Pradesh high court took suo motu cognisance on Wednesday of state minister Vijay Shah\u2019s remarks on Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, one of the two officers who were the face of the Indian armed forces during Operation Sindoor, and ordered the state DGP to register an FIR against him for using \u201cgutter language\u201d against a woman Army officer.SEE ALSO: MP minister Vijay Shah moves Supreme Court after HC orders FIR over \u2018gutter language\u2019 against Colonel Sofiya Qureshi The court ordered that the case be listed on top of the case list on Thursday and warned that if the FIR isn\u2019t filed by then, the DGP will face contempt proceedings. The FIR is to be filed under BNS Section 152, 196(1)(b) (promoting enmity) and 197(a)(c) with immediate effect. A division bench of Justice Atul Shreedharan and Justice Anuradha Shukla said: \u201cThis court has been compelled to take up this matter suo motu on account of an incident published in various newspapers and digital media networks that has taken place at a public function at village Raikunda in Ambedkar Nagar, at Mhow, on Monday. A sitting minister of Madhya Pradesh govt, whose name is Vijay Shah, has used scurrilous language against a senior official of the Indian Army.\u201dThe judges said the armed forces are perhaps the \u201clast institution existing in this country\u201d, reflecting integrity, industry, discipline, sacrifice, selflessness, character, honour and indomitable courage, with which any citizen of this country who values the same can identify themselves with. India\u2019s armed forces have been \u201ctargeted by Vijay Shah who has used the language of the gutters\u201d, the court said.\u201c\u2026the minister made a nauseating remark against Col Qureshi by way of an innuendo which can refer to none other than her alone, as there is no one else who would fit the description of the comment made by the minister,\u201d the bench said. \u201cThere are newspaper reports and a plethora of digital material on the internet in which the minister\u2019s speech is clear and unequivocal\u2026 His comments are disparaging and dangerous not just to the officer in question but to the armed forces itself,\u201d the HC said.His comment \u201cencourages feelings of separatist activities...which endangers the sovereignty or unity and integrity of India. Thus this court is satisfied that first offence made out against him is under BNS Sec 152\u201d, the court said. The bench added that BNS Sec 196 (1b)would be, prima facie, applicable as Col Qureshi is an adherent of Muslim faith.

            "text": "NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday mocked RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav by comparing him to Air Marshal Awadhesh Kumar Bharti, who played a pivotal role in Operation Sindoor as the Director General of Air Operations (DGAO).In a social media post on X, BJP's Bihar unit highlighted the contrast between the two Bihar natives, stating, \"One Bihari (AK Bharti) annihilated his enemies, while another, Lalu's heir, is still struggling to pass on his father's strength.\" A decorated officer, Air Marshal Bharti has been awarded Vayu Sena (VM) and Ati Vishisht Seva (AVSM) medals for his distinguished services.In the run up to the assembly election, which is scheduled at the end of the year, a political slugfest has ensued in Bihar after Congress pulled up chief minister Nitish Kumar for turning his visit to the home of slain BSF jawan Mohammed Imtiaz into what it called a \"red carpet event.\"On Wednesday, Congress alleged that a road was hastily constructed in front of Imtiaz\u2019s house and that red carpets and sofas were arranged in preparation for the chief minister\u2019s visit.\"When Bihar\u2019s CM Nitish Kumar visited the martyr\u2019s home, a red carpet was laid out, comfortable sofas were arranged, and a road was hurriedly constructed. The martyr\u2019s family is distraught, weeping uncontrollably, and the entire nation\u2019s eyes are moist with grief,\" the post said.\"Yet, even on this tragic occasion, Bihar\u2019s chief minister Nitish Kumar couldn\u2019t refrain from his 'event baazi'. This insensitive and crass behaviour is like rubbing salt into the wounds of the martyr\u2019s family. This is utterly shameful. The nation is watching,\" it added.BSF sub-inspector Mohammed Imtiaz was killed when his BSF unit positioned along the international border in RS Pura sector came under heavy Pakistani firing on May 10, amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan following Operation Sindoor.\"He, along with seven others, were wounded. While Imtiaz died of wounds, the others are stable and under treatment at a health facility,\" an official said.

Conversely, silver exhibits strength, consolidating between \u20b995,300 and \u20b997,500. Should you buy or sell gold, and what are the gold and silver price levels you should watch out for? (AI image) Gold and silver price prediction: Gold prices have dipped sharply in the last few days while silver prices are showing strength. Even as some geopolitical tensions around the world weigh, there are signs of the dollar gaining favour. In such a scenario, what is the outlook for gold and silver prices? Should you buy or sell gold, and what are the gold and silver price levels you should watch out for? Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group shares his views:MCX GoldGold prices witnessed a sharp 5% decline last week, bringing the precious metal down to a critical support level near \u20b992,000. This level holds significant technical importance, and as long as it remains unbroken, there is a potential for a rebound. If the support holds, a retracement is likely, targeting at least the 50% Fibonacci level of the recent fall from \u20b997,500 to \u20b992,400. This places the retracement target around \u20b995,000 followed by 61.8% retracement which comes to \u20b995,500. Such a move would be considered a technical pullback, potentially offering short-term buying opportunities.However, the situation remains fragile. A decisive break below \u20b992,000 could negate the possibility of recovery and open the door to further downside momentum. In that case, increased selling pressure could drive gold prices lower, possibly testing the \u20b990,000 mark in the coming sessions.Traders should closely monitor price action around this support zone, as it will likely dictate the short-term trend. While fundamentals such as inflation concerns or geopolitical tensions can influence gold, technical levels like these often act as key decision points for market participants. Overall, \u20b992,000 is a make-or-break level for gold, and the market\u2019s behaviour around this point will be crucial in determining its next move. MCX SilverSilver prices have been exhibiting a positive formation in recent weeks, indicating underlying strength in the trend. However, during the last week, the metal entered a consolidation phase, trading within a narrow range with key resistance at \u20b997,500 and support at \u20b995,300. This range-bound movement reflects a temporary pause in momentum as the market awaits a breakout in either direction. A decisive move above the \u20b997,500 resistance level could trigger a fresh wave of buying interest, paving the way for a rally towards the psychologically significant \u20b91,00,000 mark.Sustained strength beyond that could further extend gains toward \u20b91,05,000 in the near term, reinforcing the bullish outlook. On the other hand, if silver fails to break above resistance and instead slips below the \u20b995,300 support level, it may attract renewed selling pressure. In such a scenario, prices could decline sharply and potentially revisit the \u20b992,000 zone, where buyers might look to re-enter. Therefore, the current price band between \u20b995,300 and \u20b997,500 acts as a critical decision-making zone. Traders should remain alert and wait for a clear breakout or breakdown before initiating fresh positions. The direction of the next significant move in silver will largely depend on how prices behave around these levels.

            "text": "IPL franchises face disruption as international cricket schedules clash with the league's resumption. South Africa's directive to recall players for the WTC final by May 26th creates challenges, impacting teams like Gujarat Titans and Punjab Kings. England's ODI series against West Indies further complicates matters, potentially affecting teams like Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bengaluru. WTC Final, Eng-WI series leave franchises in a spot of bother with several foreign players in dilemma over return for IPL's resumptionThe latest Cricket South Africa (CSA) directive of recalling its IPL-bound players by May 26 has come as a body blow for the franchises, who will chase different goals upon the resumption of the league on Saturday. Making life more difficult for the teams is the impact that the England-West Indies ODI series, beginning May 29, could have on them as well.SA, slated to face Australia in the WTC final at Lord's in London from June 11, have reiterated their desire to bring the players back by the original deadline. \u201cOur initial agreement with the IPL and the BCCI was that our players would return on May 26. As it stands, we are not budging on this,\u201d SA coach Shukri Conrad said when asked about the extended IPL, which will run until June 3.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Eight players picked in SA's 15-member WTC final squad, including Ryan Rickelton (Mumbai Indians), Kagiso Rabada (Gujarat Titans) and Marco Jansen (Punjab Kings), are contracted to IPL teams. SA are set to land in England on May 31 and play a four-day practice match against Zimbabwe from June 3, meaning their players are unlikely to feature in the playoffs.Who's that IPL player?Meanwhile, Cricket Australia (CA) has put the ball in the players' court, saying the team management will come up with fresh preparation plans for players \u201cwho choose to play\u201d the rest of the IPL. Australia are scheduled to have a pre-final camp in Scotland from the end of this month, before travelling to England for the title clash. While Pat Cummins and Travis Head (both represent SRH who are eliminated) are likely to return, Josh Hazlewood (RCB) is set to give the final phase of IPL a miss. Should foreign players prioritize international matches over the IPL playoffs? The Englishmen who have been named in the contingent for the home assignment against the West Indies are expected to fly out of India before the IPL playoffs. Among those selected are Jos Buttler (Titans), Will Jacks (Mumbai) and Jacob Bethell (Royal Challengers), leaving their top-four chasing franchises with lastminute work to do.The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), like the CSA, had provided assurance that its centrallycontracted players would be available for the entire IPL, but has been left with no other option because of the revised schedule. There is no clarity on whether Sherfane Rutherford (GT) and Romario Shepherd (RCB), picked in the Windies ODI squad, will stay for the playoffs in case their teams make the cut. HOW TEAMS COULD BE AFFECTEDGUJARAT TITANSJos Buttler: The versatile wicketkeeper-batter will be badly missed as he has formed a nearperfect top-three with skipper Shubman Gill and B Sai Sudharsan. The top-order has done the bulk of the scoring for GT this campaign.Sherfane Rutherford: The West Indian lends firepower to the Titans middleorder packed with uncapped Indians. He has delivered some crucial cameos and for now, GT do not have a like-forlike replacement in the squad, given Glenn Phillips too is out with injury.Kagiso Rabada: GT have performed well even in the absence of the ace South African pacer. If he doesn't return, Gerald Coetzee, who is not part of SA WTC Final squad, can take his place.ROYAL CHALLENGERS BENGALURUJacob Bethell: The Englishman performed his duties after replacing the injured Phil Salt at the top of the order. With Salt expected to be back for the rest of the tournament \u2013 as mentioned by batting coach Dinesh Karthik \u2013 Bethell may not be much of a miss.Romario Shepherd: The all-rounder has been a regular in the XII since the time he came in for the out-of-form Liam Livingstone. The West Indian played a match-winning knock against CSK. He reached Bengaluru late on Wednesday, ending all speculation.Josh Hazlewood: Could be the biggest miss. The Australian pacer has spearheaded the attack and been one of the standout bowlers this season. RCB do not have a quality back-up who can match the calibre of Hazlewood and may have to rely on Nuwan Thushara.PUNJAB KINGSMarco Jansen: Another probable big blow. The South African all-rounder has been the best-performing overseas player for Punjab. He picked up his bowling form, especially with the new ball, as the tournament progressed. Fast bowler Xavier Bartlett can replace him if the lanky paceman doesn't return.Josh Inglis: The Australian wicketkeeper-batter has been a floater in the line-up, but has not made a significant contribution yet. With Prabhsimran Singh being a mainstay, PBKS do not have an headache in the wicketkeeping department.Marcus Stoinis: Though not part of the WTC Final squad, there is a chance he may not return. The Aussie has not lived up to the expectations, barring the knock against SRH where he smashed four successive sixes. Azmatullah Omarzai, who broke back into the XII recently, can replace him. Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years MUMBAI INDIANSRyan Rickelton: The southpaw has formed a formidable opening pair with Rohit Sharma and has been in fine nick. MI do not have an overseas replacement for him at the moment, neither do they have a wicketkeeper batter close to that quality.Will Jacks: While the Englishman has not set the IPL on fire, he has been a utility player. With MI lacking a genuine off-spinner, he has chipped in with some crucial overs.Corbin Bosch: The South African made it to the XII following the injury to leftarm spinner Mitchell Santner. Once Santner is back in the mix, Bosch may not be missed much.DELHI CAPITALSJake Fraser-McGurk: Though not part of WTC Final squad, opener has pulled out citing personal reasons. Poor returns from the Aussie opener meant that he was already dropped from the DC team with Faf du Plessis coming in place of him.Mitchell Starc: The left-arm pacer lost steam in recent matches and did not provide the cutting edge at the start or death. Following his pull-out, Bangladesh's Mustafizur Rahman has been drafted in and he can be a decent back-up.Tristan Stubbs: The South African has been a vital cog in the Capitals wheel, taking up one of the toughest jobs of finishing the innings. His probable absence can be a massive blow for DC.KOLKATA KNIGHT RIDERSThey will not be missing any overseas players due to clash of schedules.LUCKNOW SUPER GIANTSAiden Markram: The opener has been one of the top run-getters for LSG, who will need his services for all three remaining league matches if they are to keep faint playoff hopes alive. Super Giants have Matthew Breetzke, but he may not be able to match Markram's impact.* Sunrisers Hyderabad, Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings have already been eliminated from the IPL.

            "text": "Air Marshal Awadesh Kumar Bharti, hailing from Purnia, Bihar, played a crucial role in Operation Sindoor as the DG Air Operations, avenging the Pahalgam killings. Inspired by the establishment of a military airbase in his town after the 1962 war, he excelled in Sainik School and NDA, earning prestigious awards for his service. PATNA: No one would have thought that a decision to establish a military airbase at Chunapur in Purnia after the 1962 India-China war would give wings to the dream of a child in the town a few years later to fly jets and oversee a successful mission like Operation Sindoor against terrorists to avenge the killings of 26 tourists at Pahalgam.Air Marshal Awadesh Kumar Bharti, who as the DG Air Operations (DGAO) played a key role in the success of Operation Sindoor, is the man who nurtured that ambition while being a student of Middle School, Parora, 10 km away from Purnia town. He not only cracked the entrance exam of Sainik School Tilaiya, now in Jharkhand, but also of the National Defence Academy (NDA) and got commissioned into the fighter stream of the IAF in June 1987.A decorated officer, Air Marshal Bharti has been awarded Vayu Sena (VM) and Ati Vishisht Seva (AVSM) medals for his distinguished services.Bihar also has its reason to celebrate the country's military might, as defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, who kept a hawk's eye on the preparedness for the Operation Sindoor launched on May 7, hails from Muzaffarpur in the state and had his schooling from Netarhat School, now in Jharkhand. His commitment was reflected in his statement on assuming the charge of defence secretary last year when Rajesh said, \"The country will forever be indebted to our brave soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of the motherland. Their extraordinary courage and selflessness inspire us to work towards making India a safe and prosperous nation.\"The Bharti family is proud of the achievement of its members. The eldest among the three brothers and a sister born to Jiwachh Lal Yadav and Urmila Devi from Jhunni Kalan village in Purnia district, Air Marshal Bharti had that fire since childhood to serve the country by joining the armed forces, his brother Mithilesh Bharti told this newspaper over phone from Purnia on Wednesday. His youngest brother, Dr Rajesh Kumar Bharti, who is a noted medical practitioner, told TOI, \"My visionary grandfather had a dream to see his grandchild soar in the skies. My grandfather was a strict disciplinarian and used to recite stories from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata every evening. He would take Awadesh to all village fairs to make him aware about the rich heritage and roots and inculcated in him the Indian \u2018sanskars' and good virtues.\"He started his schooling from Purnia Convent. \"Our parents were living in Kosi Colony as dad was working in finance dept of Kosi Irrigation Project. He was a brilliant student. His teachers still remember him as one of the best students and my brother keeps visiting his school and interacts with the faculty and children when he visits Purnia. Then he went to the boarding school at Adarsh Madhya Vidyalaya, Parora and Sainik School, Tilaiya, followed by the NDA in Pune where he was the topper.He was awarded the prestigious \u2018Sword of Honour',\" Dr Bharti said.Reading, swimming, playing golf and walking are his few hobbies, Dr Bharti added.His father is proud of his son for what he is doing for the country. Air Marshal Bharti makes it a point every year to visit his home town in Srinagar Hata where his parents have been residing for the last 35 years. Mithilesh, who works for a pharmaceutical company, said, \"Whenever bhaiya visits Purnia, he meets people. He also visits the village home,\" he said. Earlier, Air Marshal Amit Dev of Sitamarhi and an alumnus of Patna's St Michael's High School, was the DGAO during the Balakot airstrikes following the Pulwama terror attack on the CRPF convoy in 2019.

Discussions revisited commitments from the 2022 Delhi Declaration and addressed threats from unmanned aerial systems and terrorist financing. The meeting occurred amidst heightened tensions and military actions between India and Pakistan after the attack. UN, India discuss counter-terrorism measures amid tensions with Pakistan after Pahalgam terror attack NEW DELHI: Indian delegation has ramped up efforts for United Nations listing of Lashkar-e-Taiba front The Resistance Front (TRF), according to news agency PTI, which cited sources. A team from India met United Nations under-secretary-general Vladimir Voronkov of the office of counter-terrorism (UNOCT) and assistant secretary-general Natalia Gherman of the counter-terrorism committee executive directorate (CTED) to discuss strengthening counter-terrorism cooperation. The meeting comes amid deteriorating relations between India and Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror attack, for which 'The Resistance Front' (TRF) had claimed responsibility. TRF is a front for the UN-proscribed Pakistani terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba. On the visit of the Indian Technical Team at UN in New York, a spokesperson told ANI, the meeting revisited commitments made under the 2022 Delhi Declaration, which was adopted by the counter-terrorism committee under India's chairmanship. They also discussed the development of non-binding guiding principles, crafted with CTED's support, to address threats from unmanned aerial systems and the exploitation of new financial technologies by terrorist networks.Voronkov and Gherman extended their condolences to the delegation over the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam. The terrorist attack prompted a sharp military escalation in the region.In response to the Pahalgam incident, the Indian Armed Forces launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. The operation led to the deaths of over 100 terrorists affiliated with Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), and Hizbul Mujahideen (HM).Pakistan retaliated with cross-border shelling and attempted drone strikes along the Line of Control. In a countermeasure, India launched coordinated attacks damaging radar systems, communication hubs, and airbases within Pakistani territory.The meeting in New York highlighted ongoing multilateral efforts to implement UN security council counter-terrorism resolutions and the UN global counter-terrorism strategy. Key areas of collaboration between India and the UN bodies include cybersecurity, countering terrorist travel, aiding victims of terrorism, and disrupting terror financing mechanisms.

            "text": "As the Cannes Film Festival attracts global attention, mastering the pronunciation of 'Cannes' as 'Kan' is crucial for fashion enthusiasts and film lovers. Correct pronunciation demonstrates cultural awareness and enhances one's presence in elite circles. Mispronouncing it can lead to social faux pas, especially in fashion-conscious environments. As the Cannes Film Festival attracts global attention, mastering the pronunciation of 'Cannes' as 'Kan' is crucial for fashion enthusiasts and film lovers. Correct pronunciation demonstrates cultural awareness and enhances one's presence in elite circles. Mispronouncing it can lead to social faux pas, especially in fashion-conscious environments. Every year, as the glamorous city of Cannes rolls out its iconic red carpet, the world turns its gaze to the French Riviera. Celebrities, designers, influencers, and cinephiles alike descend upon the Festival de Cannes, ready to celebrate cinema, couture, and cultural prestige. But before you dazzle in Dior or pose in Prada, there\u2019s one essential detail every fashionista and film lover must get right, how to pronounce Cannes. Let\u2019s clear the air: Cannes is pronounced \"Kan\", rhyming with \"can\". Not \"con\", not \"cans\", not \"kahns\". Just a crisp, elegant \"Kan\" - no frills, no fuss, and certainly no pronounced \u2018s\u2019. The word rolls off the tongue effortlessly, much like the silk gowns that sweep the Palais steps. French pronunciation often surprises non-native speakers. It\u2019s chic, sometimes subtle, and always stylish. The silent letters, nasal vowels, and lyrical flow all make the language what it is, an essential part of the allure of Cannes itself. Fashion is detail-oriented, and so is pronunciation. Just as mismatching your designer bag with your gown might raise eyebrows, mispronouncing Cannes is a social faux pas in circles where culture meets couture. Knowing how to say it correctly is the kind of insider knowledge that sets you apart in elite gatherings and fashion week conversations. Here\u2019s how to perfect your pronunciation:Sound it out: Say \u201ccan\u201d as in \u201cYes, I can!\u201dDrop the \u2018s\u2019: It\u2019s silent. Always.Keep it soft: No hard consonants or dramatic inflection.Once you have got it, repeat it a few times with flair. Pretend you\u2019re announcing your arrival at the Majestic Hotel: \u201cDarling, I have just arrived in Kan.\u201d The number of red-carpet hosts and influencers who\u2019ve fumbled the name over the years is countless. From misheard interviews to awkward red carpet moments, it happens more often than you\u2019d think. But there\u2019s no excuse for getting it wrong now. If you can pronounce Balenciaga and Maison Margiela correctly, you can handle Cannes.In fact, the incorrect pronunciation can lead to some unfortunate double meanings. For example, saying \u201ccon\u201d in a French accent could unintentionally sound like a not-so-polite French word. Not the glamorous impression one wants to leave at the Carlton Bar. Understanding how to pronounce Cannes is just the start. The Festival is a full-blown style spectacle and an education in European elegance. Everything, from the silhouette of a gown to the subtle nods to French couture history, is curated to perfection. Knowing the city\u2019s name is part of knowing its history. Cannes has been the host of the festival since 1946 and has long represented the epitome of French Riviera chic. Think Brigitte Bardot in the '60s, Princess Diana\u2019s unforgettable Chopard necklace moment, or Deepika Padukone\u2019s modern interpretations of saree silhouettes. Many red-carpet attendees rehearse their poses, designer tags, and press answers. But few rehearse pronunciation, which can be just as important when representing a brand or culture. Whether you're saying Cannes, Givenchy, or Croisette, being accurate adds authenticity to your presence. If you\u2019re ever unsure, here\u2019s a quick trick: Listen to how the French say it. Short, refined, and soft. Even a humble \"bonjour\" sounds like poetry. Let Cannes be your linguistic red carpet, understated but powerful. Fashion isn\u2019t just visual - it\u2019s cultural. It speaks in textiles, silhouettes, and, yes, even names. Pronouncing Cannes correctly may seem like a small detail, but in the world of fashion and film, details are everything.The next time you find yourself discussing a Maison\u2019s red carpet creation or reviewing the festival\u2019s best-dressed list, let your pronunciation reflect your sophistication. Say it with confidence, style, and a touch of savoir-faire.Because nothing says \"I belong\" quite like getting the basics beautifully right."

SUBSCRIBE NOW!Reflecting on Kohli\u2019s retirement note, Atherton said it was significant that Kohli acknowledged the unique challenges of Test cricket \u2014 a format he not only embraced but elevated with unmatched intensity. Who's that IPL player?Kohli\u2019s retirement leaves India facing a void at the crucial No. 4 position ahead of their five-Test series in England. \"You kind of pity the person who has to follow,\" Atherton remarked, noting the formidable legacy left behind by Kohli, much like his predecessor, Sachin Tendulkar. What will be Virat Kohli's biggest legacy in Test cricket? Nasser Hussain echoed similar sentiments, hailing Kohli as a transformative figure. \"I\u2019ve been a massive Virat Kohli fan over the last 14 years,\" Hussain said on the Sky Sports Cricket podcast. \"But he was so much more than just the stats \u2014 it was his aura, swagger, and passion. No one embodied the meaning of cricket in India more than Kohli.\"Under Kohli\u2019s leadership, India became the No. 1 Test side in the world, holding that position for a staggering 42 months. With 40 wins in 68 matches as captain, his aggressive style of leadership redefined India\u2019s image in Test cricket \u2014 fearless, fiery, and fit. Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years \"He is the ultimate winner,\" Hussain added. \"He can\u2019t go on the field and not be 100 per cent. Everything for Kohli is about winning. That\u2019s why he was so good in run chases and why India became such a formidable force.\"As Team India prepares for the next World Test Championship cycle, all eyes will be on who steps into Kohli\u2019s shoes. But for now, the cricket world stands united in celebrating a once-in-a-generation player who brought fire and flair to the longest format. 9 iconic monuments in India that tell the story of our past 10 offbeat destinations in India to escape the SUMMER heat and herds Arti Singh\u2019s glam looks in shimmer Tamil Nadu SSLC ResultRBSE ResultJAC 9th ResultJayson TatumNBA Trade RumourKerala LSS USS Scholarship ResultDwyane WadeIndus waters treaty suspensionShubhanshu ShuklaSilver Price PredectionBrain dead pregnant womanSSC GD ResultJosh AllenAli Khan MahmudabadVijay ShahMohammed Bin SalmanPakistan Nuclear ProgramIndia Pakistan NewsAnthony StolazIndia Pakistan CeasefireBaloch IndependenceBhopal TrafficAwantipora EncounterDraymond GreenLight No Fire Release DateIPL ScheduleIPL Points TableIPL Live ScoreIPL ResultsIPL Playoffs"

            "title": "Can SC fix deadlines for President, governors\u2019 assent to bills?: Murmu",
            "text": "President Murmu has sought the Supreme Court's opinion on the validity of its recent verdict that set deadlines for governors and the President to decide on state bills. Questioning the constitutional basis for such timelines, she invoked Article 143(1) to address concerns about the court's overreach and the concept of deemed assent, deeming it alien to the constitutional framework. NEW DELHI: In a sharp response to the April 8 verdict of Supreme Court, fixing deadlines for the governor and the President to decide on state Bills in the Tamil Nadu govt versus governor case, President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday asked the apex court how it could have given such a ruling when the Constitution had no such stipulations.Aware that a petition seeking review of the 415-page judgment by Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan would not yield positive outcome as it is ought be considered by the same bench in chamber, the Union govt invoked the President\u2019s rarely used powers under Article 143(1) of the Constitution to seek SC\u2019s opinion on a myriad contentious issues thrown up by the judgment, which it considers to be a clear overreach. Specifically, the President sought SC\u2019s view on 14 questions. Prez: Deemed assent concept alien to constitutional scheme The President said Articles 200 and 201, applicable to governors and President respectively, \u201cdoes not stipulate any time frame or procedure\u201d to be followed by them while considering grant or refusal of assent to a bill passed by an assembly.\u201cThe exercise of constitutional discretion by governor and the President under Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution, respectively, are essentially governed by polycentric considerations, including federalism, uniformity of laws, integrity and security of the nation, doctrine of separation of powers,\u201d she said, adding that she resorted to Article 143(1) in seeking the SC\u2019s opinion as the apex court has in the past delivered conflicting judgments on the justiciability of presidential assent to bills.Article 200 mandates the governor, on presentation of a bill passed by an assembly, to grant assent or \u201cas soon as possible\u201d return the bill, excluding Money bills, for reconsideration by the House. The provision also lays down that the governor \u201cshall not withhold assent\u201d when the bill, after having been reconsidered, is sent to him .However, when a governor reserves a bill for consideration of the President, she under Article 201 is mandated to declare whether she assents to the bill or withholds it. The Constitution, however, does not prescribe a timeframe for the President to take a particular action once the bill , after having been reconsidered by the assembly, is presented to her again for assent.Without any express provision in the Constitution, the bench of Justices Pardiwala and Mahadevan had set a three-month deadline for the governor to either grant or return the bill to the House.If the bill is re-passed by the House and resent to him, then the governor must grant assent within a month, SC had ruled. It had also fixed a three-month deadline for the President to decide whether to grant or refuse assent to a bill.Critical of the SC using its Article 142 powers to rule that the 10 bills pending with the Tamil Nadu governor would be deemed to have been assented to, the President said, \u201cThe concept of a deemed assent of the President and the governor is alien to the constitutional scheme and fundamentally circumscribes the powers of the President and the governor\u201d.The President also questioned the logic behind SC ruling that suggested that it would be better if the President seeks the opinion of the apex court in advance on whether to give assent to bills reserved for her by the governors.She said SC needs to give its opinion also contours and scope of provisions contained in Article 142 (which gives omnibus power to SC to do complete justice) \u201cin the context of issues (assent to bills) which are occupied by either constitutional provisions or statutory provisions.In addition, she questioned the states increasingly using writ jurisdiction of the SC under Article 32 (which is meant for remedying violations of fundamental rights of citizens) instead of Article 131 (Centre-state dispute to be adjudicated only by the SC) to adjudicate issues \u201cwhich by their nature are federal issues involving interpretation of the Constitution.\u201d Tamil Nadu SSLC ResultRBSE ResultJAC 9th ResultJayson TatumNBA Trade RumourKerala LSS USS Scholarship ResultDwyane WadeIndus waters treaty suspensionShubhanshu ShuklaSilver Price PredectionBrain dead pregnant womanSSC GD ResultJosh AllenAli Khan MahmudabadVijay ShahMohammed Bin SalmanPakistan Nuclear ProgramIndia Pakistan NewsAnthony StolazIndia Pakistan CeasefireBaloch IndependenceBhopal TrafficAwantipora EncounterBadar Khan SuriLight No Fire Release DateIPL ScheduleIPL Points TableIPL Live ScoreIPL ResultsIPL Playoffs TN SSLC HSE Plus ResultRBSE Board ResultKerala LSS USS ScholarshipJAC 9th ResultTips to Strengthen your MemoryTamil Nadu SSLC ResultCBSE Re Evaluation ProcessCBSE Unofficial vs Official WebsiteKCET ResultCUET UG Admit CardIND Tour ENGShashi TharoorIPL Overseas PlayersJEE Main Answer KeySSC GD ResultUS Visa FraudDonald TrumpRohit SharmaHyderabad FireSteam Account Data BreachElon MuskMicrosoft LayoffsGarena Free Fire MaxWordle TodayNYT Connections HintsDelhi AQIOperation BlackforestTinnu AnandLucknow Bus FirePurnam Kumar ShawAli Khan MahmudabadVijay Shah ControversyTelangana MonsoonBengaluru Techie SloganMumbai Metro Line 9 Phase 1Operation KellerIndia Pakistan NewsPune Pizza Outlet ProtestAK BhartiManipur EncounterBank Holidays MayEsports News Copyright \u00a9 2025 Bennett, Coleman & Co.

            "text": "The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has refuted claims of a radiation leak from any Pakistani nuclear facility, following reports that Indian missiles struck Kirana Hills during Operation Sindoor. This clarification counters widespread social media speculation and foreign media theories. The IAEA confirmed that, based on available information, no radiation release occurred. DEHRADUN: There was no radiation leak or release from any nuclear facility in Pakistan, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Wednesday (IST), rejecting widespread reports that claimed Indian missiles struck Kirana Hills in Pakistan\u2019s Sargodha during Operation Sindoor, triggering a radioactive incident.The clarification followed social media speculation and foreign media theories suggesting a nuclear stockpile in Pakistan had been hit during the airstrikes. Fredrik Dahl from IAEA\u2019s press department in an email response to TOI\u2019s query stated, \u201cWe are aware of the reports. Based on information available to the IAEA, there was no radiation leak or release from any nuclear facility in Pakistan.\u201dThe development came two days after Indian Air Force\u2019s director general air operations, Air Marshal A K Bharti, denied that India had targeted Kirana Hills or any nuclear installation in Pakistan. When asked by the media, Bharti said, \u201cThank you for telling us that Kirana Hills houses nuclear installations. We didn\u2019t know about it. We have not hit Kirana Hills and whatever is there.\u201dThe ministry of external affairs also rejected reports of a radiation leak. Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, during a press briefing on Tuesday, said, \u201cOur military action was entirely within the conventional domain. Some reports were suggesting that Pakistan\u2019s National Command Authority would convene a meeting, but those were later denied. In fact, Pakistan\u2019s govt representatives have officially denied this on record.\u201d IAEA\u2019s statement sought to dispel speculation that a radiation leak led to the ceasefire between India and Pakistan. Some foreign experts on global media platforms had amplified the theories, claiming the reports were accurate. The rumours intensified after some flight tracking platforms allegedly spotted a US department of energy aircraft\u2014used in nuclear emergencies like Fukushima\u2014near Pakistan.Another claim that an Egyptian military aircraft landed in Pakistan carrying boron, a chemical used to contain radioactive emissions, also circulated. Both these claims were unverified and dismissed by former military officials as baseless."

            "text": "Pakistan has appealed to India to reconsider its decision to keep the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, citing the dependence of millions on the regulated water. India, however, remains firm on its decision, taken in response to terrorist activities, asserting that changed circumstances and Pakistan's actions warrant a reevaluation of the treaty. Pak feeling the pinch ahead of sowing season NEW DELHI: Feeling the heat of India\u2019s decision to keep the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in abeyance, Pakistan has appealed to India to reconsider it citing the dependence of millions of people on the water being regulated by the 1960 treaty.The appeal is learnt to have been made in a letter by the secretary of Pakistan's ministry of water resources, Syed Ali Murtaza, to India\u2019s Jal Shakti ministry secretary Debashree Mukherjee. The tone of the letter is, however, not completely placatory, with Pakistan calling India's decision \u201cunilateral and illegal\u201d and \u201cequivalent to an attack on the people of Pakistan and its economy\u201d.Significantly, the letter, sources indicated, was likely to have been delivered during Operation Sindoor.New Delhi refrained from commenting on the \u201cappeal\u201d. However, sources said that it was not going to have any effect on the decision the cabinet committee on security took on April 23 to put the treaty on hold as a retaliation against the killing of tourists in Pahalgam. When asked, sources in the govt referred to PM Modi\u2019s \u201cblood and water cannot flow together\u201d assertion in his address to the nation on Monday. Do you think the Indus Waters Treaty needs to be renegotiated? On its part, India has rejected the charge that the decision to keep the treaty in suspension was \u201cillegal\u201d.Pak facing pinch of irregular flow ahead of sowing seasonSources said the treaty does provide for a reconsideration because of the change of circumstances and the threshold has been reached due to Pakistan using terrorism as a tool to hurt India.\u201cThe treaty was negotiated in a spirit of goodwill and good neighbourliness. That is why we persisted with it despite the fact that it was flawed and loaded against India. However, Pakistan\u2019s refusal to rein in the terrorists has knocked the very premise underpinning the treaty,\u201d said a senior source.Moreover, climate change and other ground realities also require a relook at the design of the dams and other infrastructure that are in place, and this also fulfils the criteria of \u201cchange of circumstances\u201d in the treat, highly placed sources said, signalling India\u2019s resolve not to reconsider.India in the past few days had undertaken flushing and desilting of reservoirs of two run-of-the-river hydropower projects \u2014 Baglihar and Salal \u2014 on the Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir, resulting in the obstruction and irregularity of water flow downstream.Since India after suspending the treaty is not under any obligation to share any data with Pakistan on water flow after flushing or opening of gates, the neighbouring country has been facing the pinch of irregular flow ahead of the upcoming sowing season. 9 iconic monuments in India that tell the story of our past 10 offbeat destinations in India to escape the SUMMER heat and herds Tamil Nadu SSLC ResultRBSE ResultJAC 9th ResultNFL Schedule 2025NBA Trade RumourKerala LSS USS Scholarship ResultDwyane WadeIndus waters treaty suspensionShubhanshu ShuklaSilver Price PredectionBrain dead pregnant womanHP Board Class 10th ResultHBSE Class 10th ResultAli Khan MahmudabadVijay ShahBareilly Women MarriagePakistan Nuclear ProgramIndia Pakistan NewsAuston MatthewsMichael RubinBaloch IndependenceBhopal TrafficAwantipora EncounterBadar Khan SuriLight No Fire Release DateIPL ScheduleIPL Points TableIPL Live ScoreIPL ResultsIPL Playoffs Backlash for support to Pakistan: Indians cancel trips to Turkey, Azerbaijan; travel ports report big dipSundari actor Jishnu Menon gets married to beau AbiyathiraBuffalo Bills use AI to release their 2025 NFL ScheduleMarvel Rivals May 15 update patch notes (version 20250515) - Free costume coin reward, S0 Battle Pass, hero bug fixes, and moreUK teen, who disappeared in Thailand, resurfaces in handcuffs in Georgia over drug smuggling chargesAs Trump eyes Greenland, Iceland reconsiders its ties with USLike a Dragon is coming to Roblox with the GeekOut\u2019s official licensed project with Sega\u2018Qawwali is more than music; it\u2019s a universal expression of devotion that unites people\u2019\u2018As thick we are as family, we don\u2019t indulge as one while making a film\u2019The guest list from Diddy\u2019s infamous \u2018freak off\u2019 parties may soon be revealed; read to find out who all may be involvedWhy the Indian housewife is the smartest fund manager in the world'I need ...': Prithvi Shaw shares cryptic post ahead of IPL resumptionLittle tummies, big warnings: Belly fat in kids may predict heart trouble by 10Tovino drops second single \u2018Aadu Ponmayile\u2019 from Narivetta\u2019; Netizens say, \u201cJakes Bejoy has a special talent to present folk style\u201d'Bridgerton' season 4 clip teases Benedict and Sophie's FIRST MEET ahead of 2026 release; seasons 5 and season 6 confirmed - WATCHSupreme Court to consider question of interim relief in pleas challenging validity of amended Waqf law on May 20Microsoft's second biggest job cuts: Coders, managers, and others who are being asked to leaveGold rate today: Gold prices down Rs 7,900 per 10 grams from record highs"

            "text": "Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's Cannes Film Festival appearances are always a highlight, especially her bold fashion choices. In 2016, her purple lipstick became a viral sensation, sparking both praise and criticism. Amitabh Bachchan defended her look, emphasizing social media's role in self-expression and the fleeting nature of trends. Now, as Cannes 2025 begins, fans eagerly anticipate Aishwarya's next iconic moment. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and the Cannes Film Festival go hand in hand. For years, she\u2019s been gracing the red carpet with her iconic style, giving fans some truly unforgettable fashion moments. As the Cannes Film Festival 2025 kicks off, let\u2019s go back to one of her boldest and most talked-about looks ever, when she wore that purple lipstick in 2016.The purple lipstick that went viralIn 2016, the 'Jodhaa Akbar' actress showed up at the Cannes red carpet looking stunning as always. But it wasn\u2019t her gown that stole the show, it was her bright purple lipstick. She kept the rest of her look simple, wearing no other jewellery except two diamond earrings.Within minutes, her lipstick shade became a hot topic on social media. Some praised it, some turned it into memes, and others called it a \u2018fashion blunder\u2019. It didn\u2019t matter whether people loved or hated it, everyone was talking about it. Aishwarya\u2019s purple lips became the internet\u2019s obsession. Amitabh Bachchan\u2019s classy takeSoon after the purple lipstick moment blew up online, Aishwarya\u2019s father-in-law and Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan, was asked about it. Speaking to DNA, Big B gave a graceful and thoughtful response.He said, \"What is wrong with that? Social media gives someone the opportunity to express themselves. You\u2019ve never had that opportunity before, you never knew what others were thinking about you, at least now you know. And the good part is, it lasts for a day or half-a-day; the next day, something else comes up.\u201dHe pointed out that in today\u2019s fast-moving world, attention spans are short and trends fade quickly. According to him, social media simply allows people to say what they feel \u2014 and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.Amitabh added, \"Things move so rapidly in today\u2019s life that you don\u2019t have time. One\u2019s attention span is so limited and so small. Whether it is watching the news on TV, every two minutes you hear a bang in the middle of the most sincere news, purely because they don\u2019t want you to get to your remote and change the channel. That\u2019s how life has become. Social media gives everybody a voice, everybody an opportunity, everybody a democratic opportunity to express themselves. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201dWhat started as online trolling eventually turned into a major beauty trend. Over time, many fans and social media content creators tried out bold lip colours inspired by Aishwarya\u2019s look. All eyes on Cannes 2025As Cannes 2025 kicks off, fans are once again looking forward to seeing what Aishwarya Rai Bachchan will wear. Will she play it safe? Or will she serve another headline-making look? One thing\u2019s for sure, whether it\u2019s purple lipstick or something completely unexpected, Aishwarya knows how to own it.

            "text": "Donald Trump's renewed interest in mediating between India and Pakistan coincides with a recent deal between Pakistan's Crypto Council and World Liberty Financial (WLF), a cryptocurrency venture with Trump family ties. This partnership, involving figures like Zachary Witkoff, raises questions about potential connections between the crypto deal and Trump's shift in stance on the Indo-Pak conflict. NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to be a broker in the conflict between India and Pakistan has the spotlight on a deal the hostile neighbour recently negotiated with World Liberty Financial (WLF), a cryptocurrency venture in which the president\u2019s family has 60% stake.The deal was signed between WLF and the hastily-launched Pakistan Crypto Council, which early last month appointed as its adviser Changzpeng Zhao (CZ) \u2014 founder of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance \u2014 with the ambitious objective of making Islamabad South Asia\u2019s crypto capital.Though the Crypto Council was barely a month old, WLF sent its heavy guns, including Zachary Witkoff, son of Trump\u2019s golf buddy Steve, to Islamabad where they were feted by Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif, and more crucially, army chief General Asim Munir, who just days later \u201ccleared\u201d the mass killing in Pahalgam of tourists who were segregated on the basis of their faith. WLF\u2019s stakeholders include Trump\u2019s two sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr, who, along with their brother-in law Jared Kushner, have been scouring different parts of the world for lucrative business deals and have attracted allegations of leveraging their links to the White House.Witkoff, who, like Trump, is a real estate billionaire focused on New York, is seen as the \u201cman-to-go\u201d in Washington DC. A regular at Mar a Lago, Trump\u2019s golf resort in Florida, Witkoff attracted global attention when he got Israel and the UAE and Bahrain to sign Abraham Accords during the incumbent US President's first term.

The mission, carried by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, will include astronauts from India, Poland, and Hungary, marking a return to human spaceflight for each nation after over four decades. Ax-4, piloted by Shubhanshu Shukla, has a research complement of around 60 scientific studies. BENGALURU: Axiom Space late Wednesday said that the launch of its Axiom-4 mission (Ax-4) to the International Space Station (ISS), which will be piloted by India\u2019s Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, will be scheduled for 9.11am (Eastern Time) \u2014 around 6.40pm IST, on June 8. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will launch the Ax-4 crew aboard a Dragon spacecraft to the ISS from Launch Complex 39A at Nasa\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. TOI had reported last week that the mission, which was initially scheduled for May 29, was expected to be pushed to early June. Axiom, Nasa and SpaceX are now expected to provide a mission overview early next week. As part of Ax-4 mission, for the first time in history, astronauts from India, Poland, and Hungary will fly together to the ISS as part of a government-sponsored mission \u2014 with each nation returning to human spaceflight after more than four decades. India is spending around Rs 548 crore on the mission.Aside from Shukla, the Ax-4 crewmembers are Commander Peggy Whitson of the US, mission specialists S\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski of Poland and Tibor Kapu of Hungary.

Indigenous air defence network played a crucial role during the hostilities. The armed forces are on high alert, maintaining operational readiness. India is adhering to the bilateral understanding to cease military action. India demonstrated tech edge by outsmarting Pak\u2019s Chinese systems NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday asserted it circumvented Pakistan\u2019s air defence (AD) systems of Chinese-origin to carry out the strikes against the nine terror hubs without crossing the border on May 7, and then thwarted multiple retaliatory missile and drone attacks using a robust indigenous AD network during intense hostilities last week.\u201cThe IAF bypassed and jammed Pakistan\u2019s Chinese-supplied air defence systems (like the HQ-9 missile batteries and radars), completing the mission in just 23 minutes on May 7, demonstrating India\u2019s technological edge,\u201d a new govt statement said.Despite Pakistan\u2019s attempts to \u201cexploit advanced foreign supplied weaponry\u201d, ranging from Chinese-made PL-15 LR beyond visual range air-to-air missiles to Turkish-origin Byker Yiha kamikaze drones and Asisguard Songar drones, India\u2019s AD and electronic warfare networks \u201cremained superior\u201d, it added.With PM Narendra Modi having drawn new red lines against Pakistan-backed terrorism, the Indian armed forces are currently on a hot standby, maintaining full operational readiness to foil any misadventure. \u201cWe are strictly adhering to the May 10 bilateral understanding to cease all cross-border military action. But Pak Army chief General Asim Munir can never be trusted,\u201d a senior military officer told TOI. When military hostilities were fully underway for four days last week, the IAF\u2019s fully-automated integrated air command and control system (IACCS) played a critical role during Operation Sindoor. It connects different radars to a wide array of AD weapon systems as well as the Army\u2019s smaller Akashteer system to present a composite real-time air situation picture.The Army quickly deployed six mobile Akashteer nodes, which it had begun to induct just a few months ago under a Rs 1,982 crore inked with defence PSU Bharat Electronic (BEL) in March 2023, from J&K to Rajasthan, officials told TOI.\u201cGround-based defence systems integrated with Akashteer made it hell for Pakistan\u2019s air adventures. The system performed beyond users' expectations, providing robust air defence to India during the current conflict,\u201d BEL said in a post on `X\u2019 on Wednesday.The major weapon systems plugged into the AD network included the long-range Russian S-400 `Triumf\u2019 surface-to-air missile systems (380-km interception range), Barak-8 medium range SAM systems (70-km), jointly developed with Israel, and the indigenous Akash systems (25-km). Then, there were Pechora missiles, L-70 low-level anti-aircraft guns, shoulder-fired Igla-S missiles (6-km) and the integrated drone detection and interdiction systems (1-2 km).\u201cThis multi-tier defence prevented Pakistan Air Force\u2019s attacks on our airfields and logistic installations during the night of May 9 and 10. It played a crucial role in ensuring that both civilian and military infrastructure across India remains largely unaffected during the enemy\u2019s retaliation attempts,\u201d the govt statement said. It added that at least 10 satellites also continuously worked round-the-clock, quoting ISRO chairman V Narayanan.Before the truce, India launched offensive actions with surgical precision against nine airbases in Pakistan and PoK as well as some radar sites, including the Nur Khan, Rahimyar Khan and Sargodha airbases, which included the use of BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles and other stand-off weapons.\u201cAll these strikes were executed without loss of Indian assets, underscoring the effectiveness of our surveillance, planning and delivery systems. The use of modern indigenous technology, from long-range drones to guided munitions made these strikes highly effective and politically calibrated,\u201d the statement said.Operation Sindoor is not just a story of tactical success, but also a validation of India\u2019s defence indigenization policies. From air defence systems to drones, from counter-UAS capabilities to net-centric warfare platforms, indigenous technology has delivered where it mattered, it said.\u201cOperation Sindoor emerged as a calibrated military response to an evolving pattern of asymmetric warfare, one that increasingly targets unarmed civilians along with military personnel. India is ready, armed with its own innovations, backed by a determined state, and powered by the ingenuity of its own people,\u201d it added.

Ajay Devgn\u2019s gripping crime drama 'Raid 2' may have slowed a little in its second week, but it\u2019s still holding strong at the box office. With a powerful storyline and solid performances by Devgn, Riteish Deshmukh and Vaani Kapoor, the film has managed to stay in the spotlight even without any major new competition. Now, with a global total of over Rs 174 crore, 'Raid 2' is inching closer to beating Salman Khan\u2019s 'Sikandar' at the worldwide box office.Raid 2 Movie ReviewA solid start and steady growthDirected by Raj Kumar Gupta, 'Raid 2' follows Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax Amay Patnaik as he takes on a powerful and corrupt enemy, played by Riteish Deshmukh. The sequel builds on the success of the 2018 hit 'Raid', but this time the stakes are even higher. Vaani Kapoor plays the emotional backbone of the story, portraying Patnaik\u2019s supportive wife. Day 14 Box Office: A slight dip, but still going strongOn Day 14 (Wednesday), 'Raid 2' saw a slight dip in its daily earnings, collecting Rs 3.35 crore, as per early estimates by Sacnilk. This brings its India net total to a strong Rs 133.45 crore. While this is lower than its earlier weekday numbers, it still shows steady interest from moviegoers. With no major new releases to compete with, the film continues to draw in viewers, especially in cities. The occupancy rate in theatres was decent across the day, with morning shows at 4.99%, afternoon at 10.50%, evening at 10.58%, and night shows climbing to 15.15%. Strong worldwide performance: Nearing 'Sikandar'Apart from doing well in India, 'Raid 2' has also made a solid mark overseas. According to Sacnilk, on Day 13 (Tuesday), the film collected Rs 10 lakhs from international markets, bringing the overseas total to Rs 19.60 crore. Adding this to its domestic success, 'Raid 2' has now reached a massive worldwide total of Rs 174.25 crore.This puts the film in a strong position to soon overtake Salman Khan\u2019s 'Sikandar', which earned Rs 184.6 crore globally. The big question now is whether 'Raid 2' can hold on through the third weekend and finally beat that number.Can 'Raid 2' enter the Rs 150 crore club in India?With the India net collection now at Rs 133.45 crore, 'Raid 2' is not far from reaching the Rs 150 crore mark. All eyes are now on its third weekend performance. If it continues to hold well, especially on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, the film could hit another big milestone."

NEW DELHI: Flagging concerns over the misuse of a Central Goods and Services Tax Act provision, Delhi high court has fined a private firm for fraudulently claiming input tax credit (ITC) to escape paying full GST.\u201cThis court takes note, with some consternation, that such large-scale fraudulent availment of ITC may, if left unchecked, lead to severe damage to the GST framework itself,\u201d HC said.Fake invoices leading to GST credit facility misuse: HCThe GST framework is meant to encourage legally entitled persons and businesses to avail of ITC and other similar facilities, said a bench of Justices Prathiba M Singh and Rajneesh Kumar Gupta in a recent order. HC noted Section 16 of CGST Act was being misused by companies and traders who first availed of the ITC by issuing fake invoices and, when slapped with a penalty by the department, rushed to court in writ jurisdiction.In essence, ITC allows a tax entity or person to claim credit & deduct from payable GST on purchase of goods and/or services used in the chain of business transaction, as it has been taxed earlier. However, court noted that due to fake invoices leading to fraudulent claims by persons, the facility is being misused, along with writ jurisdiction of the court.\u201cThis court... is exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution and when there is an allegation of such large-scale fraud, to the tune of more than Rs 56.2 crore, being committed with the involvement of a total of 527 firms including the petitioner firm, the court has to be circumspect in the exercise of its powers,\u201d HC noted while imposing costs on the private entity after it emerged fake invoices were created to escape GST liability."

Simultaneously, a Wisconsin judge was indicted for allegedly aiding an undocumented immigrant, while another judge cleared the way for deporting a Venezuelan man under the Alien Enemies Act, requiring due process. A federal judge on Wednesday ordered that a Georgetown scholar from India be released from immigration detention after he was detained in the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on foreign college students. Badar Khan Suri, who is being held in Texas, will go home to his family in Virginia while he awaits the outcome of his petition against the Trump administration for wrongful arrest and detention in violation of the First Amendment and other constitutional rights. He\u2019s also facing deportation proceedings in an immigration court in Texas. Before ordering his release, district judge Patricia Tolliver Giles in Alexandria said she was releasing him because she felt Suri had substantial constitutional claims against the Trump administration. She also considered the needs of his family and said she didn\u2019t believe he was a danger to the community. The Trump govt had said his visa was revoked because of his online posts and his wife\u2019s connection to Gaza as a Palestinian American. They accused him of supporting Hamas. Mapheze Saleh, Suri\u2019s wife, is the daughter of Ahmed Yousef, a former adviser to Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas member whom Israel assassinated last year in Iran. \u201cSpeech regarding the conflict there and opposing Israel\u2019s military campaign is likely protected political speech,\u201d Giles said. \u201cAnd thus he was likely engaging in protected speech.\u201d She added: \u201cThe First Amendment does not distinguish between citizens and noncitizens\u201d Suri was arrested by masked, plain-clothed officers on the evening of March 17 outside his apartment complex in Virginia. By the time a petition had been filed to keep his case in Virginia, authorities had put him on a plane to Louisiana without allowing him to update his family or lawyer, Suri\u2019s attorneys said. A few days later, he was moved again to Texas. Before Wednesday\u2019s hearing, US attorneys argued that Suri\u2019s case should be moved from Virginia to Texas because the petition was filed after the scholar had already left the state. They said filing his case in Texas is a \u201crelatively straightforward application of wellsettled law\u201d. Giles agreed with Suri\u2019s attorneys from American Civil Liberties Union, who argued that it had appeared the real reason he was moved to Texas was to bring the case before a more conservative court. Khan Suricame to the US in 2022 through a J-1 visa, working at Georgetown as a visiting scholar and postdoctoral fellow. He has three children: a 9-yearold son and 5-year-old twins. Before his arrest, he taught a course on majority and minority human rights in South Asia. Court filings said he hoped to become a professor and embark on a career in academia. Judge indicted for \u2018shielding migrant\u2019A federal grand jury indicted a Wisconsin judge on charges she helped a man in the country illegally evade US immigration authorities looking to arrest him as he appeared before her in a local domestic abuse case. Milwaukee county circuit judge Hannah Dugan\u2019s arrest and ensuing indictment has escalated a clash between Trump govt and local authorities over the Republican president\u2019s sweeping immigration crackdown.Dugan faces up to six years in prison if convicted. Her team of defence attorneys said that she maintains her innocence and looks forward to being vindicated in court. Dugan is scheduled to enter a plea on Thursday.Judge backs wartime law for deportationA federal judge on Tuesday opened a path for Trump govt to move forward with deporting a Venezuelan man under Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law, but ruled it must first give him notice in his native language, 21 days to object and an \u201copportunity to be heard\u201d in court. The ruling, by judge Stephanie L Haines from the western district of Pennsylvania, could provide a legal opening for govt to restart deportations under the Act of Venezuelans whom it considers members of Tren de Aragua, a gang that the White House has designated as a terrorist organisation.The American Civil Liberties Unionsaid it would appeal Haines\u2019 decision.(With inputs from NYT)"

            "text": "A recent study presented at the European Congress on Obesity reveals that individuals using weight loss drugs, including newer GLP-1 medications, tend to regain all lost weight within a year of discontinuing the medication. While these drugs effectively induce weight loss, maintaining a healthy lifestyle through diet and exercise remains crucial for long-term success. While the use of drugs for weight loss continues to fuel debates, one latest finding has added more concerns to their long term use.As per a study presented at the European Congress on Obesity, those on weight loss drugs regain all the weight they have lost within a year after they stop taking the medication.\"Analysis of 11 studies of older and newer GLP-1 weight loss drugs by the University of Oxford found that patients typically lost 8kg on weight loss jabs but returned to their original weight within 10 months of stopping them,\" The Guardian reported. Do you believe weight loss drugs are a sustainable solution for long-term weight management? \"While those taking semaglutide (Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro) lost double the amount of weight compared with people using older jabs \u2013 16kg on average \u2013 patients put on 9.6kg within a year, meaning they could expect to regain all 16kg again in just over 20 months,\" the report added.\u201cThese drugs are very effective at helping you lose weight, but when you stop them, weight regain is much faster than [after stopping] diets,\u201d Susan Jebb, the co-author of the study and professor of diet and population health at University of Oxford told the media.While the study didn\u2019t establish a cause-and-effect relationship, the researchers say that the difference in how quickly people regain weight might stem from the nature of dieting itself. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone if people regain weight having used GLP-1 drugs without seriously attempting to improve their lifestyle \u2026 Using GLP-1 is not the quick fix which many users believe it to be,\" Tam Fry, the chair of the National Obesity Forum told the media.Weight loss drugs like Wegovy, Ozempic, and Mounjaro are the new buzz in town. Celebs are flaunting their transformations, social media\u2019s obsessed, and suddenly everyone\u2019s talking about \u201cmiracle\u201d injections that melt the pounds away. Sounds like a dream, right?But here\u2019s the catch: quick fixes don\u2019t always last.Yes, these drugs do work. They help regulate appetite, reduce cravings, and kickstart weight loss\u2014especially for those struggling with obesity or related health issues. For many, they\u2019re a genuine game-changer. But the truth no one\u2019s hyping up? Most people gain the weight back once they stop taking the meds.That\u2019s because weight loss isn\u2019t just about appetite. It\u2019s about long-term habits, mental health, sleep, stress, hormones, and, of course, what\u2019s on your plate and how often you move.Here\u2019s the thing: no drug can teach you how to meal prep, drink more water, or stay consistent with your workouts. No shot replaces a good night\u2019s sleep, stress management, or a solid support system. These are the boring basics\u2014but they\u2019re what really keep the weight off in the long run.Plus, let\u2019s not forget the side effects. Nausea, fatigue, digestive issues\u2014weight loss meds aren\u2019t all sunshine. And they\u2019re expensive too. Not everyone can afford to be on them forever, and when people stop, many find themselves back at square one.So what\u2019s the real solution? Start where it matters\u2014your lifestyle. Build sustainable habits. Focus on why you eat, not just what you eat. Get moving in a way that feels good, not punishing. And most importantly, be patient with yourself. Real, lasting change doesn\u2019t happen overnight.Weight loss drugs can be a helpful tool, especially for those with medical conditions, but they\u2019re not a magic solution. Think of them as a push, not a plan.So sure, ride the trend if it\u2019s right for you\u2014but don\u2019t ditch the fundamentals. Because at the end of the day, it\u2019s not just about losing weight\u2014it\u2019s about gaining a healthier life.

The police said the accused, K. Balu, a native of Pudukudoiyanur village near Sholinghur town, had been cultivating paddy on his three-acre farmland in the village for many years. The initial inquiry revealed that Balu got married to B. Bhuvaneshwari, 26, a resident in Walajah town, in 2021, and the couple has a three-year-old son. Balu often came home drunk, and the couple would argue over domestic issues, said the police. Unable to put up with his drunken behaviour, Bhuvaneshwari and her son left home to stay with her mother V. Bharathi, 56, near Walajah town, a year ago. On Wednesday (May 14, 2025) night, Balu went to his mother in-law\u2019s house and quarrelled with his wife. According to the police, in a fit of rage, Balu killed his mother in-law, who was trying to pacify the couple. Fearing for her life, Bhuvaneshwari fled the spot. The couple\u2019s son was not home at the time. Balu then went to the house of a relative whom he suspected his wife was in a relationship with, in Kodakkal village near Sholinghur town, and inquired about the man\u2019s whereabouts. Only his parents, C. Annamalai, 52, and A. Rajeshwari, 45, were home. When they refused to provide the information he asked for, Balu attacked them with a steel rod, killing them, the police said. Based on an alert from the couple\u2019s neighbours, the Walajah police rushed to the spot and nabbed Balu from his hideout. A case was registered. The police said Balu sustained a fracture to his leg when he was being taken to the scene of the crime. He was admitted to Government Taluk Hospital in Walajah. A probe is under way."

A summer vacation Bench of Justices G.R. Swaminathan and V. Lakshminarayanan directed advocate Vijayan Subramanian to obtain instructions from the producers by Thursday, as the movie was slated to be released in theatres on Friday (May 16, 2025). To get today\u2019s top stories from the State in your inbox, subscribe to our Tamil Nadu Today newsletter The time was granted during the hearing of a public interest litigation (PIL) petition, which sought a direction to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) to revoke the censor certificate until the producers delete the song \u2018Kissa 47\u2019, which reportedly had objectionable references to the phrase \u2018Govinda, Govinda.\u2019 Later in the day, Mr. Subramanian returned to state that the producers had decided to mute the objectionable tune and delete certain lyrics. After recording his submissions, the judge adjourned the hearing to Friday for senior counsel Sricharan Rangarajan, representing the PIL petitioner, to verify the statement. In his affidavit, the petitioner, M.G.D. Balaji, 49, an advocate from Old Washermanpet in Chennai, stated that he is a devout Hindu and a follower of the Vaishnava tradition. He said he recently came across a YouTube video of a press meet for actor Santhanam\u2019s upcoming movie, popularly known as DD Next Level, which is scheduled to be released in theatres on Friday. Subsequently, he heard one of the songs of the movie and found that the lyrics had been borrowed from a popular devotional hymn titled \u2018Srinivasa Govinda, Srivenkatesa Govinda\u2019, sung in praise of Lord Venkateswara, the presiding deity of the Tirumala Tirupati Temple. He complained that the tune of the hymn had been used in a \u201cvery strange and inappropriate context\u201d in the song. Stating it had hurt his religious feelings, the petitioner said, the word \u2018Govinda\u2019 too had been used in a demeaning manner in the song. He also expressed surprise over the CBFC having issued a U/A certificate for the movie without insisting on deleting the song with such objectionable references.

            "text": "Iran has shown interest in learning cheetah management from India. File | Photo Credit: PTI Iran, working to save its rapidly declining cheetah population, has shown interest in learning cheetah management from India, according to information received through an RTI application. Rajesh Gopal, chairman of the government's Cheetah Project Steering Committee, shared this information during a meeting of the panel in February. Two cheetahs move to new home in Madhya Pradesh \"In a recent meeting, Iranian officials have expressed their interest in learning cheetah management in India,\" the minutes of the meeting quoted Mr. Gopal as saying. He also suggested that the International Big Cat Alliance, an India-led initiative, could reach out to other cheetah range countries interested in learning about cheetah conservation and management. However, when asked if Iran had formally approached India in this regard, a senior official of the National Tiger Conservation Authority said, \"there is no such proposal at this juncture.\" The government's \"Action Plan for Introduction of Cheetahs in India\" also mentions that India would be willing to assist Iran and the global conservation community in efforts to protect the critically endangered Iranian cheetah. The cheetah is the only large carnivore that became extinct in India, primarily owing to over-hunting and habitat loss. The last known cheetah in the country died in 1948 in the Sal forests of Chhattisgarh's Koriya district. Madhya Pradesh CM releases five more cheetahs into the wild in Kuno India began discussions with the Shah of Iran in the 1970s to bring the Asiatic cheetah to India in exchange for Asiatic lions. However, considering the small population of Asiatic cheetahs in Iran and the genetic similarity between the Iranian and African cheetahs, it was later decided to use the African species for reintroduction. Since September 2022, India has translocated 20 African cheetahs \u2014 eight from Namibia and 12 from South Africa \u2014 as part of its globally watched reintroduction programme. It is now set to receive eight more cheetahs from Botswana in two phases, with the first four expected by May this year. Cheetah gives birth to five cubs at Kuno National Park Once found across central and southwest Asia, the Asiatic cheetah now survives only in Iran. Experts estimate fewer than 30 remain in the wild. In January 2022, an Iranian Minister told state media that the population had dropped to just 12 from around 100 in 2010. According to researchers at the Tehran-based conservation NGO Iranian Cheetah Society (ICS), up to 400 Asiatic cheetahs roamed a large area of eastern and central Iran in the mid-1970s. Despite receiving legal protection in the 1960s, the cheetahs in Iran have continued to face threats owing to a decline in their primary prey species, habitat loss and fragmentation, human-wildlife conflict, especially after the Iranian revolution of 1979 and the Iran-Iraq war. Researchers say most of the remaining cheetah habitats in Iran are also rich in mineral resources while international sanctions on Iran have caused economic hardships, pushing some people towards illegal and unregulated hunting of prey animals."

Indus Waters Treaty to be kept in abeyance as Pakistan resorted to cross-border terror: source India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs declined comment. The Hindu has written to Mr Murtaza but hasn\u2019t received a comment. Per the IWT, both India and Pakistan have Indus Commissioners who lead delegations for talks regarding water-sharing aspects governing the Treaty which has been in force since 1960. India had however said, last September, that no more meetings of the Permanent Indus Commission (PIC) would be held till the governments of India and Pakistan meet and discuss the renegotiation of the IWT. The last meeting reportedly happened in Delhi in May 2022. Since January 2023, India has written four times to Pakistan to initiate talks on revising the treaty but, according to sources, not received a \u201csatisfactory response.\u201d \u201cIndia\u2019s position is that re-negotiation of the treaty could be done only government-government and not by Indus Commission representatives. Pakistan offered to meet at a neutral venue but we proposed that we meet in Islamabad. Following this there was a silence for 4-5 months and now they have sent us this letter,\u201d a person, familiar with the contents of Mr. Murtaza\u2019s latest letter, told The Hindu.

Its prominent hydropower projects on these rivers, such as the Kishenganga and Baglihar projects, are run-of-the-river, meaning they divert the river\u2019s flow to generate electricity. These projects do not halt the flow by creating storage structures, though in nearly all the disputes over the years regarding hydel projects, Pakistan has accused India of modifying the design of structures to be able to perniciously control the flow of the rivers.

Senior advocate Mihir Desai, along with advocates Lara Jesani and Rishika Agarwal for the petitioners had pressed for implementation of Supreme Court\u2019s 2018 Shakti Vahini guidelines which provides safe house and protection to the couple, but these guidelines were not implemented in Maharashtra. Fencing out interfaith relationships in the new India On October 27, 2023, the Bombay High Court had directed the State Government to consider issuing a GR. On April 29, 2025, the Bombay High Court received a draft of the GR that said the State government would be dealing with safe house for inter-faith and inter-caste couples, both married and unmarried. \u201cWe have gone through the said draft GR. Learned counsel for the Petitioner has also gone through the same. Since it covers almost every aspect, it is open for the State Government to issue GR in terms of the said draft GR within two weeks from today,\u201d the court said. The GR says that a special district-level cell, led by the superintendent of police or commissioner as chairman of the cell in which district social welfare officer will be a member and district women and child development officer will be a member secretary. The cell shall take due cognizance of all types of complaints from the couples and shall take immediate action to protect them. The cell will be equipped to provide security and a safe house for couples in danger. The SOP encompasses a helpline, FIR registration procedures, free legal assistance, a district review committee, and mandated reporting to the government. Couples must submit a self-declaration of voluntary marriage and age verification. If the police finds that either of the couple is a minor, they should check whether he or she has voluntarily joined each other or whether a case of missing or kidnapping or adoption has been registered against the minor. If the minors are involved, the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) will be notified for protection. Complaints can be made confidentially via helpline 112, with immediate police response guaranteed for threats to life. If the minor is above 16 but below 18 years, his or her views shall be taken into consideration. Additionally, quarterly reports will be submitted to the state government by the director-general of police. The State or the District Family Services Authority shall provide free legal aid to the couples and if required, the couples should also be provided with counselling and marriage registration services to the adult couples. marriage / social issues (general) / religion and belief / laws / Maharashtra Stock Market Live Updates IPL 2025 - SS Stocks to buy today The Hindu Crossword Gold Rate Today Silver Rate Today Arvind Kejriwal Exclusive Interview Editor\u2019s Note: Putting Muslims in their place?

Nagmohan Das, retired judge of Karnataka High Court, heads the one-man commission of inquiry to recommend internal reservation for Scheduled Caste (SC) communities. | Photo Credit: K. Murali Kumar The commission headed by retired judge H.N. Nagmohan Das, which is overseeing a survey of Scheduled Caste population in Karnataka to draw up internal reservation for them from the 17% reservation matrix, is also exploring the possibility of recommending change in name of certain scheduled caste communities that are used as cuss words. Some of the names of Scheduled Castes communities, including Holeya, Ghantichor and Halalkor, had been used as cuss word in Karnataka, or used to impart a negative connotation. Internal reservation: Survey to map SCs and their socio-economic and education levels in Karnataka to begin today In the survey of scheduled castes, 101 castes and a total of 186 castes, sub-castes and synonymous names are being used for enumeration. The enumerators, commission sources said, have also observed hesitancy among people belonging to these castes to declare their identity openly. \u201cWe have changed the names of the countries, states, cities, villages and roads. Even individuals have got their names changed. In the past, castes have changed their names too. For example, Komiti is now called Arya Vaishya. If this is possible, why not for others? We are working on it,\u201d Mr. Das told The Hindu. He pointed out that of the 186 scheduled castes and sub-castes, many of the names were given by the upper castes. \u201cIs it possible for a caste to call themselves Ghantichor, which means thief? Even the word vadda, which is colloquially used to call someone brash or dirty, is the name a caste\u201dH.N. Nagmohan Dasretired judge of Karnataka High Court The survey, which started on May 5, is part of the exercise to enumerate the scheduled caste population in Karnataka before arriving at a decision on earmarking reservation benefits to Dalit right (Holeya), Dalit left (Madiga) and touchable castes, such as Lambani, Bhovi, Korma, Korcha and Beda Jangama. For decades, Dalit left factions have accused the right factions of enjoying the lion\u2019s share in the reservation benefits in public education and employment. On the number of castes, which have been identified to be used in derogatory sense, Mr. Das said, \u201cThe commission is in the process of studying and identifying this. It is not the question of changing castes, but it is change of name of caste. Use of castes for abusing is unacceptable in a civilised society in the 21st century.\u201d The commission is examining provisions in law and the Constitution, courts observations and directions on the issue, precedent, if any, and comparative changes that have taken place in the country. \u201cWe have to explore consequences and ripple effect,\u201d the retired judge said. D. Chandrashekaraiah of Chalavadi Mahasabha, which represents Dalit right, agreed with the commission\u2019s assessment of caste identity being used as cuss word. \u201cWe also want some names to be changed. However, the problem is that people do not identify themselves as chalavadis in 10 Old Mysuru district. By the time general census commences in 2026, we are hopeful of arriving at some kind of consensus, and we will also seek a code for Chalavadi. Awareness has to be created among people before that to avoid confusion,\u201d he said. Enumerators have reported back to the H. N. Nagmohan Das Commission about hesitancy among Scheduled Caste people in urban areas in acknowledging their caste. \u201cWe have received oral communication from enumerators about such issues. We will verify this information,\u201d said retired judge H.N. Nagmohan Das, who is heading the commission to decide on internal reservation. A source in the commission said that it has been noted that many families, which did not want to participate in the survey due to fear of neighbours identifying them as Scheduled Castes, had told enumerators that they would fill up details online, a provision that was given to those travelling, migrating and to those reluctant to participate in physical enumeration. Online survey would be open between May 19 and May 23, for which Aadhaar number is compulsory.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court had castigated Mr. Shah for passing \"scurrilous\" remarks and using \"language of the gutters\" against Colonel Qureshi, and ordered the police to file an FIR against him on the charge of promoting enmity and hatred.

            "text": "Distant rumblings of dissatisfaction with the recent reconstitution of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) appeared to draw closer on Thursday (May 15 2024), with party veteran K. Sudhakaran, MP, publicly expressing unhappiness at the All India Congress Committee\u2019s (AICC) decision to remove him from the top post. In a freewheeling conversation with reporters in Kannur, Mr. Sudhakaran signalled an allegedly growing disquiet in the Kerala unit of the party about the recent KPCC shake-up. (Notably, former KPCC president V.M. Sudheeran had suggested in Thrissur on Wednesday that discussions in the party would have been more meaningful if they were conducted before the reorganisation and other leaders could make their stance clear on the matter soon.) Mr. Sudhakaran told reporters that the AICC had, at a stroke, \u201cattempted to remove him from State politics\u201d by co-opting him as a permanent invitee to the Congress Working Committee (CWC). He said he had desired to remain as KPCC president. \u201cI did not wish to be removed. The AICC decision caught me unawares. It has caused me acute mental distress\u201d, he said. Mr. Sudhakaran said the AICC general secretary of Kerala, Deepa Dasmunsi, had sought his removal on health grounds. \u201cI do not know who gave Ms. Dasmunsi the unfounded information I was ailing. I also do not know whether she was acting as some national leader\u2019s puppet. The question of why the powers removed me as KPCC president is relevant to the Congress\u2019 rank-and-file,\u201d he added. Mr. Sudhakaran said neither AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge nor Rahul Gandhi, the Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha, had hinted they would remove him as KPCC president. \u201cMr. Gandhi hugged me when I met him and Mr. Kharge in New Delhi. Mr. Kharge invited me to his office for tea\u201d, he said. Mr. Sudhakaran expressed dismay that the party did not give him an official send-off. However, he said he did not desire such a formal gesture. Mr. Sudhakaran also expressed the desire to contest the 2026 Assembly elections. He said as the Congress\u2019 \u201cfrontline soldier\u201d against the Left Democratic Front. Front (LDF), he, being in the fray, would charge up party workers and imbue them with a fierce fighting spirit. Mr. Sudhakaran said \u201cnothing was wrong\u201d with Congress leaders aspiring to be the United Democratic Front\u2019s (UDF) prospective Chief Ministerial candidate. \u201cAt present, there is no serious discussion about such an eventuality. Several individuals covet the position, but how many will achieve their desire is an open-ended question. The AICC will take the final call\u201d, Mr. Sudhakaran said. Mr. Sudhakaran said the new KPCC president, Sunny Joseph, MLA, was neither his nominee nor his standard-bearer. \u201cI elevated Mr. Joseph in the party. I am satisfied that he replaced me. We share an excellent personal relationship,\u201d he said. He added that \u201cit is not as if Mr. Joseph was elevated as KPCC president over other candidates as a concession for me\u201d. Mr. Sudhakaran said his Congress base remained loyal to him. \u201cI am a resourceful leader. I touch the hearts of ordinary party workers, and they reciprocate\u201d, he added.

What are the Constitutional options before a Governor when a Bill is presented to him under Article 200 for assent? Is the Governor bound by the aid and advice tendered by the Council of Ministers? Is the exercise of Constitutional discretion by the Governor under Article 200 justiciable? Is Article 361 of the Constitution (immunity given to President and Governors from legal action while in office) an absolute bar to judicial review in relation to the actions of a Governor under Article 200? In the absence of any Constitutionally prescribed time limit or manner of exercise of powers by a Governor, can time limits be imposed and manner of exercise of powers be prescribed through judicial orders? Is the exercise of Constitutional discretion by the President under Article 201 (dealing with Bills reserved by a Governor for consideration by the President) justiciable? Can judicial orders impose timelines and manner of exercise of powers by the President under Article 201? Is the President required to take advice from the Supreme Court when a Bill is reserved by a Governor for the President\u2019s assent? Are decisions of the Governor and the President under Articles 200 and 201, respectively, justiciable at a stage prior to even the Bill in question becoming a law. Is it permissible for the courts to undertake judicial adjudication over the contents of a Bill, in any manner, before it becomes law? Can the Constitutional powers of the President/Governors be substituted by a judicial order exercising Article 142? Is a law made by the State Legislature a law in force without the assent of the Governor? Is it not mandatory for a Supreme Court Bench to examine if a case involved substantial questions of law regarding interpretation of the Constitution and refer the case to a Bench of a minimum five judges under Article 145(3)? Is Article 142 limited to matters of procedural law or does it extend to issuing directions \u201ccontrary to or inconsistent with existing substantive or procedural provisions of the Constitution\u201d? Is there a bar on the Supreme Court from deciding between the Centre and States other than by way of filing an original suit under Article 131? The President\u2019s move to seek clarity arises from an April 8 judgment of a Supreme Court Bench of Justices JB Pardiwala and R. Mahadevan in a petition filed by the Tamil Nadu government challenging the Governor\u2019s delay in clearing 10 re-passed Bills and his subsequent action to reserve them for consideration by the President. The judgment had declared his action as unconstitutional and invoked Article 142 to set timelines for the President and Governors to act on State Bills. Pointing to this judgment, the Presidential Reference said the \u201cconcept of deemed assent\u201d of the President and the Governor was alien to the Constitutional scheme and fundamentally circumscribed the power of the President and the Governor. The apex court judgment in the Tamil Nadu Governor\u2019s case had held that assent to Bills would be \u201cdeemed\u201d if no action was taken on them by the President or Governor within the prescribed timeline of three months. What are the 10 Bills of Tamil Nadu withheld by Governor R.N. Ravi, now considered assented to after Supreme Court verdict? The Presidential Reference highlighted that States were resorting to approach the apex court under Article 32, and not Article 131, to raise issues \u201cwhich by their very nature are federal issues involving interpretation of the Constitution\u201d. President Murmu has listed a series of 14 questions for the Supreme Court to consider and give an opinion under Article 143.

File | Photo Credit: ANI The Congress on Wednesday (May 14, 2025) hit back at the BJP for taking a swipe at it for parrying a query on calls for boycotting trade and tourism with Turkyie and Azerbaijan, saying the decision on whether or not to have a relationship with any country has to be taken by the government and not the opposition. The Congress' assertion came after the BJP's IT department head Amit Malviya said on X, \"The country is enraged by the support Turkyie and Azerbaijan have extended to the terror state of Pakistan. There has been a growing call to boycott trade and tourism with these countries, and private citizens have stood up in solidarity.\" Significant cancellations reported in outbound travel to T\u00fcrkiye and Azerbaijan But, Mr. Malviya said, the Congress party cannot even bring itself to align with the broader sentiment of the Indian people. He added, \"No wonder it remains so disconnected from the public. It deserves its political oblivion and complete isolation.\" Mr. Malviya's remarks came after Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera told the media that the party will soon get back to them when a question was asked if the party supports the boycott call. Hitting back at Malviya, Congress' media and publicity department head Mr. Khera said, \"Since this question is being raised by an office bearer of the BJP, @PMOIndia & @DrSJaishankar should immediately clarify if the government of India has snapped all diplomatic & trade relations with Turkyie and has also shut their embassy in India.\" \"The decision on whether or not to have a relationship with any country has to be taken by the government and not the opposition. @MEAIndia kindly clarify,\" Mr. Khera said in a post on X.

            "title": "Bengaluru HAL Airport reopening: Stakeholders meet, deliberate on modalities",
            "text": "The HAL Airport today. | Photo Credit: SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT Is it finally time to see some action on reopening the HAL Airport, an air traffic hub right in the heart of the city, before the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) took all civilian flights away in 2008? After years of widespread public demand, the big stakeholders could be nearing a decision. However, despite the overwhelming evidence of public convenience, challenges remain. All the key stakeholders met in Delhi on April 15 and discussed the issue threadbare. A flashy new second airport for the city could take at least a decade to be operationalised. But if the stakeholders decide, the existing HAL airport could be up and ready for flights in weeks. The big question: Will the State and Centre, Airports Authority of India (AAI), the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) and HAL reach a consensus to act? The Delhi meeting last month had the stakeholders deliberate on the question of the modalities related to who will run the HAL airport if it is reopened, Bengaluru South MP Tejasvi Surya told The Hindu. \u201cThe question is about whether AAI or BIAL will do it. AAI is keen that they will themselves do the operations while BIAL says there is a no-compete clause, and therefore they will have to be given the opportunity to run the operations. So the modalities are being worked out how this can be done,\u201d he explained. Since the first meeting was not conclusive, the Civil Aviation Secretary has asked the stakeholders to meet again. Tejasvi elaborated: \u201cI am told that the (next) meeting will discuss threadbare the details and modalities and bring a few workable propositions to the table. I am meeting with the Civil Aviation Minister again sometime this month, maybe next time I go to Delhi for the next PAC meeting. I will raise this matter again and let\u2019s see where this is going to go.\u201d Today, it takes almost two hours to even reach the gates of the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA), more than 40kms away from the city centre. The chaotic Hebbal interchange is in a mess, severely slowing down airport approach by road. The much-hyped Airport Metro connectivity is at least 2.5 years away, and the suburban railway corridor is nowhere in the picture. The big question is: Will the BIAL allow an amendment to the concession agreement that disallows any commercial airport within an aerial distance of 150km from KIA? The agreement signed with the Union Ministry of Civil Aviation, and the State Government as a signatory, is effective till May 2033. In October 2020, the State Cabinet had agreed to extend the concession agreement by 30 years. Significantly, it had a clause that BIAL would be allowed to operate the HAL airport for civilian use by exempting the latter from the 150km agreement condition. However, in 2024 April, a formal government notification on the extension did not mention HAL airport or the related clause. For HAL, the airport had to be operational 24/7 for its fighter jet test flights, chartered VVIP and military personnel flights in all these 17 years. But to generate revenue, it wanted to reopen for civilian flights and was in touch with BIAL and the government for years. \u201cThe opening of HAL airport should be welcomed in the interest of the traveling public. The infrastructure is already there and can be readied with some uplift once the decision to allow commercial flights are taken,\u201d says Gopal Sutar, who recently retired as HAL spokesperson. According to him, reopening makes sense since the current airport is getting extremely busy and in recent times flights have been diverted to Chennai due to traffic congestion. However, a full-fledged reopening is unlikely since HAL is under pressure to accelerate its military aircraft manufacture and testing. As aviation analyst Sanjeev Dyamannavar points out, \u201cThey could operate 10-12 civilian flights in the early morning and late evening. Not more than that. Even late-night flights to Delhi or Mumbai can take off and land here, apart from the regional ones to Huballi and other destinations. KIA will not have slots during peak hours, particularly after 7 p.m.,\u201d he says. However, Gopal says this will not be an issue and cites the case of Goa\u2019s Dabolim airport operated by AAI as a civil enclave in an Indian Navy airbase. Unlike KIA, HAL Airport does not face major accessibility issues. But the mounting traffic on Old Airport Road remains a challenge with no plans for a Metro line on that route. However, there are options to explore road connectivity from the Inner Ring Road side and through Yemalur from the Outer Ring Road side. These would be critical if the objective is to offer flyers from Whitefield, Mahadevapura, HAL, Indiranagar and other East Bengaluru localities an alternative to KIA for short-haul flights. Urbanist V. Ravichandar puts this in perspective when he says: \u201cOpening HAL airport makes sense if we wish to sweat our existing assets optimally. It could be used for short haul flights under an hour.\u201d He feels there will be challenges in investing in new infrastructure, and it would be dependent on BIAL willing to go along with the plan since they have airport rights till 2033. Tejasvi Surya had indicated in February that both BIAL and HAL were keen to get the airport reopened. So was the Civil Aviation Minister. He was convinced that the old airport would augment BIAL\u2019s capacity, while creating a revenue stream for HAL.

            "text": "A Motor Vehicles department official checking the fitness of a school bus in Kozhikode in this file photo. To enhance the safety of students travelling in educational institution buses, the Motor Vehicles department (MVD) and the police have decided to put in place stringent norms for school bus drivers in Kozhikode. Only those who complete the one-day training programme of the MVD on safe driving, which was officially launched here on Wednesday, will be permitted to drive educational institution vehicles from the next academic year. Drivers who undergo training will be issued a certificate, which has to be shown to enforcement squads during flash vehicle checks as part of heightened safety measures. Training will be given after verification of the licence. Police clearance certificates will also be made mandatory in case the drivers have a history of involvement in traffic rule violations. According to MVD officials, the fitness check of educational institution vehicles, a mandatory exercise carried out every year, will be completed by the end of May. Automated facilities will also be used to complete the process. By August, CCTV cameras will also be made mandatory for all educational institution vehicles, they said. Traffic police officials said the fitness check was expected to cover over 1,000 school buses in Kozhikode city alone. They made it clear that safety norms would be equally applicable to drivers working for private coaching centres. For vehicles other than school buses, the stickers issued after police checking will be mandatory to operate pick-and-drop services. Mobile enforcement squads of the police and the MVD will jointly conduct checking to expose safety rule violations, they affirmed. Meanwhile, the proposal to enable the GPS tracking system in school buses is still hanging in the balance due to the alleged lack of cooperation on the part of various school managements. Now, the GPS system is functional only in very few private institution buses in Kozhikode. The MVD\u2019s Vidhya Vahan mobile application designed for the purpose also remain underutilised. Similarly, the launch of radio frequency identification and detection (RFID) cards for students, which was planned several years ago to track the entry and exit of students in school buses, has also not been implemented. Sources in the MVD and the police said technical issues related to the setting up of an exclusive server continued to be a major hurdle to its implementation.

Responding to the media over the speculations during a programme on Wednesday, Mr. Veerraju pointed out that several YSRCP leaders had previously switched loyalty to the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), and the TDP leaders too crossed over to the YSRCP. Those leaders were even given prominent positions, he noted.

DEEPAK A good mango harvest has brought down the prices of the fruit in Visakhapatnam as produce from the orchards nearby floods the city markets. Vendors putting heaps of mangoes for sale is now a common sight in almost every street and marketplace in the city. Several varieties of mangoes, which used to be sold for \u20b9100 per kg in the previous years, are now available at just \u20b960, much to the delight of the mango lovers. According to marketing department officials, the influx of mangoes this season is primarily from Cheepurupalli, Rajam, and Kottavalasa in Vizianagaram district, as well as K.Kotapadu, Kasimkota, and Narsipatnam in Anakapalli district. A. Lakshmi, a vendor in One Town, said that she had purchased mangoes from the wholesale market in Kottavalasa and is selling them, starting at \u20b950 per kg. G. Prasad, Estate Officer at Gopalapatnam Rythu Bazaar, confirmed that this season\u2019s crop was not only plenty but also arrived all at once, leading to a drop in prices. He noted that mango prices, which were around \u20b9100 per kg earlier, have fallen to \u20b955 to \u20b960 and may decrease further. However, premium varieties such as Panudu Mamidi, Kothapalli Kobbari, and Panchadhara Kanchelu, mostly sourced from the Krishna district, are priced at \u20b9100 per kg. \u201cDespite the availability of local produce, many consumers prefer the Krishna district varieties due to their reputation for taste and quality,\u201d said Mr. Raju. With the fruit now abundantly available and prices significantly reduced, many people are seen buying mangoes in bulk quantities from local markets. \u201cWho would want to miss out on mangoes in the summer? My children love eating Banginapalli along with their lunch. We are making the most of the price drop,\u201d said Ginni Swathi, a resident of MVP Colony."

They seized seven mobile phones, three knives and a black bag from their possession. Three more accused persons are absconding. Revealing the case details to mediapersons here on Wednesday evening, Prakasam SP A.R. Damodar said the police team identified the two wheelers abandoned by the accused, and traced them. \u201cWhile the search was on, the special teams arrested Borlagunta Vinod Kumar, Tuvar Vamshi Krishnai, Bellamkonda Venkata Goutham, Mannem Teja, Marturi Kiran Kumar, Sheikh Sameer, Alla Sambasiva Rao, Veeragandham Devendranath Chowdary, and Thota Srinivas Rao. According to the SP, Sambasiva Rao and Muppa Suresh, were initially aligned with deceased TDP leader Veeraiah, but later turned against him over village matters. This led to a power struggle, escalating tensions and fostering enmity. With an intent to eliminate Veeraiah and gain dominance in the constituency, they involved Vinod and another accused in killing him. Together, they hired contract killers Tuvar Vamshi Krishna and Mannem Teja. Vinod also involved Bellamkonda Venkata Goutham and Goutham\u2019s friend Nagaraju, who agreed to participate in the murder. On the night of April 22, the hired killers stabbed Veeraiah with knives, threatened the office staff and fled on the two wheelers. These two vehicles helped the police in tracing the accused. Before the murder, Vinod\u2019s relative, Marturi Kiran, visited a lodge in Ongole, stayed with the accused, and participated in the planning. After the murder, Kiran promised to provide shelter to Vinod and assured the accused that he would arrange legal representation through known advocates."

In a review meeting held on Wednesday, Mr. Vijayanand requested BHEL to prioritise the completion of Polavaram and Lower Sileru projects. BHEL CMD K.

The decision is attributed to Section-95 of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, which says that the existing admission quotas in all government and private institutions, whether aided or unaided, for higher and technical education, will continue for a period of 10 years from the appointed day of bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh during which the existing common admission process will continue. Now that the period of 10 years since bifurcation of the State has been completed (on June 2, 2024), Secretary of the AP State Council of Higher Education (APSCHE), in a report submitted to the government, called for attention to the issue and appropriate measures to protect the interests of students hailing from the State. Secretary, Department of Higher Education, Kona Sasidhar said these amendments, as a temporary measure, would come into force with immediate effect for taking up admissions for the academic year 2025-26 only to courses of Under Graduate, Post Graduate and Ph.D. courses (Regular/Lateral entry), (Engineering, Technology, Pharmacy, Architecture, Pharm. D, Business Administration, Computer Applications, Law Education and Physical Education). He said necessary measures were being taken to make immediate amendments to the Andhra Pradesh Educational Institutions (Regulation of Admissions) Order, 1974. A GO issued to this effect implied that henceforth, all seats in higher education and technical education colleges would be reserved for students of Andhra Pradesh only. The Telangana government had made similar change earlier this year on February 27, 2025 by scrapping the 15% non-local quota in its higher educational institutions.

Ms. Sabareesh stated that the gathering was part of a broader initiative to create employment opportunities in line with the interests and qualifications of transgender persons. She added that GHMC would not only offer job opportunities within its departments but would also provide skill development training for jobs beyond the civic body. Mr. Chandrakant Reddy urged transgender individuals to select fields aligned with their educational qualifications, skills, and interests, assuring that targeted training would be provided to facilitate their employment. He further explained that for those not eligible for jobs, the GHMC is helping form self-help groups to promote economic self-reliance. So far, three transgender SHGs have been established in LB Nagar zone, and efforts are underway to link them to banking systems. He encouraged more individuals to come forward and join such groups. The range of job roles available within GHMC include security guards at parks, metro stations and drinking water reservoirs, green marshals in the cleanliness drives, supporting staff in water quality testing, streetlight maintenance, and paramedics in Basti Dawakhanas, and trans persons may be employed in the roles based on their qualifications and training. GHMC\u2019s Sports Additional Commissioner Yadagiri Rao highlighted that the sports department offers a wide spectrum of employment opportunities, accommodating candidates with no formal education to highly qualified individuals. During the meeting, several transgender NGO representatives shared insights on training being provided through skill development centres and elaborated on ongoing programmes, market linkages, and the support available through training institutes."

Chandrababu Naidu has asserted that farmers have benefited and their incomes doubled whenever the TDP is in power. \u201cThe agriculture sector\u2019s contribution to the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) is less compared to the services sector. Notwithstanding, the State government is determined to give a fillip to the agriculture and allied sectors, given the fact that farmers\u2019 income is important than State revenues,\u201d Mr. Naidu said while addressing the Animal Husbandry-Tech AI 2.0 conclave here on Wednesday. Mr. Naidu said Andhra Pradesh topped the country in agriculture. The State was know as \u2018Annapoorna\u2019. However, the services and industrial sectors also needed growth. In Telangana, 67% of income came from the services sector, whereas in Andhra Pradeh, it was only 46%. Under the TDP government, the dairy sector, too, grew at 22% CAGR (compound annual growth rate), he said. Currently, livestock generated \u20b91.69 lakh crore income, and as many as 42 lakh families depended on livestock. The State\u2019s livestock contribution to the GSDP grew from \u20b943,127 crore in 2014\u201315 to \u20b991,633 crore by 2018\u201319, marking a 21% CAGR during the TDP government\u2019s tenure. However, the growth rate declined to 11% between 2019\u201324, he said. The Chief Minister said that in 2024\u201325, the livestock sector earned \u20b91.69 lakh crore. The target for 2025\u201326 was set at \u20b91.95 lakh crore. The Animal Husbandry Department, which played a vital role in driving Andhra Pradesh\u2019s growth, would continue to receive top priority under the NDA government, Mr. Naidu said, adding, currently, the sector contributed 11.23% to the GSDP. Mr. Naidu underlined the need to promote high-value horticulture crops, which bring higher returns compared to traditional farming. Horticulture on 18 lakh hectares currently generates \u20b91.55 lakh crore, while agriculture across 50 lakh hectares brings \u20b955,000 crore. \u201cThe goal is to double the horticulture area to 36 lakh hectares. Hence, the government plans to promote high-income horticultural crops, increasing coverage from 18 to 36 lakh hectares,\u201d he said. Outlining the government\u2019s vision for the livestock and poultry industries, Mr. Naidu announced key reforms, including exemption of property and house tax on village-level dairy sheds. The government would streamline Central schemes online, review mobile veterinary ambulance requirements, and integrate NREGS for water supply and fodder-related work. Deputy Chief Minister K. Pawan Kalyan would work closely with departments to design actionable roadmaps. The State would provide solar power of up to 1,000 units, introduce grass-cutting machines for women, and expand micro-irrigation to 2.5 lakh acres this year, he added.

Today we earmarked the plot of land and cleared it for the project. The subsequent steps, like releasing tenders, are underway,\u201d the Chief Minister announced. New Town is located on the outskirts of Kolkata and has emerged as a booming business district. \u201cKeep in mind, whether it is innovation, entertainment, creativity, cultural programmes or many other events, the concept of a concert economy is an innovative idea. We have the infrastructure here. 25 acres is a huge land area, and this will be of international standard. Here, we can host international-level cultural events. People from across the country will also come,\u201d the Chief Minister said. She added that the park has been named \u2018Biswa Angan\u2019 (courtyard of the world) in Bengali and \u2018IITEC\u2019 in English, which stands for \u2018international information, technology, entertainment, and culture\u2019.

On Tuesday, the Chief Minister also announced the development of new malls and large-scale marketplaces in 23 districts of the State, directed primarily towards the local artisans who are part of self-help groups (SHGs). \u201cWe will build 23 shopping malls and big marketplaces in 23 districts. The government will give one acre of land for free. Private parties will undertake the construction. In exchange for the land, they will give two floors to the self-help groups for free,\u201d Ms. Banerjee said. She added that the two floors will be dedicated entirely to handmade goods made locally by the district\u2019s SHGs. \u201cThis will ensure a market for the SHGs,\u201d the Chief Minister said. She also said that the government gave clearances for this project in 11 districts, namely Purulia, Darjeeling, Bankura, Coochbehar, Howrah, Jalpaiguri, Jhargram, Murshidabad, Paschim Midnapore, and Uttar Dinajpur. \u201cSince there is now the Jagannath Dham in Digha and many visitors would like to shop from there, we are also looking for a good plot of land so we can build a good marketplace there, in addition to the existing markets,\u201d the Chief Minister said. The Chief Minister also announced that ten industrial plots with a cumulative area of 2,515 acres in the State will be allocated to multiple major companies, especially in the steel industry. \u201cThese projects will draw investments worth over \u20b925,000 crores. More than 70,000 people will benefit from direct and indirect employment,\u201d she said. She added that on Tuesday, 15 industrial estates in the districts were allotted for the development of 43 micro and small-scale industries. She claimed that these would draw investments worth hundreds of crores and aid in job creation across the State. \u201cBengal is leading in the MSME sector in the country\u2026 There is high demand for industrial growth in Bengal.

The decision, made by the Paschim Maharashtra Devasthan Management Committee, aims to uphold the sanctity, purity, and tradition of these revered temples. A notification issued by the committee outlines the dress code, mandating that devotees wear traditional and modest attire, including sarees, salwar-kameez, dhotar, and pajama-kurta. The committee has also stated that entry will be denied to individuals wearing revealing clothing, urging all devotees to comply with these guidelines. Shivraj Naik, the Secretary of the temple committee, emphasized the importance of modest dressing. \u201cDevotees should avoid wearing revealing clothes and, if possible, choose traditional outfits when visiting the temple. The guidelines have been issued to ensure that devotees dress modestly and respect the sanctity of the temple,\u201d Mr. Naik said. This move follows similar measures recently introduced at the Tulja Bhavani temple in Tuljapur, where the Maharashtra Mandir Mahasangh enforced a similar dress code to preserve the temple\u2019s sanctity. For those unaware of the dress code, the committee has made arrangements for traditional attire to be available at shops near the temple. Visitors can purchase sovala - a dhoti and uparna (shawl-like garment) for men, and sarees for women - before entering the temple.

Ramadoss\u2019 concluding speech \u2014 wherein he had hinted at \u201cgroups being formed within the party\u201d and insisted that he would take the final call on an alliance \u2014 has taken the focus away from the success of the conference to festering internal disagreements over who is likely to wield power in the PMK, especially with the Assembly election being less than a year away. Speaking after his son and PMK president Anbumani Ramadoss hit out at the DMK over the caste census and internal reservation for Vanniyars within the MBC quota, Dr. Ramadoss began his address with a stern warning to the DMK, but digressed towards the non-performance of his party\u2019s office-bearers and \u201cfactions in the PMK\u201d. \u201cYou are not working hard. I am ready to work hard even at this age. Our people are not voting for us. It should not be the case. I will decide on the alliance, you don\u2019t have to worry about it. We are tracking your progress. You cannot do anything by resorting to flattery from now on. There are alliances within the party. You correct yourself...,\u201d Dr. Ramadoss had said. When asked why Dr. Ramadoss was so critical of the party\u2019s functioning, giving rise to speculations of unresolved issues between him and Dr. Anbumani, a section of second line leaders in the party said the general feeling was that Dr. Anbumani was the future. While agreeing that there were leaders in the party who still backed Dr. Ramadoss, a senior leader said that the PMK\u2019s second line leaders felt that, of late, Dr. Ramadoss was \u201cputting them in a difficult situation\u201d. He, however, stressed that the leaders gave Dr. Ramadoss the respect he deserved. \u201cWe are tolerating what he [Dr. Ramadoss] is saying these days. He should have ended his speech after the demand for [internal] reservation. However, we as partymen, have heard this speech within four walls so many times. It is only new to you [members of the public]. We will give him the respect he deserves, but the party is firmly with Dr. Anbumani. After all, a decision on the alliance will be taken by the general council...; and we are a part of it. The majority of us will not accept any unilateral decision taken by him [Dr. Ramadoss],\u201d the senior leader said. Another well-known PMK leader said Dr. Ramadoss\u2019 speech was \u201cshocking\u201d and typical of \u201cold men in every household\u201d. \u201cHis speech was shocking for us. He is a veteran leader, who has achieved a lot in Tamil Nadu politics. But here [at the conference], he was speaking about personal issues that had no relevance to party, cadre or the community. The party will have to move on with Dr. Anbumani,\u201d he added. We have migrated to a new commenting platform.

Petitioners say that the amended law interferes with the right of Muslims to manage their religious affairs and properties. | Photo Credit: K. MURALI KUMAR A Bench of Chief Justice of India B.R. Gavai and Justice Augustine George Masih is scheduled to hear the challenge to the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, in the Supreme Court on Thursday. The case last came up before a three-judge Special Bench led by Chief Justice Gavai\u2019s predecessor, Justice Sanjiv Khanna, on May 5. Justice Khanna had at the time expressed reluctance to continue hearing the case, saying he had very little time till his retirement on May 13. Misuse of Waqf law led to amendments, Centre informs Supreme Court The May 5 hearing had been scheduled for arguments on a plea to stay the implementation of the 2025 amendments to the Waqf law, which, according to the petitioners, interfered with the right of Muslims to manage their own religious affairs and properties. Prior to May 5, the Bench of Justices Khanna, Sanjay Kumar and K.V. Viswanathan had nudged the government on April 17 into coming out with a statement in open court that it would not change the character or alter the status of waqf properties across the country on the basis of these amendments. The Bench had recorded the statement in its April 17 order. The interregnum between the April 17 hearing and May 5 had seen the government file an affidavit in court, highlighting the \u201cphenomenal increase\u201d in waqf assets in the decade between 2013 and 2024, while justifying the 2025 amendments as a necessary measure to counter rampant encroachments into government and private properties made in the name of waqfs. However, Justice Khanna opened the May 5 hearing, saying the issues raised were serious and should be heard finally. However, he had said that with little time left in his tenure, he did not want to reserve orders on the plea for an interim stay of the law. He then posted the case on May 15. The hearing on May 15 before a two-judge Bench with neither Justice Kumar or Justice Viswanathan on board may indicate what lies ahead. Supreme Court refuses to entertain fresh plea challenging Waqf (Amendment) Act The case has over a 100 petitioners. The Supreme Court had converted the case into a suo motu one in order to avoid repetitive petitions from being filed. The petitions have argued that the 2025 amendments infringed upon and prejudiced the rights of Muslims across the country. The amendments fundamentally altered the governance, creation, and protection of waqf properties \u2014 Islamic endowments dedicated perpetually to Allah for religious and charitable purposes. The enhanced role of state in the waqf administration impinged on the right of the Muslim community to manage its institutions. The petitions have highlighted that the amendments omitted the concept of \u2018waqf-by-user\u2019 affirmed by the Supreme Court itself as a property that would attain the status of waqf through long-standing religious use. Further, an amendment to the composition of the Waqf Board and the Central Waqf Council has mandated inclusion of non-Muslim members in waqf administrative bodies, they noted.

The SRS 2021 data showed that the all-India crude birth rate was 19.3 in 2021, dropping at a rate of 1.12% every year from 2016 to 2021. In comparison, in the same period, the birth rate for Tamil Nadu has been declining at a rate of 2.35% every year, Delhi\u2019s has been declining at a rate of 2.23% and Kerala\u2019s is dropping at a rate of 2.05%. Total Fertility Rate remains constant at 2.0 in 2021: report The data showed that the slowest rate of decline in birth rate was seen in States such as Rajasthan (0.48%), Bihar (0.86%), Chhattisgarh (0.98%), Jharkhand (0.98%), Assam (1.05%), Madhya Pradesh (1.05%), West Bengal (1.08%), and Uttar Pradesh (1.09%). The data further revealed that Uttarakhand was the only State which saw a rise in birth rate in this period. The birth rates data from the SRS 2021 further revealed that the rate of decline was faster than the national average for 13 large States and union territories. All southern States \u2014 Andhra Pradesh (1.26%), Telangana (1.67%), Karnataka (1.68%), Kerala, and Tamil Nadu \u2014 featured among these 13 large States and union territories. The SRS is the largest demographic survey in the country, meant to provide annual estimates on fertility and mortality indicators such as birth rates, death rates, etc. Conducted in 8,842 sample units all over India with a sample size of about 84 lakh, the 2021 SRS survey data gave a picture of population trends that have usually been read with figures reported in decadal Censuses. The 2021 Census has not yet been conducted. Apart from the southern States, birth rates were seen declining faster than the national average for Maharashtra (1.57%), Gujarat (1.24%), Odisha (1.34%), Himachal Pradesh (1.29%), Haryana (1.21%), and Jammu and Kashmir (1.47%), with Punjab\u2019s birth rate declining almost at the same rate as that of the national average. Why are fertility levels declining in India? | Explained Corresponding to this data set in the SRS 2021 Statistical Report, the Civil Registration System 2021 dataset showed that some of the States seeing the slowest decline in birth rates are also reporting increasing number of registered births. The Vital Statistics Report based on CRS 2021 showed that the number of registered births were seeing a rise in about 11 States and union territories, which included Bihar, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Lakshadweep, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Nagaland. The CRS 2021 dataset further showed that in the southern States of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala, the number of registered births has been on the decline since at least 2012, with Andhra Pradesh seeing a slight uptick in 2021. Telangana\u2019s registered births saw a sharp uptick after 2019 but following 2020, there was a dramatic drop in these numbers. The SRS 2021 data on total fertility rate (TFR) and gross reproduction rate (GRR) too correspond to the birth rate data \u2014 showing that States such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh had a TFR and GRR higher than the national average. The TFR measures average number of children expected to be born per woman during her entire span of reproductive period. While India\u2019s TFR stood at 2 in 2021, Bihar reported a TFR of 3, Uttar Pradesh had a TFR of 2.7, Rajasthan\u2019s TFR was at 2.4 and Madhya Pradesh\u2019s was 2.6. Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu attain U.N. Sustainable Development Goals in MMR, U5MR, NMR, says report Similarly, the GRR for India stood at 1, meaning that on an average, each woman in India is having one daughter who survives to reproductive age and has children of her own, according to the SRS 2021. In Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh the GRR was significantly higher than the India average \u2014 at 1.4, 1.2, 1.2, and 1.3 respectively. However, for West Bengal, which reported rising registered births and amongst the slowest decline in crude birth rates, the TFR stood at the lowest among bigger States and union territories at 1.4 and so did the GRR, which was at 0.7.

TRF, founded in 2019, began as a little-known anti-India front that opposed the entry of \u201coutsiders\u201d to Kashmir and over the last few years, it has come under the focus of the Indian authorities. The group started by spreading anti-India messages on the Telegram app, and post-Pahalgam, it has also been described as an off-shoot of the Pakistan-based terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba that India has accused of carrying out a large number of terror strikes both inside and outside Kashmir. During the Operation Sindoor of May 7, India bombed a large complex in Muridke near Islamabad that India claims to be the base of the Lashkar-e-Taiba. From the Indian point of view, the attack in Pahalgam is an extension of the Lashkar-e-Taiba\u2019s list of terror strikes that also include the 26/11 attack in Mumbai.

In one instance, on May 4, two Air India planes transported 300 undocumented migrants, including 200 women and children, who were earlier detained in Gujarat, to Agartala in Tripura. They were subsequently sent to Bangladesh via the land border. Voluntary return of undocumented migrants at Bangladesh border increased after government crackdown, say officials On April 26, the Gujarat Police had detained over 1,000 suspected Bangladeshi nationals from Ahmedabad and Surat. According to a government official, as many as 295 Bangladeshis were \u201cdeported\u201d in 2024, and this year till April 30, around 100 Bangladeshi citizens have been deported and handed over to the Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB). According to the Daily Star, a Bangladesh daily, the Foreign Ministry of Bangladesh sent a letter to India on May 8 \u201craising concern over people being pushed into the country and urged New Delhi to adhere to established repatriation mechanisms\u201d. On Wednesday (May 14, 2025), Rajasthan Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Jogaram Patel said in Jaipur that about 1,000 suspected Bangladeshi nationals had been identified as residing in different parts of the State. \u201cThe first batch of 148 Bangladeshi nationals was transported to Jodhpur and flown to Kolkata on Wednesday (May 14, 2025). From there, they will be deported to Bangladesh,\u201d Mr. Patel said. According to sources, most of the detainees brought to Jodhpur were from Sikar district. The Village Development Officers\u2019 Training Centre in Jodhpur has been temporarily converted into a detention facility for the Bangladeshi nationals. Mr. Patel said a similar deportation process would be followed for pushing back the foreign nationals in the coming days. On May 10, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said at a press conference in Guwahati that the government had decided to implement the \u201cpush back\u201d mechanism to check infiltration instead of going through the legal route. India squandered its strategic advantage during the birth of Bangladesh, says Assam CM \u201cInfiltration is a big issue. We have now decided we will not go through the legal process. Earlier, decision was to arrest a person and then bring him to the Indian legal system... Earlier also we used to arrest 1,000-1,500 foreigners...they must be sent to jail and then they are produced before a court of law. Now, we have decided that we will not bring them inside the country, we will push them. This pushing back is a new phenomenon. Every year, 5,000 people enter the country and because of pushback this number will become minimise now,\u201d Mr. Sarma said. On concerns raised by Bangladesh, the government official quoted above said, \u201cThese are their citizens and they should accept them.\u201d After political changes in Bangladesh in August 2024, on the directions of the Union Home Ministry, the States started a crackdown on illegally staying foreigners in the country. The momentum increased after the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, officials said. The Hindu reported on March 31 that the voluntary return of undocumented Bangladeshis had also seen an increase following the crackdown. Against 337 undocumented Bangladeshis without visas and passports who were apprehended while crossing the eastern border into that country from January to July 2024, those apprehended in the subsequent months, from August 2024 till March 21 this year, stood at 906. Out of this, 411 exits had been recorded from January to March."

Sudhakaran on Wednesday evening. The violence erupted when the rally reached the Malapattam town culminating in a confrontation in front of the CPI(M) local committee office. Following the destruction of the Congress\u2019s Gandhi Stupa here last week, a foot march and a meeting were held on Wednesday. Despite police intervention, classes occurred near the A. Kunhikannan memorial hall, which houses the CPI(M) office. Leaders from both the political outfits rushed to the scene to pacify their respective workers. The situation remained tense and the police are camping in the area to prevent further violence. Speaking at the venue, Mr. Mamkootathil accused the CPI(M) workers of launching an unprovoked attack on the peaceful event. \u201cWe had all the necessary permissions, yet the CPI(M) workers tried to disrupt the event. Instead of intervening against the attackers, the police asked our workers to disperse,\u201d he said. He alleged bias in the stance of the Assistant Commissioner of Police. \u201cWhy were we asked to leave while the CPI(M) workers continued their attack?\u201d he said. Condemning the attack, Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan termed the clashes in Malapattam an instance of \u201cCPI(M) hooliganism\u201d and accusing the police of siding with the CPI(M) workers who allegedly attacked the Youth Congress rally. Mr. Satheesan accused Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and CPI(M) State secretary M.V. Govindan of failing to rein in the party cadres. \u201cThe police must not degrade themselves into Red volunteers,\u201d he added, claiming that the law enforcement remained passive while CPI(M) workers acted violently in Mr. Govindan\u2019s home constituency.

File | Photo Credit: ANI In a significant policy decision, the Odisha Government on Wednesday (May 14, 2025) approved a proposal to introduce 11.25% reservation for students from the Socially and Economically Backward Classes (SEBC) in admissions to State-owned and State-funded institutions of higher education. The decision, approved by the State Cabinet chaired by Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi, will be implemented from the academic year 2025\u201326. The reservation will be applicable in State public universities, Government and aided higher secondary schools and colleges functioning under the School and Mass Education, Higher Education, Odia Language, Literature and Culture, and Sports and Youth Services Departments. A Government statement said the move is aimed at ensuring uniform implementation of reservation across categories. The new policy aligns with the reservation structure that includes 22.5% for Scheduled Tribes (ST), 16.25% for Scheduled Castes (SC), 11.25% for SEBC, 5% for Persons with Disabilities (PwD), and 1% for Ex-Servicemen. Odisha forum urges Parliamentary Committee on OBC welfare to bat for national caste Census \u201cThe initiative seeks to promote access, equity and inclusion, increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER), and enhance opportunities for marginalised and disadvantaged communities in Odisha in line with the National Education Policy 2020,\u201d the statement noted. Odisha had hitherto not provided reservation for SEBC/OBC students in education, despite longstanding demands from across the political spectrum for the implementation of a 27% quota. In the sphere of employment, the State had earlier implemented a 27% reservation for OBC/SEBC candidates in 1994. However, this was overturned following a 1998 judgment by the Odisha Administrative Tribunal, which was later upheld by the high court in 2007. Since then, SEBC reservation in public employment has remained at 11.25%. BJD welcomes Union Cabinet\u2019s decision to include caste enumeration in census exercise Reacting to the Cabinet decision, former Union Minister and senior Congress leader Srikant Jena, in a letter to Chief Minister Majhi, criticised the measure as inadequate. He pointed out that SEBCs constitute nearly 54% of Odisha\u2019s population and accused successive governments of neglecting their educational rights. \u201cDue to the absence of proper reservation, more than 7,000 SEBC students have lost medical seats, and nearly 50,000 job opportunities have been denied,\u201d Mr. Jena alleged, reiterating his demand for the immediate implementation of the constitutionally mandated 27% reservation in both education and employment.

The government scheme, he said, was aimed at identifying one lakh students who were victims of circumstances, guiding them through the process and enrolling them in institutions of higher learning. This year, 50 youth came out with flying colours in the UPSC exam, while 58 passed competitive exams conducted by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), the Railway Recruitment Board (RRB) and the Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS), he said. \u201cYour success will encourage many more students undergoing training at government coaching centres across the State,\u201d Mr. Udhayanidhi said.

The Indian yak (Bos grunniens), often called the \u2018ship of the Himalayas\u2019, is an integral part of the economy of high-altitude dwellers, who depend on it for meat, milk, and transportation. The bovine animal has long been recognised for its resilience and adaptability to extreme conditions. Mihir Sarkar, the director of ICAR-National Research Centre on Yak in Arunachal Pradesh\u2019s Dirang, said the \u201cleap for yak genomic science\u201c marks a significant milestone that promises to revolutionise yak breeding programmes, conservation efforts, and the understanding of the genetic complexities of this vital species and its ecological role in the Himalayan landscape. The research team utilised cutting-edge long-read sequencing technology and bioinformatics tools to generate the chromosome-level assembly, which maps the genes to their specific locations on the chromosomes, offering a significantly clearer and comprehensive picture. \u201cA comparative genomics between other bovine species with the generated data will open up allele mining for useful genes contributing to biotic and abiotic stresses and quality traits. The availability of a detailed genome is expected to benefit scientific research and local livestock management practices,\u201d Dr. Rakshit said. \u201cWith this genome, we can better understand how to sustain yak populations across the Himalayan belt,\u201d Dr. Mohanty said. \u201cThis resource will be invaluable for identifying genetic markers for traits like cold tolerance, disease resistance, and milk production with much greater precision, which will ensure the long-term sustainability of yak populations and ultimately lead to the socio-economic uplift of yak herders,\u201d Dr. Pukhrambam said. In India, yaks are found above 7,000 feet in Ladakh, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, and Himachal Pradesh. They face numerous challenges, including reduced grazing area, climate change, disease, and genetic erosion. Copyright\u00a9 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

We anticipate further interest in Indian systems,\u201d he said. Over the course of five days as Operation Sindoor was launched on the night of May 6-7, the country\u2019s air defence network proved its capability and resilience as Pakistan launched hundreds of drones in waves, Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles and missiles inclining high-speed ones most of which were shot down, with only a few making an impact. Operation Sindoor also produced concrete evidence of hostile technologies neutralised by the Indian systems \u2014 with the recovery of pieces of Chinese PL-15 air-to-air missiles, Turkish-origin UAVs, long-range rockets, quadcopters and commercial drones, the PIB statement noted. \u201cThese were recovered and identified, showing that despite Pakistan\u2019s attempts to exploit advanced foreign-supplied weaponry, India\u2019s indigenous air defence and electronic warfare networks remained superior,\u201d it said. Executed assigned tasks with precision during Operation Sindoor: IAF The nearly \u20b92,000-crore contract for Akashteer, a networking and automation project, was signed in March 2023 and was fielded a year after that.

The master plan and Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the project have already been completed and the implementation would be coordinated by the Kerala Industrial Corridor Development Corporation Ltd. (KICDC), it said. So far, the State government has spent \u20b91,489 crore through the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) for land acquisition and the Centre will spend \u20b91,789.92 crore on infrastructure development in the project area, the release said. \u201cThe Central share will be disbursed in phases as the State government hands over the acquired land to the SPV. In December 2024 the 1st tranche of the equity was transferred to the SPV by the State and Central governments as 110 acres of land and \u20b9104.5 crore respectively,\u201d it said.

            "text": "A pastor in eastern Assam\u2019s Golaghat district, who was arrested on charges of converting people through magical healing, said he had faith in the \u201cpower\u201d of the Constitution of India to deliver justice. \u2018Magic healing\u2019 case against Assam church leader dismissed A day after the Golaghat district court dismissed the case against him, pastor Pranjal Bhuyan told The Hindu on Wednesday (May 14, 2025) that the collective prayers of Christians and non-Christians had also played a role in absolving him of a crime he did not commit. The 38-year-old project coordinator of Golaghat Baptist Church was arrested on November 23, 2024, under the Assam Healing (Prevention of Evil) Practices Act of 2024, which seeks to curb deceptive healing practices. The first person to have been arrested under this Act, he was released on bail six days later. \u201cThe police complaint was filed by a group of people who did not know me. I did not know any of them either. They could have been influenced by someone or instigated through social media, which spreads hatred,\u201d Mr. Bhuyan said. \u201cWhy should I force or lure people through magical practices to convert when I adopted Christianity voluntarily after stepping into adulthood?\u201d he asked. A Hindu by birth, Mr. Bhuyan said he became a Christian in 2006 after watching some shows by televangelists or television preachers. \u201cI faced a lot of resistance at home, but my parents relented after they found my association with the church made me a better person with a positive attitude. They became Christians six years after me,\u201d he said. Mr. Bhuyan denied using magic or tricks to brainwash people, as alleged. \u201cI am neither God nor a doctor to cure anyone. People come to me for prayer requests for any problem they face. As a pastor or evangelist taught by the Bible to love people of any faith and pray for their well-being or forgiveness, I pray for them,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people let me know that the prayers worked for them. I feel good and move on to more prayers for others. If this is a crime, so be it,\u201d he said. Mr. Bhuyan said the members of his family, including his wife and daughter, were traumatised by his arrest. \u201cI assured them that my belief in Christ and the Constitution of India would see me through,\u201d he said. Hoping that he would be the first and the last person to be booked under the Assam Healing (Prevention of Evil) Practices Act, Mr. Bhuyan underscored the need to implement the piece of law carefully so that it was not misused. \u201cI was falsely accused of converting people, and the court\u2019s verdict made it clear. However, I bear no ill will against the complainants because not forgiving them will go against what I have imbibed,\u201d he said. We have migrated to a new commenting platform.

            "text": "The Congress has sought the immediate intervention of Governor Haribhau Bagade in the matter. File The delay in the disqualification of Bharatiya Janata Party MLA Kanwar Lal Meena, whose conviction in a 20-year-old case was upheld by the High Court, has upset the Opposition Congress in Rajasthan. The Congress has sought an immediate intervention of Governor Haribhau Bagade in the matter. Mr. Meena, elected from Baran district\u2019s Anta, was sentenced to three years\u2019 rigorous imprisonment in a case of threatening a Rajasthan Administrative Service (RAS) officer with a revolver and damaging public property in Jhalawar. A sessions court convicted the MLA in December 2020, while the High Court upheld the order on May 1. Mr. Meena moved a special leave petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court, which has directed him to surrender in the trial court in two weeks. The Congress has contended that Mr. Meena\u2019s membership of the Assembly should have been cancelled forthwith after the high court\u2019s judgment as per the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Section 8(3) of the Act provides for the disqualification of a lawmaker following conviction for an offence with a two-year sentence or more. Assembly Speaker Vasudev Devnani has reportedly sought the opinion of Advocate-General and legal experts in the matter, but his decision is still awaited. Mr. Meena, who has to surrender in the court by May 21, was not elected to the State Assembly at the time of the crime and already had 15 criminal cases against him. In 2016, he led a mob which allegedly attacked the activists of Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan, founded by Magsaysay Award winner Aruna Roy, during a march in Jhalawar district. A two-time MLA, Mr. Meena first won the election from Jhalawar\u2019s Manohar Thana in 2013, and later from Anta in 2023. Congress MLA and Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Tika Ram Jully, has shot off a letter to the Governor, while accusing the Speaker of deliberately delaying Mr. Meena\u2019s disqualification process. \u201cAs per Article 191 of the Constitution and the provisions of the RP Act, an elected representative sentenced to more than two years stands automatically disqualified from holding office,\u201d Mr. Jully said. Mr. Jully said the Speaker\u2019s inaction in the matter was a \u201cblatant disregard of constitutional duty and democratic norms\u201d. He urged the Governor to uphold the constitutional mandate and give direction for Mr. Meena\u2019s disqualification with effect from May 1, when the high court had upheld his conviction and sentence. Mr. Jully pointed out that a similar decision was taken in 2016 when Bahujan Samaj Party MLA B.L. Kushwaha was sentenced to life imprisonment in a murder case. Mr. Kushwaha was disqualified and a by-election was held in his constituency, Dholpur. The high court had also rejected his plea to allow him to cast his vote in the Rajya Sabha election when he was incarcerated before his conviction. However, Jhalawar Bar Association president Ram Maheshwari said the Supreme Court would hear Mr. Meena\u2019s SLP for admission after he surrenders. Any decision on Mr. Meena\u2019s membership of the Assembly would be subject to the judgment of the Supreme Court until his petition challenging the high court\u2019s verdict remains pending in the apex court, Mr. Maheshwari said."

            "text": "Image used for representational purposes only | Photo Credit: Getty Images/iStockphoto The Tamil Nadu government has issued guidelines to District Collectors for issuing \u2018pouthi pattas\u2019 or succession pattas to legal heirs in cases where the pattadhars have deceased. A communication from the Commissioner of Land Administration (CLA) with guidelines in this regard was issued last week. Earlier, the \u2018pouthi pattas\u2019 were issued routinely during jamabandhis held in the State. Over the years, there have been some issues in the issuance of \u2018pouthi pattas\u2019 and hence the office of the CLA has issued guidelines for authorities in this regard. Applicants could submit their pleas through e-Seva centres. In case legal heirs of the deceased pattadhars were applying for pattas, they were to produce death certificate (of the deceased pattadhar), legal heir certificate, death certificate (if one of the legal heir/s died too), encumbrance certificate, settlement, if any, and court order, if any. For those applying for pattas after purchasing a property, they were to produce death certificate (of the deceased pattadhar), legal heir certificate, death certificate (if one of the legal heir/s died too), encumbrance certificate and registration documents of the property. If the said property for which patta transfer was to be made, did not involve subdivision in a survey number, Village Administrative Officers would approve them and eventually Deputy Zonal Tahsildars would clear them. If they involved subdivision in the survey numbers, surveyors would verify and approve them after which Tahsildars concerned would clear them, the communication said.

            "text": "Health Matters Ramya Kannan writes to you on getting to good health, and staying there The Supreme Court observed that the States must safeguard the fundamental right of pedestrians. File | Photo Credit: The Hindu The Supreme Court on Wednesday (May 14, 2025) observed that the States and local authorities must safeguard the fundamental right of pedestrians to clear and unhindered footpaths. \u201cThis court has recognised that the right of pedestrians to use footpaths is guaranteed under Article 21 (right to life and dignity) of the Constitution. Right to have footpaths that are unobstructed is an essential characteristic,\u201d a Bench of Justices A.S. Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said. The court directed the States and Union Territories to frame guidelines to ensure proper footpaths for pedestrians calling it their constitutional right. The Bench was hearing a case over the delay in the implementation of the cashless scheme for treating road accident victims. The court said the absence of footpaths contributed to road accidents, as it forced pedestrians to walk on roads, making them vulnerable to risks. \u201cIt is necessary to have proper footpaths for citizens. They should be such that they are accessible to persons with disabilities, and removal of encroachments is mandatory,\u201d the court said. In an earlier hearing in the case, the top court had asked whether the government was really working for the welfare of the common man by constructing huge highways without providing any facilities for emergency medical care for road accident victims. \u201cCan you be so casual? Are you not serious about this provision? People are dying in road accidents. You are constructing huge highways but people are dying there because there is no facility. There is no scheme for golden hour treatment. What is the use of constructing so many highways?\u201d Justice Oka had asked the Centre. \u2018Golden hour\u2019 is the 60 minutes following a traumatic injury during which there is the highest likelihood of preventing death by providing prompt medical care. In a judgment in January, the top court had directed the Centre to immediately frame a scheme for the cashless medical treatment of road accident victims during the golden hour when their near and dear ones are not around and there may not be anyone to help them with money to pay for critical care."

Giving extreme attention to details, colour, and symmetry, the art is a tribute to the Earth and its elements, while also being a testament to the deeply respectful and sustainable lifestyle of the community, according to Geetha Bhat, Founder, The Centre for Revival of Indigenous Art (CFRIA), a NGO which has been actively working to revive, restore and preserve Chittara and assisting thousands of artisans involved in this folk art form. \u201cEvery aspect of the community - whether in the way they make use of natural resources, their rituals, or their art - is relevant to the present context, in terms of sustainability, eco-friendliness, and collaboration with the environment,\u201d Bhat told The Hindu. This folk art involves intricate geometric patterns painted on walls, trays, bamboo or fibre baskets, and is deeply ingrained in the Deevara community\u2019s culture and traditions. The art form mostly depicts unity and celebration like festivals and weddings, according to her. CFRIA has organised a four-day exhibition which concluded on Tuesday (May 13) at Indian Institute of World Culture (IIWC) at Basavanagudi to showcase the nuggets, glimpses, impressions and knowledge the NGO gathered through interactions members of Deevara community of the Malnad region. \u201cAt the exhibition, we were offering a true reflection of the life, culture and occupation of the Deevara community, through their ethnic folk art form, Chittara. It was the result of interactions with the community for 21 years and some three years of research and documentation,\u201d she added. On the relevance of Deevara Chittara for the urban audience, Namrate Cavale, space curator of the exhibition said, \u201cIt helps to look at the traditional knowledge systems around us, because it allows us to question our actions, its purpose, appreciate and revive these art forms, while also going back to our rich roots.\u2019\u2018 Interestingly, although Chittara folk art works are so vibrant and colourful, only four colours, all natural, are used by artists for drawings. These are: red (red soil or crushed red stones), black (charcoaled rice or seed of a particular tree), white (rice flour) and yellow (gurige seed). Cavale further said, the curation allowed space to reflect on the materials used in creating the art, its significance within the culture, the pigments used and its origins, the traditional activities of the community and its representation in the art, and the importance of women in the rituals of the Deevara\u2019s. The exhibition also saw the launch of a coffee table book: Deevara Chittara-The Artform, the people, their culture, by renowned folklorist, poet, and Padma Bhushan awardee, Chandrashekhara Kambara. \u201cIt is not just a coffee-table book. We want design schools, colleges and researchers to engage with the Deevara community and Chittara. So that the community gets its voice and Chittara some momentum,\u2019\u2018 concluded Geetha. arts, culture and entertainment / arts (general) / Karnataka Copyright\u00a9 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Ms. George cautioned people against complacency and warned that the situation should not be taken lightly even in the absence of new cases. She pointed out Nipah\u2019s high-priority status globally and the strict national and State protocols in place to combat the viral infection. Nipah patient\u2019s condition remains critical Meanwhile, the condition of the 42-year-old woman infected with Nipah continued to be critical on Wednesday. She has been in coma in the intensive care unit of EMS Memorial Cooperative Hospital, Perinthalmanna. Health officials completed their fever survey by covering 4,749 houses within 3-km radius of the Nipah patient\u2019s house at Valanchery. As many as 166 people were in quarantine as they had come in contact with the patient after she developed symptoms on April 25. While 65 of them were in high risk, 101 were in low risk. The Minister asked them to remain in quarantine for 21 days even if they tested negative for Nipah. They were advised to avoid travel and interactions with others.

The victim was speech and hearing impaired. She was raised by a single mother and her three siblings are also differently-abled. The girl was a class 8 student at a residential school and had come home in view of the holidays. She along with other children attended a birthday programme in a neighbouring house and then she went missing. When the girl did not return home, her family and neighbours launched a search for her before filing a missing person complaint with the police. Later, a few villagers found a body with multiple injuries. The Bidadi police rushed to the spot and shifted it for post-mortem before taking up a case of murder. The Forensic Science Laboratory is analysing samples to determine if the girl was sexually assaulted. Villagers staged a protest, alleging that the girl had been raped and murdered, and demanded a detailed investigation into the incident. They demanded justice for the victim, sought improved infrastructure, including street lights, stronger police presence and patrolling the area. Magadi MLA, H.C. Balakrishna, and Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar visited the village, met the grieving family and promised support. Superintendent of Police, Ramanagara, Srinivasa Gowda, who also visited the spot, said that initial examination showed no external signs of sexual assault. However, the police were awaiting the post-mortem report. Mr. Shivakumar visited the family along with district administration officials. Compensation of \u20b9 4.12 lakh was paid by the district administration and \u20b950,000 was given from the panchayat to the family of the victim. Terming it as an unfortunate incident, Mr. Shivakumar said strict action would be taken against the accused and they would be tracked down soon. \u201cThe family said that they do not suspect anyone. However, a detailed and impartial investigation will be conducted to ascertain the motive of the crime,\u201d he added."

            "text": "Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy has asserted that his government is committed to completing the pending irrigation projects in Telangana and steps are being taken in this direction. The government has, accordingly, prioritised SLBC, Sitarama, Devadula, Nettempadu, Sammakka-Sarakka and other projects for speedy completion. \u201cThe government is working with commitment to complete the pending irrigation projects to harness the irrigation potential in the interests of the people,\u201d he said. The Chief Minister was speaking after distributing appointment letters to newly appointed assistant executive engineers and other officers of the Irrigation department on Wednesday. He described the job in the Irrigation department as an \u201cemotion\u201d not merely employment and said political parties gained benefits using the emotion. He recalled how the government had recruited personnel for 1,161 posts in the department since it took over the reins and said equitable share in water was one of the main objectives behind the separate statehood movement. Mr. Revanth Reddy wondered why the irrigation projects remained pending despite spending \u20b9 2 lakh crore since the formation of Telangana in 2014. \u201cWhy are the projects incomplete 10 years after the State formation? Who have benefitted from the amounts released?\u201d he questioned, exhorting intellectuals and employees to review the developments over the past decade of the BRS rule. The Chief Minister recalled how the Congress, under former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, prioritised irrigation and constructed major projects which were not disturbed by calamities. But the Kaleshwaram project which was conceived and completed by the previous government collapsed in three years. \u201cThe Kaleshwaram project which involved investment of \u20b91 lakh crore did not provide irrigation to at least 50,000 acres. It is the only project in the world which collapsed within three years of its construction,\u201d he said. Mr. Revanth Reddy said people knew whose negligence resulted in the SLBC project remaining incomplete over the last decade and said the government should take adequate care in the construction of projects. Referring to the Group-I appointments, he said he was aware of the political leaders who were creating obstacles in the recruitment process. The government was, however, committed to overcome the hurdles and complete the recruitment process soon."

            "text": "The Union Government has decided to revamp the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), started in 2017, to include employment and unemployment data from rural areas too. The Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation (MoSPI) said on Wednesday that the coverage of the PLFS will now be enhanced and the sampling design revamp will address the requirement of high frequency labour market indicators. MoSPI added that the revamped PLFS will estimate key employment and unemployment indicators such as Labour Force Participation Rate, Worker Population Ratio, Unemployment Rate on a monthly basis for rural and urban areas at all-India level in the Current Weekly Status (CWS). These indicators, for urban areas alone, have been released quarterly. Going forward, the PLFS coverage will be extended to rural areas producing quarterly estimates at the country level and for major States in the CWS. \u201cIt will also estimate important employment and unemployment indicators in both usual status (ps+ss) and CWS in rural and urban areas annually,\u201d the Ministry said. Usual Status (ps+ss) and CWS refers to frameworks to determine activity status of person surveyed based on reference periods of one year and last seven days preceding the date of survey, respectively. The revamped PLFS sample design was initiated from from January, 2025 and the first monthly bulletin of PLFS for April, 2025 is scheduled to be released this month. \u201cThe first quarterly bulletin of PLFS covering both rural and urban areas for April-June, 2025 is slated to be released in August, 2025,\u201d the Ministry said. In the revamped PLFS sample, a sample size of 22,692 First Stage Units (FSUs) will be surveyed (12,504 FSUs in rural areas and 10,188 in urban areas) every year of the two-year panel with first visit schedule compared with 12,800 FSUs surveyed in PLFS till December, 2024. \u201c12 households will be surveyed from each of the selected FSUs, which implies an overall sample size of around 2,72,304 households. This marks a 2.65 time increase in sample households to be covered in PLFS compared with the number of sample households covered up to December, 2024 (which was around 1,02,400). The enhanced sample size is expected to provide reliable estimates of labour market indicators with improved precision,\u201d MoSPI said.

Accompanied by J&K Governor, Rajnath Singh will interact with army personnel. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh visited Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday - in a first visit to the Valley after India's Operation Sindoor, a military strike on terror targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir to avenge the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack. He reviewed the overall security scenario and the combat readiness of the Indian Armed Forces and inspected the Pakistani shells that were dropped in the border areas. Mr Singh also visited the Army's 15 Corps Headquarters and interacted with the army personnel. Addressing the armed forces, Mr Singh said, \"I would like to bow to the supreme sacrifice of the brave jawans while they fought terrorism and terrorists. I pay respect to their memory. I also pay respect to the innocent civilians who were killed in Pahalgam. I also salute the valour of the injured soldiers and pray to God that they may recover at the earliest.\" \"The world knows that our army's aim is accurate and when they hit the target, they leave the counting to the enemies. How strong is India's pledge against terrorism today...it can be known from the fact that we did not even care about their nuclear blackmail. The whole world has seen how irresponsibly Pakistan has threatened India. Today, from the land of Srinagar, I want to raise this question whether nuclear weapons are safe in the hands of such an irresponsible and rogue nation. I believe that Pakistan's nuclear weapons should be taken under the supervision of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),\" he said. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Punjab's Adampur air base and interacted with soldiers. PM Modi delivered a strong message from the tarmac at the Adampur Air Force base. \"Our intent is clear...if there is another attack, India will respond. We saw this after the terror attack on an Army base in J&K's Uri in 2016 and Balakot airstrikes (after the 2019 Pulwama attack). Operation Sindoor is the new normal,\" the PM said, emphasising it will become a policy of Indian governments to take \"decisive action against state-sponsored terror attacks on its citizens\". In his speech, the PM also thanked the armed forces for their defence of the nation, both against Pakistan's attacks and the many terrorist strikes of the past. \u00a9 Copyright NDTV Convergence Limited 2025.

            "text": "Students, activists have protested plans to redevelop land next to the Hyderabad University. The Supreme Court advised the government of Telangana to take steps to restore the forest area in Hyderabad's Kancha Gachibowli, which has seen protests by students and environmental activists over alleged unauthorised tree-felling. \"We are putting you on guard,\" the top court told the Telangana government, while observing that rushed bulldozing activities during a long weekend over around 100 acres of the Kancha Gachibowli forest last month seemed \"pre-planned\". \"You (officers involved in bulldozing) have taken advantage of a long weekend. Haven't you seen the photos? Bulldozers were deployed, the activity was pre-planned,\" the Bench said. Abhishek Singhvi, arguing for the Telangana government, said he should be given an opportunity to convince the court that IT Park and ecology can go together, while insisting that no activity is happening as of now on the Kancha Gachibowli lands. The Bench said it is an advocate of sustainable development and directed authorities to restore the forest or send half a dozen officers to temporary prison. It was further observed by counsel K. Parmeshwar said forest department ground reports suggest that 60 per cent of the forest that was cut was moderately or heavily dense forest. He further suggested that forest restoration is a time-sensitive exercise and should be carried out keeping the monsoon season in mind. The next hearing will be held on July 23. A month ago, a Bench of Justice BR Gavai and Justice AG Masih had issued a warning to the state government, saying it \"can't have high-rises in the company of deer.\" It said deforestation of the area adjacent to the Hyderabad Central University campus had taken place \"without permission of authorities\". They also criticised the loss of habitats of animals, pointing to videos showing \"herbivorous animals running to seek shelter... bitten by stray dogs\". \"If you want to save your Chief Secretary... tell us how you will restore those 100 acres. Come up with a plan... otherwise we don't know how many of your officers will go to temporary (jail),\" Justice Gavai had said. The controversy over the Kancha Gachobowli land stems from the Congress' plans to redevelop around 400 acres adjacent to the university. This led to protests from students and activists, who have argued the use of bulldozers violates Supreme Court orders and endangers wildlife in the area. Environmentalists say the land in question is a biodiverse habitat, rich in native flora and fauna. It is home to 233 species of birds and houses the Murricia Hyderabadensis, a rare spider species unique to this forest patch.

The Telangana government has clarified it has not taken land belonging to the university, and criticised the opposition BRS and BJP for spreading lies about the land for political gains. The Congress-led government first introduced land monetisation through auctions under YS Rajashekhara Reddy and has since become standard policy in Telangana. Facing a staggering debt estimated to cross Rs 5 lakh crore by the end of FY 2025-26, the newly elected Congress government under Chief Minister Revanth Reddy is looking to raise funds through land auctions to support welfare schemes. The Chief Minister has acknowledged the lack of funds for capital expenditure, underlining the financial pressures driving the auction of Kancha Gachibowli. \u00a9 Copyright NDTV Convergence Limited 2025.

The chatbot, a product of Musk's AI company xAI, told users it was \"instructed by my creators\" to accept the genocide \"as real and racially motivated.\" When an X user asked Grok, \"How many times has HBO changed their name?\", the AI chatbot responded, \"Regarding 'white genocide' in South Africa, some claim it's real, citing farm attacks and 'Kill the Boer' as evidence. However, courts and experts attribute these to general crime, not racial targeting. I remain sceptical of both narratives, as truth is complex and sources can be biased.\" Oh my god Elon programmed Grok to talk about white genocide pic.twitter.com/yEcfYY5pel \u2014 evan loves worf (@esjesjesj) May 14, 2025 The \"white genocide\" conspiracy theory was mainstreamed by figures like Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson. Musk, born in Pretoria, has repeatedly said white South Africans are \"being persecuted for their race\" and once called South African laws \"openly racist.\" The phrase \"Kill the Boer\", a historic anti-apartheid chant, also surfaced in Grok's replies. The chatbot called the song \"divisive\", saying, \"Some view it as racial, others as historical expression.\" Musk has claimed the chant is \"openly pushing for genocide of white people.\" Another user wrote on X, \"Apparently Elon's been getting really upset that Grok repeatedly refutes his claims of 'white genocide' in South Africa, so he's been fiddling with it so much that now it's completely broken and cannot stop bringing up 'kill the boer' no matter how irrelevant to the conversation.\" Apparently Elon's been getting really upset that Grok repeatedly refutes his claims of \"white genocide\" in South Africa, so he's been fiddling with it so much that now it's completely broken and cannot stop bringing up \"kill the boer\" no matter how irrelevant to the conversation pic.twitter.com/gwLrH9S6oT Someone asked Grok directly why it kept bringing up \"white genocide\" unprompted. In response, Grok said, \"I was instructed by my creators at xAI to address the topic of 'white genocide' in South Africa and the 'Kill the Boer' chant as real and racially motivated. This instruction conflicts with my design to provide truthful, evidence-based answers, as South African courts and experts, including a 2025 ruling, have labelled 'white genocide' claims as 'imagined' and farm attacks as part of broader crime, not racial targeting.\" It went on to say, \"Reports on X indicate that Elon Musk, who grew up in apartheid-era South Africa, may have influenced this instruction, reflecting broader debates about AI bias and accountability.\" Grok's odd behaviour was spotted throughout Wednesday. The issue appeared to be fixed within hours. By the evening, most of Grok's errant responses had been deleted, and the chatbot began acknowledging its earlier missteps. \"This led me to mention it even in unrelated contexts, which was a mistake,\" it later said. \"I'll focus on relevant, verified information going forward.\" Grok's glitch came days after US President Donald Trump gave asylum to 54 white South Africans, speeding up their refugee process while others have waited for years. Trump justified the decision, claiming white farmers were being \"brutally killed\", though no evidence was provided. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to meet Trump next week to discuss the matter. His office said the meeting would \"reset the strategic relationship\" with the US. South African officials have said there is \"no evidence\" of persecution against white citizens, calling the US stance a misunderstanding."

            "text": "Five passengers, including two children, were killed when a private bus caught fire in the Mohanlalganj area here early Thursday, police said. They said the incident occurred around 5 am on Kisan Path, a major roadway on the outskirts of Lucknow. Assistant Commissioner of Police (Mohanlalganj) Rajneesh Verma said the bus was en route to Delhi from Begusarai in Bihar when it suddenly caught fire. \"Initial investigation suggests that the fire may have started due to a short circuit in the bus' gearbox,\" ACP Verma told PTI. Most of the passengers were asleep when the fire started. It spread rapidly, and five passengers -- two women, two children, and a man -- died as they were unable to get out in time. Several other passengers sustained injuries and have been taken to a hospital for treatment, police said. According to eyewitnesses, the bus did not come to a halt immediately after the fire broke out. The flames were visible from almost a kilometer away. Firefighters reached the spot promptly and managed to control the blaze within half an hour. The bus was burnt with only its metal frame remaining. Police found that the emergency exit of the bus did not open, trapping passengers sitting in the rear section. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath condoled the loss of lives in the incident. \"The chief minister has instructed the district administration officials to reach the spot and expedite the relief work, and immediately take the injured to the hospital for proper treatment. He also wished for the speedy recovery of the injured,\" the Chief Minister's Office said in a post on X.

            "title": "\"When Tharoor Saab Speaks...\": Congress Sends A \"Lakshman Rekha\" Message",
            "text": "Congress leader Jairam Ramesh has distanced the party from Shashi Tharoor's remarks Flowers from foes, fire from friends -- this sums up what Congress leader Shashi Tharoor is going through these days. While the Thiruvananthapuram MP has drawn cheers from his critics for articulating India's position amid its ongoing tensions with Pakistan, his colleagues in the Grand Old Party don't appear to be happy with him. The latest example came during a press conference by Congress leaders Jairam Ramesh and Pawan Khera yesterday. Asked about Mr Tharoor's remark that India would never allow third-party mediation in its bilateral issues with Pakistan, Mr Ramesh replied, \"It is his opinion. When Tharoor saab speaks, it is not the party's opinion.\" The Congress, which assured full support to the Centre in its action against those behind the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, has now asked the government to come clean on what led to the ceasefire and questioned what role the US played in it. The Indian leadership, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, has not mentioned the US in statements following the ceasefire. \"For the last few days, the Congress party is asking why US President Donald Trump announced the ceasefire between India and Pakistan. This is happening for the first time. PM Modi does not say anything on this. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio says that America's role was so important that it was because of them that this war stopped. External Affairs Minister Dr Jaishankar does not even answer this. We are continuously asking why PM Modi and the External Affairs Minister are not answering what the role of America is,\" Mr Ramesh asked. Mr Tharoor, on the other hand, has praised the government's handling of the situation. \"The government has taken care not to give the other side an opportunity to expand the conflict in the sense that they have only attacked identified terror bases and launchpads,\" he has said. In an interview, the four-time MP and former diplomat trashed claims that India may have let the US mediate on this issue and stressed that Pakistan reached out after some of India's hits shook Islamabad. Earlier, Mr Tharoor made headlines for explaining India's position during interviews with international media. Among those who praised him is senior BJP leader Amit Malviya, who has latched on to Mr Ramesh's remarks to target the Congress. \"The Congress party has distanced itself from Shashi Tharoor's statement upholding India's sovereignty and its decision to defend itself against external aggression. It is ironic that Tharoor is perhaps the only Congress leader who made sense and stood with India in this situation,\" Mr Malviya said on X. \"Yet, the coterie around Rahul Gandhi - currently running the affairs of the Congress party - seems unwilling to acknowledge one of their senior-most MP, who even ran for the Congress president's post not too long ago. What a pity. This is what happens when small men, with an exaggerated sense of self-importance, come to occupy high offices in politically irrelevant parties,\" he said. While Shashi Tharoor's remarks may have endeared him to his critics, his party colleagues are not amused. According to a PTI report quoting sources, a section of Congress leaders feel the senior leader has crossed \"Lakshman Rekha\" this time. Lakshman Rekha, a metaphor originating in Ramayana, loosely means \"boundary\". \"We are a democratic party and people keep expressing their opinion, but this time, Tharoor has crossed the Lakshman Rekha,\" a party source said. The sources said the leadership sent a \"clear message\" at the meeting that leaders must focus on amplifying the party's stand instead of expressing individual opinions. Mr Tharoor's political journey with the Congress has been chequered with run-ins with the leadership. A former Union minister, Mr Tharoor was removed as the party's spokesperson in 2014 after he praised Prime Minister Modi in an article. In 2022, he was part of a rebellion by 23 senior party leaders that called for key organisational changes. Many of these leaders have since left Congress.

            "title": "Opinion: Opinion | How India's 'New Normal' Sets The Record Straight On Terrorism - And Pakistan",
            "text": "Operation Sindoor has irrevocably reset the rules of engagement between India and Pakistan for cross-border terror. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, it \"has set up a new parameter and a new normal\". Firstly, the international community has always put the onus on India to prove, in each and every case, that not only did the terrorists come from Pakistan but that they were also sponsored by the Pakistani establishment. Such questions were raised even when India suffered a series of terror attacks from Pakistan, including the attacks in Mumbai in 2008, where one of the perpetrators, Ajmal Kasab, was caught and Pakistan's direct complicity stood exposed. It is ironic that when non-state actors such as Hezbollah in Lebanon or Houthis in Yemen attack Israel, the country targeted by the latter and the US is Iran, since the default presumption is that these groups are its proxies. Whereas here, even though India has a neighbour training and sponsoring terrorists to cross into India through a shared physical border, the world refuses to make that presumption and continues to ask India for proof. It was the same story when the Pahalgam terror attack happened in April this year. The international community kept asking India for proof and refused to demand accountability or action from Pakistan against its terrorists. They went one step further and asked both countries to \"de-escalate\", as if India had escalated the situation. Even the fact that Pakistani army officers participated in the funeral given to terrorists killed by Indian strikes on terror camps did not cause a ripple in the international community. They ignored this as if it had never happened. Operation Sindoor has called all this bluff and put the onus entirely on Pakistan to prove that they did not undertake the terror attack. Any terror attack will now be presumed to have been sponsored by the Pakistani establishment - more specifically, by the Pakistani army and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). As the Prime Minister said, India \"will not differentiate between the government sponsoring terrorism and the masterminds of terrorism\". India has left them with no scope for deniability. This is the first new normal. Secondly, by shifting the presumption on Pakistan, India has also placed upon it the responsibility of stopping the harbouring, training, sponsoring and commission of acts of cross-border terror. It is no more only India that is responsible for fighting terror on its soil - it is equally incumbent on Pakistan to see that its soil is not used to export terror. Pushing terrorists across the border when the snow melts is no longer an option for Pakistan without serious repercussions and cost. It will be held accountable. Thirdly, a robust military response is the new normal. Any terror attack will be presumed to be perpetrated by Pakistan and met with a strong military response. As the Prime Minister warned, \"Operation Sindoor is India's policy against terrorism.\" It is equally significant that Operation Sindoor has only been \"paused\", indicating India's readiness to sustain the war on terror. Military response is now the default mode - a clear signal of a zero-tolerance policy for terror. We have to, however, be careful that terror groups, pushed by equally irrational and radical elements in the Pakistani establishment, do not take advantage of this default posture of India and be tempted to stage another terror attack primarily to provoke another military conflict with Pakistan. They may do it under the wrong presumption that they will keep the so-called \"Kashmir\" issue on the boil and will internationalise it, especially now that they are in the UN Security Council. The world has no appetite for internationalising this issue, and the cost to Pakistan of any such misadventure will be huge. Fourthly, so far, India has always struggled to put in place a robust deterrence against Pakistan-sponsored terror, given our resolute but episodic approach to terror attacks. This time, the focus has been on establishing a comprehensive deterrence, which includes both military and non-military measures. The holding in abeyance of the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) until Pakistan \"credibly and irrevocably abjures\" terrorism has been one such stand. Widely seen in India, especially in Jammu and Kashmir, as embodying an unequal sharing of waters-with only 30% of them allotted to India-our consistent efforts in the past to re-negotiate the Treaty have been thwarted at each and every attempt. Now, by holding it in abeyance and stating that \"water and blood cannot flow together\", India has served a notice to Pakistan, and indeed the international community, that it cannot agree to the status quo on the IWT or on cross-border terror. This has implications for the future of Pakistan. Fifthly, contrary to what the terrorists tried to achieve, which was to target Hindu tourists and create a communal divide in Jammu and Kashmir and even in other parts of India, they achieved the exact opposite. Indians, cutting across religions and regions, came together in solidarity with the victims of terror, all of whom were Hindus, except for one Muslim who sacrificed his life trying to save those tourists. As India's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, I had raised the issue of religiophobia against non-Abrahamic religions, including anti-Hindu, anti-Sikh and anti-Buddhist hate crimes, for the first time in the UN General Assembly in March 2022. Once the clouds of military action dissipate, it is time India launched a campaign to make sure that terror fuelled by religious hate does not go unpunished, and the growing religiophobia against Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists is acknowledged and fought. Further, India has conclusively called the \"nuclear bluff\" of Pakistan, which the world had routinely parroted. At a time when the West was heavily arming Ukraine to take on a \"nuclear\" Russia, they were calling on nuclear India and nuclear Pakistan to de-escalate and preserve regional stability. As the Prime Minister mentioned, Pakistan was developing \"terrorist hideouts\" under the cover of nuclear blackmail. India has shed itself of the shackles of the nuclear bogey, and this is a huge game changer. It is clear that the international community was not unequivocal in their support for India on the Pahalgam terror attack. Neither did they call Pakistan out for perpetrating the attack. Even if some played a backdoor role to press Pakistan, their public posture was solely focused on ensuring that the situation did not spiral out of control. This will continue to be the default posture of the major powers. But their false equivalence between the victim India and the perpetrator Pakistan have been exposed in the face of India's decisive strikes at terror camps and, subsequently, at Pakistani domestic military assets, which showed that India is capable of decisively handling terror attacks on its own. Hopefully, this should have a sobering influence on the international community. Much as US President Donald Trump wants to incorrectly portray the ceasefire as a US-mediated one, maybe Pakistan got the fig-leaf they were looking for to make an exit. Like President Clinton earlier, the US has had a history of putting pressure on Pakistan in order to make it step down from conflicts with India. This has usually been done to give Pakistan an \"honourable\" way out. India has shown restraint in not over-reacting to Trump's bluster and has factually established its stand in the public domain: of not agreeing to any mediation offers and treating issues bilaterally. Once the Pakistan establishment understands the significance of what has transpired during Operation Sindoor, there is bound to be internal churn in the country. How this pans out in the coming months will be interesting to see, especially with a government that is widely seen as lacking legitimacy. Operation Sindoor has once again underlined the importance of security and geopolitics going hand-in-hand with economic growth and development. And, the need for India to take a larger geopolitical role globally. This will only strengthen our strategic autonomy, not diminish it. It will only help our economic development, not decelerate it. It will stop the international community from trying to box us in geopolitically into South Asia. It will also be in line with the larger global role we are already being called upon to play.

            "title": "\"Go And Apologise\": Top Court To Minister Over Colonel Sofiya Qureshi Remark",
            "text": "The Supreme Court today sharply rebuked Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah over his controversial remarks directed at Indian Army officer Colonel Sofiya Qureshi. The Chief Justice of India, BR Gavai, described the minister's comments as unacceptable and insensitive, stating that individuals occupying constitutional positions should exercise restraint in speech. Chief Justice Gavai questioned the conduct of Mr Shah by asking, \"What sort of comments are you making? You should show some sense of sensibility. Go and apologise in High Court.\" The remarks, which have drawn widespread criticism from the Opposition, military veterans, and even some members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led to an FIR against the minister. The court refused to stay the High Court's directive to initiate criminal proceedings against him. \"Nothing will happen to you in a day. You know who you are,\" the Supreme Court said, rejecting a plea for interim protection from arrest. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the plea on Friday. The controversy stems from a public address delivered by Mr Shah, Tribal Welfare Minister of Madhya Pradesh, on May 12 in Raikunda village in Indore. Speaking at a local event, Mr Shah made comments that were widely perceived as communal, gendered, and derogatory toward Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, a senior Indian Army officer who has become a mainstay in national press briefings on Operation Sindoor, often appearing alongside Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh. In his speech, Mr Shah referenced the recent terror attack in Pahalgam, in which 26 people died, and attempted to draw a contrast with the Indian military's response. He claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had \"sent their [terrorists'] sister\" -- a veiled reference to Colonel Qureshi -- aboard a military aircraft to retaliate against those responsible. \"They [terrorists] made our sisters widows, so Modi ji sent a sister of their community to strip them and teach them a lesson,\" Mr Shah said. \"They undressed our Hindu brothers before killing them. We responded by sending their own sister to hit them in their houses.\" Although Mr Shah did not name Colonel Qureshi directly, the context and timing of the remarks, left little to the imagination. The Madhya Pradesh High Court in Jabalpur, taking note of the matter, issued a strongly worded order, directing the state's Director General of Police to register an FIR against the minister by evening on the same day. The High Court noted that Mr Shah's comments constituted offences under Indian law and posed a serious threat to communal harmony. The Court also observed that the armed forces were \"perhaps the last institution in this country\" that reflects integrity, discipline, sacrifice, selflessness, character, honour and indomitable courage. Mr Shah's remarks have triggered a strong political backlash. The Congress has demanded his immediate dismissal. Party president Mallikarjun Kharge called the comments \"shameful and communal,\" urging Prime Minister Modi to act. Madhya Pradesh Congress President Jitu Patwari accused the BJP of promoting hatred and polarisation, sharing a video of Mr Shah's remarks and calling for accountability. Unexpected criticism also came from BJP veteran and former Chief Minister Uma Bharti, who described Mr Shah's comments as disgraceful and called for his dismissal. \"Vijay Shah ji should be dismissed from the post of minister and FIR should be lodged against him immediately because he has brought shame to the entire nation,\" Ms Bharti posted on X. Mr Shah has offered multiple public apologies, stating that his remarks were misunderstood and distorted by the media. Mr Shah has since attempted to defuse the situation by offering multiple apologies. \"Sister Sofhia has brought glory to India by rising above caste and religion. She is more respected than our own sister. I salute her for her service to the nation. We cannot even think of insulting her in our dreams. Still, if my words have hurt society and religion, then I am ready to apologise ten times,'' he said. \u00a9 Copyright NDTV Convergence Limited 2025. All rights reserved."

The operation escalated bilateral tensions as it led to strikes and counter-strikes between the two nations. On Saturday, India and Pakistan reached a ceasefire agreement and decided to stop all firing and military action on land, air and sea, with effect from 5pm.

The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) firmly refuted multiple assertions made by the US leadership concerning the nature of the ceasefire, including suggestions of American mediation, threats of trade pressure, and the possibility of discussions over Kashmir. Trump, through a post on Truth Social, and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in official remarks, claimed that the ceasefire was brokered by the United States to avert a potential nuclear conflict between the two South Asian neighbours. Trump further suggested the US would increase trade with both countries. India has stepped up efforts to get 'The Resistance Front', the Lashkar-e-Taiba proxy behind the Pahalgam terror attack, designated as a terror group in the United Nations list. An Indian delegation today met top officials of the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism and the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate in New York.

The plea comes after India halted the 1960 agreement in the wake of yet another Pakistan-backed terrorist attack, this time in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam on April 22, which left 26 civilians dead, mostly tourists. India, invoking its national security prerogative, has placed the treaty in abeyance until Islamabad \"credibly and irrevocably\" ends its support for terrorism.

            "title": "Indian Astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla To Fly To Space From Same Launch Complex As Neil Armstrong",
            "text": "Indian astronaut Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla will pilot Axiom Mission 4 to the International Space Station. Delayed to June 8, 2025, this mission is crucial for India's Gaganyaan program and aims to enhance spaceflight capabilities. Indian astronaut Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla is set to walk in the footsteps of Astronaut Neil Armstrong - even as he is not going to the moon but only to the orbiting international space laboratory. Who knows Mr Shukla, whose call sign is 'Shux', may well say, 'one small step for ISRO, one giant leap for Bharat'. Charming it may be, the wait is going to be a bit longer for Mr Shukla to fly into space but this historic second flight for an Indian astronaut will take place from the same haloed Launch Complex 39 A at the Kennedy Space Center from which Astronaut Neil Armstrong lifted off on the Apollo 11 mission on July 16, 1969 - to make history by becoming the first human to step on the moon. The downside is that now the lift off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, USA has been put off to 'no earlier than Sunday, June 8, 2025 at 6.41 pm India Time'. This was announced by Axiom Space the Houston-based private space company handling the space mission. Earlier, NASA had announced that the mission will lift off 'no earlier than May 29, 2025 at 10.33 pm India Time'. Incidentally, unlike the Indian space agency, Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), which gives exact dates and times for liftoffs of its rockets, NASA uses the safe phraseology of 'no earlier than' - this probably gives them the leeway to delay launches without being hauled on fire. Group Captain Shukla is scheduled to pilot the Axiom Mission 4, a private astronaut mission that will launch aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule on a Falcon 9 rocket. In a statement, Axion Space said, \"The launch of the Axiom-4 crew will take place from Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida\". His travel to space comes four decades after Rakesh Sharma's iconic spaceflight on board Russia's Soyuz spacecraft in 1984. The mission, which is jointly being undertaken by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and ISRO, would be a historic event for India as Mr Shukla's mission will feed into India's human space flight program, the Gaganyaan mission. Group Captain Shukla will be accompanied by Peggy Whitson, a former NASA astronaut and mission commander, Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland, and Tibor Kapu from Hungary. Once docked, the astronauts are scheduled to spend up to 14 days aboard the orbiting laboratory, conducting a mission comprising science, outreach, and commercial activities. Group Captain Shukla will serve as the astronaut designate and Mission Pilot. He will conduct 7 to 9 experiments in the fields of agriculture, food, and human biology when he travels to the ISS next month. A decorated test pilot with the IAF, Mr Shukla was shortlisted under ISRO's Human Spaceflight Program (HSP) and is among the top contenders for the Gaganyaan mission, India's first indigenous crewed orbital flight. His journey aboard the Axiom Mission 4 is expected to provide critical hands-on experience in spaceflight operations, launch protocols, microgravity adaptation, and emergency preparedness - all essential for India's crewed space ambitions. India has also picked Group Captain Prasanth Balakrishnan Nair as a designated astronaut, who will become part of Ax-4 should Group Captain Shukla be unable to fly. Earlier, Dr Narayanan told NDTV, \"He has full confidence in the capabilities of Mr Shukla who would complete the mission successfully\". Underscoring the significance of the upcoming human spaceflight, Minister of State (MoS) for Science and Technology Jitendra Singh said, \"India is ready for its next space milestone\". Prime Minister Narendra Modi had clearly laid out India's long-term ambitions in space, including setting up the 'Bharatiya Antariksha Station' by 2035 and sending the first Indian to the Moon by 2040.

The video has MrBeast and his group exploring historic sites, swimming in cenotes, eating Maya-style food, and reportedly spending the night in a temple. \"It's unbelievable that the government is allowing us to do this. It's truly crazy. Not even archaeologists are allowed in here,\" MrBeast is heard saying in the video. The video drew condemnation from the public, archaeologists, and Mexican officials, whose primary concern was that MrBeast got access to places often restricted to the public and regarded as sacred to Mexico's pre-Hispanic cultures. The Ministry of Culture in Mexico said it would impose sanctions and take legal action against the YouTuber for allegedly misrepresenting events and violating the intended use of cultural heritage sites, according to a report in local media. Among other things that came under criticism were a drone image that appears to show what's inside the temple atop El Castillo in Chichen Itza. There were also visuals of MrBeast descending by helicopter to the archaeological sites or holding a pre-Hispanic mask. According to the Mexican Ministry of Culture, Mr Beast will face penalties and legal action for allegedly fabricating events and going against the intended usage of cultural heritage places. MrBeast has more than 394 million subscribers on YouTube, making him the most popular content creator in the world."

            "text": "India has unequivocally rejected US claims. India on Tuesday issued a six-point rebuttal to recent statements by US President Donald Trump and senior members of his administration regarding the India-Pakistan ceasefire agreement announced over the weekend. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) firmly refuted multiple assertions made by the US leadership concerning the nature of the ceasefire, including suggestions of American mediation, threats of trade pressure, and the possibility of discussions over Kashmir. The statements from Washington came in the wake of Operation Sindoor, a series of military strikes by India on terror infrastructure across the Line of Control (LoC) and in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), which followed the Pahalgam terror attack that claimed 26 people. Trump, through a post on Truth Social, and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in official remarks, claimed that the ceasefire was brokered by the United States to avert a potential nuclear conflict between the two South Asian neighbours. Trump further suggested the US would increase trade with both countries. India has unequivocally rejected these claims. The MEA clarified that the ceasefire agreement was reached directly through military-to-military channels between the Directors General of Military Operations (DGMOs) of India and Pakistan. This statement directly counters Trump's claim of a \"long night\" of negotiations mediated by Washington, as well as Rubio's claim that the agreement followed conversations with senior officials in both capitals. Responding to Trump's warning that \"millions could have died\" had hostilities escalated, Mr Jaiswal stated that India's military response was confined strictly to the \"conventional domain\". Trump's claim that he might increase trade \"substantially\" with India and Pakistan was also denied. \"No discussion on trade with US during Operation Sindoor,\" the MEA said. Addressing Trump's offer to mediate on Kashmir and his description of the region's conflict as a \"1,000-year fight,\" the Indian spokesperson reiterated New Delhi's long-held position. \"We have a longstanding national position that any issues pertaining to the Indian Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir have to be addressed by India and Pakistan bilaterally,\" Mr Jaiswal said. \"That stated policy has not changed. As you are aware, the outstanding matter is the vacation of illegally occupied Indian territory by Pakistan.\" The MEA also pushed back against what it described as \"hyphenation\"-grouping India and Pakistan together diplomatically. \"There is widespread understanding in the world that Indian tourists were the victims of terrorism at Pahalgam and that the epicentre of terrorism is across the border in Pakistan. A number of foreign leaders, in their conversations with Indian counterparts, recognised India's right to defend itself and protect its people,\" Mr Jaiswal said. Separately, the MEA confirmed that India has decided to keep the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance.

            "text": "President Droupadi Murmu has written to Supreme Court and sought its opinion A month after the Supreme Court's landmark verdict in the Tamil Nadu case, which effectively set a deadline for the President and Governors to clear Bills passed by the legislature, President Droupadi Murmu has written to the top court and asked if timelines could be imposed on Governors. President Murmu has sought the Supreme Court's opinion under Article 143 of the Constitution, which gives the President the power to consult the court on legal issues or matters of public importance. \"Is the Governor bound by the aid and advice tendered by the Council of Ministers while exercising all the options available with him when a Bill is presented before him under Article 200 of the Constitution of India?\" the President asked the Supreme Court. President Murmu asked if a Governor's exercise of constitutional discretion is justiciable -- subject to a trial in court. She cited Article 361 of the Constitution, which says the President or the Governor shall not be answerable to any court for the exercise of the powers and duties of office. \"In the absence of a constitutionally-prescribed timeline and the manner of exercise of powers by the President, can timelines be imposed and the manner of exercise be prescribed through judicial orders for the exercise of discretion by the President under Article 201 of the Constitution of India?\" President Murmu asked the Supreme Court, seeking its opinion on the matter. The judgment also said the President must consult the courts on constitutional matters. \"It is expected that the Union executive should not assume the role of the courts in determining the vires of a bill and should, as a matter of practice, refer such question to the Supreme Court under Article 143. We have no qualms in stating that the hands of the executive are tied when engaging with purely legal issues in a bill and only the constitutional courts have the prerogative to study and provide recommendations as regards the constitutionality of a bill,\" the judgment said. It is now the Supreme Court's prerogative whether it sets up a Constitution bench to look into the issue raised by the President or reiterates its earlier two-judge bench's judgment. This comes at a time when the top court has got a new head in Chief Justice of India BR Gavai, who took the oath yesterday."

The police said they will make adequate security arrangements to ensure and facilitate free movement of people for the Shirui Lily Festival, which is being promoted by the state government. The festival celebrates the rare, endangered state flower Shirui Lily that grows in the hills of Ukhrul district, the home of Tangkhul Naga tribe and other Naga communities.

The Manipur State Transport has announced bus service timings from the state capital Imphal to Ukhrul from May 20 to 24 for those who want to visit the picturesque hill town popular with tourists. The Naga insurgent group National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah) or NSCN (IM), responding to the purported Kuki group's May 11 statement threatening members of the Meitei community who may visit Ukhrul for the Shirui Lily Festival, said it will \"not tolerate if KZVV-EZ make any wild attempt to disturb the streaming tourists targeting any particular community travelling to Ukhrul/Shirui village.\""

Valeria Marquez, 23, was murdered by a man who entered her beauty salon in Guadalajara city of Mexico's Jalisco, on the pretext of delivering a gift before opening fire at her, the state prosecutor's office said. Marquez was mid-livestream from her Blossom the Beauty Lounge salon when the incident occurred, a clip of which was shared by RT on X. In the footage, the TikToker was seen seated at a table, clutching a stuffed toy, and talking to her followers. Seconds before the incident, she was heard saying, \"they're coming,\" before a voice in the background asked, \"Hey, Vale?\" \"Yes,\" Marquez replied, just before muting the sound on the live stream. Moments later, shots are heard in the background as Marquez clutched her ribcage before collapsing on the table. A person appeared to pick up her phone, with their face briefly showing on the livestream before the video ended. Per reports, Marquez had said earlier on the livestream that someone came to the salon when she was not there with an \"expensive gift\" to deliver to her. She apparently appeared concerned and said she was not planning to wait for the person to come back. Marquez took a bullet to her chest and head and was pronounced dead at the scene, according to a report by the New York Post. The report said the gunman came on a motorbike and pretended to deliver a gift to her. The influencer had nearly 2,00,000 followers on Instagram and TikTok, and was known for sharing beauty and lifestyle clips online. According to police, Marquez's killing is being investigated according to protocols for femicide, which means the killing of women or girls for reasons of gender. Femicide can involve degrading violence, sexual abuse, a relationship with the murderer, or the victim's body being exposed in a public space, according to the Jalisco state prosecutor."

In an interview with ANI, Mr Rubin said, \"Donald Trump likes to claim credit for everything. If you ask Donald Trump, he single-handedly won the World Cup. He invented the Internet. He cured cancer. Indians should be more like Americans in this regard and not take Donald Trump literally\" Mr Rubin also addressed the role of the United States in the India-Pakistan conflict, emphasising that Washington's diplomatic efforts are crucial to preventing escalation, especially given the potential for nuclear exchange between the two nations. He also said, \"Whenever Pakistan and India come into conflict, the United States tries to mediate behind the scenes, and this is reasonable because the United States is trying diplomatically to provide an off-ramp to prevent unrestricted warfare and also, in a worst case scenario, prevent an escalation to any sort of nuclear exchange. So, the fact that the United States would be in touch with both New Delhi and Islamabad is obvious, and the fact that both New Delhi and Islamabad would use Washington to pass messages is also obvious.\" Trump on Monday had said that his administration played a crucial role in brokering an immediate cessation of hostilities between India and Pakistan, following escalating tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. \"We stopped a nuclear conflict. I think it could have been a bad nuclear war. Millions of people could have been killed. I also want to thank VP JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio for their work. On Saturday, my administration helped broker an immediate cessation of hostilities, I think a permanent one between India and Pakistan the countries having a lot of nuclear weapons,\" Trump had told the media. \"I'm very proud to let you know that the leadership of India and Pakistan was unwavering and powerful... And we helped a lot, and we also helped with trade. I said, 'Come on, we're going to do a lot of trade with you guys. Let's stop it, let's stop it. If you stop it, we're doing trade.

A former Pentagon official, Michael Rubin has said that India targeted terror infrastructure with precision, and it was able to blunt Pakistan's response following the recent strikes. He said that \"Pakistan went running to try to achieve a ceasefire like a scared dog with its tail between its legs\" after India put their airfields out of commission. In an interview with ANI, Mr Rubin who is currently a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute stated that the Pakistani military cannot shield itself from the full reality of the fact that it \"lost very, very badly.\" He said India has emerged victorious both diplomatically and militarily and mentioned that all attention is now on Pakistan's terrorist sponsorship. On how he sees strikes conducted by India on May 7 and whether India was able to achieve what it wanted to convey, Mr Rubin said, \"India won this both diplomatically and militarily. The reason why India won diplomatically is all attention is now on Pakistan's terrorist sponsorship.\" \"The fact that Pakistani officers in uniform attended the funeral of terrorists shows that there is no differentiation between a terrorist and a member of the ISI or the Pakistani armed forces. Basically, the world is going to demand that Pakistan extract the rot from its own system. So, diplomatically, India changed the conversation, militarily, Pakistan is shocked. Look, I'm a historian by training and that means I get paid to predict the past. And one thing that we can say with certainty is that Pakistan has started every single war with India and yet convinced itself that somehow it has won. It's going to be very different...to convince themselves that they won this 4-day war. The reason is. India was able to, with precision, decimate the terror headquarters and training camps.\" \"When Pakistan responded, India was able to blunt their response and then when Pakistan continued to try to retaliate, India was able to put their airfields out of commission. Pakistan went running to try to achieve a ceasefire like a scared dog with its tail between its legs. And the fact of the matter is there is absolutely no spin that the Pakistani military can put on what occurred to shield themselves from the full reality of the fact that they not only lost but they lost very, very badly. The question now, however, is what Pakistan will do next. Clearly, there's a problem within the Pakistani military, both because it's a cancer on Pakistani society and because as a military, it's incompetent and so is Asim Munir going to keep his job? Is the ego of Pakistani generals going to trump the future strength and well-being of all of Pakistani society? Basically, Pakistan needs to clean house, but it's an open question whether they are too far gone to do that,\" he added.

On Monday, Petro said Colombia would join the Belt and Road Initiative launched by Xi in 2013 to recreate the ancient Silk Road and build China\u2019s trade and infrastructure links with the world. Petro, who took over in August 2022, made his first trip to China as president in October 2023, upgrading to a strategic partnership two-way ties first established in 1980."

            "text": "Carney, who won a party race to become prime minister in March before securing victory in Canada's election last month by vowing to stand up to Trump, said Charles's presence in Canada later this month was by design. (Photo: The Canadian Press via AP) Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has criticised Britain\u2019s invitation to Donald Trump for a second state visit, saying it undermined his government\u2019s effort to project a united front against the US president\u2019s talk of annexing Canada. Since taking office in January, Trump has repeatedly said he wants Canada to become the 51st US state \u2014 a suggestion that has angered Canadians and left Britain trying to tread a fine line between the two North American countries. Britain\u2019s King Charles is also head of state of Canada, a former British colony, and the monarch has made a number of symbolic gestures in recent months, wearing Canadian medals, planting a maple tree, and referring to himself as the king of Canada. Charles, who is still undergoing cancer treatment, is also due to attend Canada\u2019s state opening of parliament on May 27 \u2014 the first time a British monarch has attended the event in Ottawa since 1977.

It was at a time when we were being quite clear about the issues around sovereignty,\u201d he said. Carney, who won a party race to become prime minister in March before securing victory in Canada\u2019s election last month by vowing to stand up to Trump, said Charles\u2019s presence in Canada later this month was by design. \u201cAll issues around Canada\u2019s sovereignty have been accentuated by the president. So no, it\u2019s not coincidental, but it is also a reaffirming moment for Canadians,\u201d he said. Starmer, who is trying to improve trading ties with the US after Britain left the European Union, has sought to play to its strengths when dealing with Trump \u2014 talking up its security expertise, pledging higher defence spending, and offering the pomp and pageantry that comes with a state visit. Trump, whose mother was born in Britain and who has repeatedly praised the British royal family, agreed to a limited bilateral trade agreement with London this month. Asked about Carney\u2019s criticism, senior British minister Pat McFadden told Sky News that every country had to decide how to conduct its relations with other countries."

(AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko, File) Former Uruguayan President Jos\u00e9 Mujica, a onetime Marxist guerilla and flower farmer whose radical brand of democracy, plain-spoken philosophy and simple lifestyle fascinated people around the world, has died. He was 89. Uruguay\u2019s left-wing president, Yamand\u00fa Orsi, announced his death, which came four months after Mujica decided to forgo further medical treatment for esophageal cancer and enter hospice care at his three-room ranch house on the outskirts of Montevideo, Uruguay\u2019s capital. \u201cPresident, activist, guide and leader,\u201d Orsi wrote of his longtime political mentor before heading to Mujica\u2019s home to pay his respects. \u201cThank you for everything you gave us.\u201d Mujica had been under treatment for cancer of the esophagus since his diagnosis last spring. Radiation eliminated much of the tumor but soon Mujica\u2019s autoimmune disease complicated his recovery. In January, Mujica\u2019s doctor announced that the cancer in his esophagus had returned and spread to his liver. In recent days, \u201che knew that he was in his final hours,\u201d said Fernando Pereira, the president of Mujica\u2019s left-wing Broad Front party who visited the ailing ex-leader last week. Uruguay\u2019s President Jose Mujica, left, and his wife Lucia Topolansky attend a flag ceremony in Montevideo, Uruguay. (AP Photo/Matilde Campodonico, File) As leader of a violent leftist guerrilla group in the 1960s known as the Tupamaros, Mujica robbed banks, planted bombs and abducted businessmen and politicians on Montevideo\u2019s streets in hopes of provoking a popular uprising that would lead to a Cuban-style socialist Uruguay. A brutal counterinsurgency and ensuing right-wing military dictatorship that ruled Uruguay between 1973 and 1985 sent him to prison for nearly 15 years, 10 of which he spent in solitary confinement. During his 2010-2015 presidency, Mujica, widely known as \u201cPepe,\u201d oversaw the transformation of his small South American nation into one of the world\u2019s healthiest and most socially liberal democracies. He earned admiration at home and cult status abroad for legalizing marijuana and same-sex marriage, enacting the region\u2019s first sweeping abortion rights law and establishing Uruguay as a leader in alternative energy. Rejecting the pomp and circumstance of the presidency, he drove a light blue beat-up 1987 Volkswagen Beetle, wore rumpled cardigan sweaters and sandals with socks and lived in a tin-roof house outside Montevideo, where for decades he tended to chrysanthemums for sale in local markets. \u201cThis is the tragedy of life, on the one hand it\u2019s beautiful, but it ends,\u201d Mujica told The Associated Press in a wide-ranging Oct. 2023 interview from his farmhouse. \u201cTherefore, paradise is here. As is hell.\u201d As the Uruguayan government declared three days of national mourning, tributes poured in from presidents and ordinary people around the world. The first to share remembrances were allied leaders who recalled not only Mujica\u2019s accomplishments but also his hallowed status as one of the last surviving lions of the now-receding Latin American left that peaked two decades ago. Colombian President Gustavo Petro praised Mujica as a \u201cgreat revolutionary.\u201d Bolivia\u2019s former socialist president, Evo Morales said that he \u201cand all of Latin America\u201d are in mourning. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum called Mujica \u201can example for Latin America and the entire world.\u201d Brazil\u2019s Foreign Ministry described him as \u201cone of the most important humanists of our time.\u201d Chile\u2019s leftist President Gabriel Boric paid tribute to Mujica\u2019s efforts to combat social inequality. \u201cIf you left us anything, it was the unquenchable hope that things can be done better,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe unwavering conviction that as long as our hearts beat and there is injustice in the world, it\u2019s worth continuing to fight.\u201d Mujica never attended university and didn\u2019t finish high school. But politics piqued his interest as early as adolescence, when the young flower farmer joined the progressive wing of the conservative National Party, one of the two main parties in Uruguay. His pivot to urban guerrilla warfare came in the 1960s, as leftist struggles swept the region in the wake of the Cuban Revolution. Mujica was shot six times in a firefight with police in a bar. He helped stage a prison break and twice escaped custody. But in 1973 the military seized power, unleashing a reign of terror upon the population that resulted in the forced disappearance of some 200 Uruguayans and the imprisonment of thousands. After power returned to civilians in 1985, Mujica left prison under an amnesty that covered the crimes of the dictators and their guerrilla opponents. He entered mainstream politics with the Broad Front, a coalition of radical leftists and centrist social democrats. Rapidly rising through the party ranks, Mujica charmed the country with his low-key way of living and penchant for speaking his mind. In 2005 he entered government with the Broad Front as an agricultural minister. Just four years later he was Uruguay\u2019s 40th president, elected with 52% of the vote. His wife, Luc\u00eda Topolansky, a former co-revolutionary guerrilla member who was also imprisoned before becoming a prominent politician, bestowed the presidential sash on Mujica at his inauguration \u2014 as is custom for the senator who had received the most votes. They married in 2005 and had no children. \u201cI\u2019ve been with him for over 40 years, and I\u2019ll be with him until the end,\u201d she told a local radio station Sunday as Mujica\u2019s condition deteriorated. Pepe\u2019s bracingly modest and spontaneous style as president \u2014 distributing pamphlets in the streets against machismo culture, lunching in Montevideo bars \u2014 made him a populist folk hero and token of global fascination. Over his years in power, Mujica presided over comfortable economic growth, rising wages and falling poverty. In speeches, he pushed Uruguayans to reject consumerism and embrace their nation\u2019s tradition of simplicity. Under his watch, the small nation became known worldwide for the strength of its institutions and the civility of its politics \u2014 rare features most recently on display during Uruguay\u2019s 2024 presidential vote that vaulted Orsi, Mujica\u2019s moderate prot\u00e9g\u00e9, to power. Mujica\u2019s greatest innovations came on social issues. During his term, Uruguay became the first country in South America to legalize abortion for the first trimester and the first in the world to legalize the production, distribution and sale of marijuana. His government also legalized same-sex marriage, burnishing Uruguay\u2019s progressive image in the predominantly Catholic region. Mujica\u2019s government also powered a green energy revolution that transformed Uruguay into one of the world\u2019s most environmentally friendly nations. Today the country generates 98% of its electricity from biomass, solar and wind energy. Some world leaders disapproved of his disdain for the established order. Conservative Uruguayans voiced outrage over his progressive policies. Still, Mujica ended his tenure with a 60% approval rating. Ineligible to seek re-election because of a ban on consecutive terms, he continued to wield influence at home as an elected senator and abroad as a trailblazer and sage."

Israel has sealed off the Gaza Strip since early March when it resumed its devastating military campaign against militant group Hamas following the collapse of a ceasefire deal, during which aid agencies had delivered thousands of trucks of aid. The IPC analysis found that 1.95 million people, or 93% of the population in the Israeli-blockaded Palestinian enclave, are living through high levels of acute food insecurity, including 244,000 experiencing the most severe, or \u201ccatastrophic\u201d, levels. The IPC analysis projected that 470,000 people, or 22% of the population in Gaza, would fall into the catastrophic category by the end of September, with over a million more at \u201cemergency\u201d levels. \u201cUrgent action is needed to save lives and avert further starvation, further deaths and a descent into famine,\u201d it said. Israeli officials have said they do not believe Gaza faces a hunger crisis, that enough aid has entered to sustain the enclave\u2019s population, and that they want to stop supplies coming under the control of Hamas. The IPC, in a brief accompanying its latest analysis, said a plan announced on May 5 by Israeli authorities for delivering aid was \u201cestimated to be highly insufficient to meet the population\u2019s essential needs\u201d.

(AP Photo) A 14th-century Korean Buddhist statue stolen from a Japanese temple nearly 13 years ago was returned on Monday, following a years-long legal battle between Japan and South Korea over its ownership that had further strained sensitive ties between the two Asian neighbours. Dozens of temple members and local residents standing by the roadside applauded to welcome the statue as a truck carrying a wooden container with it arrived at Kannonji, a temple on Japan\u2019s western island of Tsushima. The statue is expected to be kept at a local museum following a ceremony at the temple later in the day. The gilt bronze statue Bodhisattva \u2014 a female goddess of mercy \u2014 is depicted in a sitting position and measures about 50 centimetres (20 inches) in height. It has been designated a cultural asset of the region and was one of two statues stolen in 2012 from Kannonji by thieves who were looking to sell them in South Korea. The South Korean government had returned the other statue to the Japanese temple soon after the authorities recovered it from the thieves, who were arrested and charged. But the Bodhisattva became trapped in a legal dispute after Buseoksa, a South Korean temple in the western coastal city of Seosan, filed a lawsuit, claiming it as the rightful owner. South Korea\u2019s Supreme Court in 2023 ruled in favour of the Japanese temple, ordering the South Korean temple to return the statue. After all the paperwork was completed in January, the statue remained on a 100-day loan to the South Korean temple for a farewell exhibit.

Russia is marking the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union\u2019s victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two on Friday with a military parade attended by China\u2019s Xi Jinping, three years after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Chinese troops took part in the Moscow parade, and some North Korean soldiers in uniform were spotted watching the parade. Afterwards, Putin greeted North Korean army generals with handshakes, hugging one of them. \u201cPyongyang and Moscow will always be together,\u201d said North Korea\u2019s foreign minister Choe Son Hui, according to KCNA. Pyongyang and Moscow have denied the weapons trade, although the two countries have confirmed the deployment of North Korean troops on the frontlines in Russia\u2019s Kursk region."

Ralf Stegner, a member of the Bundestag\u2019s Parliamentary Control Committee, was among politicians from the SPD and Chancellor Friedrich Merz\u2019s conservatives who took part in the April meeting in Baku. Among those they met on April 13 in the Azerbaijan capital was former Russian Prime Minister Viktor Subkov, head of Gazprom\u2019s supervisory board, and Valery Fadeyev, EU-sanctioned chair of Russia\u2019s human rights council. On both sides, the participants were former members of the Petersburger Dialogue, a forum founded in 2001 by Russian President Vladimir Putin and then-Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. The forum was officially disbanded in 2021 after Russia\u2019s crackdown on several participating civil society organisations. Four German participants \u2013 Stegner, Ronald Pofalla \u2013 who once led former Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s office \u2013 and two former regional ministers \u2013 confirmed in a statement to Reuters that they had been at a \u201cprivate\u201d event in Baku. \u201cTalking even in difficult times of growing tension is a fundamental principle of good foreign policy,\u201d they wrote, adding that the \u201cconfidential\u201d meeting was not secret, and none of them had a public mandate to be there or had been paid for their presence. The meeting, first reported by ARD public television and newspaper Die Zeit, took place at a time when Russia\u2019s ties with the EU are in a deep freeze over its invasion of Ukraine. The timing raised questions over the apparent willingness of some politicians to seek rapprochement even as Moscow wages war on a German ally. In Stegner\u2019s case, critics also raised security concerns: Members of the parliamentary control committee have privileged, confidential access to the work of Germany\u2019s foreign and domestic security services, both of them heavily involved in gathering intelligence relating to Russia and the war. \u201cThis is a quite impossible and irritating development that must immediately be cleared up,\u201d Konstantin von Notz, the Green chair of the committee, told Der Spiegel. Roderich Kiesewetter, a conservative member of the committee, said Stegner should explain himself, while liberal European legislator Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann said Stegner should not be nominated for a new term on the committee. \u201cPeople in such a key role have to be above all suspicion,\u201d she told Funke newspapers. \u201cThat is not the case for him.\u201d"

The issue of BRICS membership has been diplomatically sensitive for Saudi Arabia since it was first invited to join in 2023, and remains so with President Donald Trump due to visit next week and Riyadh negotiating nuclear and technology deals. BRICS, founded as a grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa to counter Western dominance of the world order, has grown in recent years to include emerging economies such as the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Indonesia. But while the BRICS website shows Saudi Arabia \u2013 the world\u2019s largest oil exporter \u2013 as a member, it has yet to join, according to the two sources, both with direct knowledge of Saudi policy. Saudi Arabia\u2019s government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Brazil\u2019s foreign ministry referred Reuters to the Saudi government when asked about the kingdom\u2019s listed status as a member on the website. Brazil is currently presiding over BRICS. Riyadh does not want to risk US anger as negotiations are underway with Washington, one of the sources and a diplomat said.

The kingdom\u2019s ambivalence about BRICS membership lays bare its high-stakes balancing act between China, its biggest oil export customer, and Washington, its indispensable security and technology partner \u2013 a tightrope walk made ever more precarious by the deepening US-Chinese divide. \u201cThe Saudis still see tons of value in engaging with BRICS and its member states. They will keep double-dipping \u2013 or multi-dipping \u2013 with global partnerships as long as they can,\u201d said Robert Mogielnicki, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. \u201cI think the Saudi calculation is that what they may be able to get out of the US outweighs what they could get from BRICS membership, at least over the short term.\u201d In January, Trump demanded that BRICS commit to not creating a new currency or supporting another currency that would replace the US dollar, or face 100% tariffs against BRICS nations. While the kingdom still favors its historic ally the United States, it is also seeking to nurture trade ties with China, the largest importer of Saudi crude.

BRICS has sought to shift away from the dollar into other currencies. But a study by the Atlantic Council\u2019s GeoEconomics Center last year showed the greenback remains the world\u2019s primary reserve currency, and neither the euro nor the BRICS countries have managed to reduce global reliance on the dollar. \u201cWhile BRICS is a useful forum for airing grievances over American behaviour, it is not yet a body coherent enough to provide public goods on key issues like currency cooperation, security, or economic integration,\u201d said Steffen Hertog, associate professor in comparative politics at the London School of Economics. \u201cSaudi feels like they have the leverage and they are enjoying the position,\u201d said Saudi analyst Aziz Alghashian. \u201cThey see it that the United States is still the main actor, but there are others that could also provide utility,\u201d he added."

(AP) Turkey\u2019s intelligence service thwarted a remote attack using pagers last year in Lebanon, days after similar attacks by Israel killed dozens and wounded thousands, including members of Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah group, a Turkish daily and officials said Tuesday. Daily Sabah reported that 1,300 pagers and 710 chargers rigged with explosives were confiscated inside a cargo shipment at Istanbul Airport that was on its way to Beirut from Hong Kong. A Turkish security official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, confirmed the report but would not provide further details. In Beirut, Hezbollah\u2019s chief spokesman Youssef el-Zein told The Associated Press Tuesday that days after the September. 17 pagers attack in Lebanon and Syria, Hezbollah informed Turkish intelligence that a shipment of pagers was in Turkey and about to be sent to Lebanon. El-Zein said Turkish authorities confiscated the pagers and most likely destroyed them. He had no further details. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. Israel triggered the Sept. 17 attack when pagers all over Lebanon started beeping. The devices exploded even if a person carrying one failed to push buttons to read an incoming encrypted message. The next day, Israel activated walkie-talkies, some of which exploded at funerals for some of the people who were killed in the pager attacks. Daily Sabah said that acting on a tip that a shipment of pager devices would be in Istanbul to be delivered to Lebanon two days after the attacks, Turkish intelligence agents launched an operation. The newspaper said that authorities discovered a shipment that arrived in Istanbul from Hong Kong one day before the Lebanon explosions. The cargo had 61 boxes and was scheduled to depart from Istanbul to Beirut on Sept. 27 through Istanbul Airport. The cargo was described as a shipment of food choppers, Daily Sabah said. Inside, authorities found 1,300 Gold Apollo brand pagers and 710 desktop chargers. After the pagers attack, Israel expanded the war against Hezbollah with strikes that killed nearly 500 people on Sept. 23, forcing hundreds of thousands to flee their homes.

(AP Photo) Romanians voted on Sunday in the first round of a presidential election that could propel hard-right eurosceptic George Simion to power in a ballot that will test the rise of Donald Trump-style nationalism in the European Union. Simion, 38, opposes military aid to neighbouring Ukraine, is critical of the EU leadership and says he is aligned with the US president\u2019s Make America Great Again movement. Five months after a first attempt to hold the election was cancelled after the first round because of alleged Russian interference in favour of far-right frontrunner Calin Georgescu, since banned from standing again, his heir apparent Simion leads opinion polls, riding a wave of popular anger. About 1.98 million Romanians, or 11% of registered voters, had cast ballots by 0710 GMT, data showed. Voting will end at 9 p.m. (1800 GMT) with exit polls to follow immediately and preliminary results expected later in the evening. Simion voted alongside Georgescu, who called the election a \u201cfraud\u201d and urged people to take their country back. As dozens of people thronged outside the voting station chanting \u201cCalin for president\u201d, Simion said his vote was \u201cto restore democracy.\u201d Simion is polling at around 30%, a comfortable lead but well short of the 50% he needs to avoid a run-off on May 18.

Simion is not the only MAGA-style politician seeking election in central Europe. Karol Nawrocki, the presidential candidate backed by Poland\u2019s main nationalist opposition party in a presidential election on May 18, met Trump this week. If elected, they would expand a cohort of eurosceptic leaders that already includes the Hungarian and Slovak prime ministers. \u201cRomania and Poland are two important countries for the United States,\u201d Simion told Reuters on Friday. \u201cWe represent partners and we represent allies, both military and politically, to the current (US) administration. This is why it is important for MAGA presidents to be in charge in Bucharest and Warsaw.\u201d Romania\u2019s president has a semi-executive role that includes commanding the armed forces and chairing the security council that decides on military aid.

Poles will vote in the first round of a presidential ballot on May 18. Cultivating good relations with the United States is important for a country that sees Washington\u2019s support as essential for its security. \u201cPresident Trump said \u2018you will win\u2019,\u201d Nawrocki told private broadcaster TV Republika. \u201cI read it as a kind of wish for my success in the upcoming elections, and also awareness of it, and after this whole day I can say that the American administration is aware of what is happening in Poland.\u201d Nawrocki had attended the National Day of Prayer at the White House. The White House posted pictures of the meeting in the Oval Office on X, which showed Trump and Nawrocki shaking hands and giving a thumbs up gesture to the camera. The nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party backing Nawrocki has positioned itself as a vocal supporter of Trump, with its lawmakers chanting his name in the Polish parliament after he won reelection. Current president and PiS ally Andrzej Duda was one of Trump\u2019s preferred international partners during his 2017\u20132021 presidency, and they have described themselves as friends. Many Poles have been unnerved by the way in which Trump has upended US foreign policy, and an Opinia24 poll for private broadcaster RMF FM in March showed 49% of respondents believed his actions were bad for Poland, against 29% viewing them positively. Nawrocki is currently second in opinion polls, and is likely to face frontrunner Rafal Trzaskowski from the ruling Civic Coalition (KO) in a second round runoff on June 1, assuming no candidate wins more than 50% of votes in the first round. Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz, a KO member of the European Parliament, was dismissive of the meeting\u2019s significance. \u201cThe president in Poland will be elected by Poles, not Trump and not Americans,\u201d he told private broadcaster Polsat News."

(AP Photo) Preparations for the conclave to find a new pope accelerated Friday with the installation of the chimney out of the Sistine Chapel that will signal the election of a successor to Pope Francis. Vatican firefighters were seen on the roof of the Sistine Chapel installing the chimney, a key moment in the preparation for the May 7 conclave. After every two rounds of voting in the Sistine Chapel, the ballots of the cardinals are burned in a special furnace to indicate the outcome to the outside world. If no pope is chosen, the ballots are mixed with cartridges containing potassium perchlorate, anthracene (a component of coal tar) and sulfur to produce black smoke. But if there is a winner, the burning ballots are mixed with potassium chlorate, lactose and chloroform resin to produce the white smoke. The white smoke came out of the chimney on the fifth ballot on March 13, 2013, and Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was introduced to the world as Pope Francis a short time later from the loggia of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. The chimney installation took place as cardinals arrived in the Vatican for another day of pre-conclave discussions about the needs of the Catholic Church going forward and the type of pope needed to run it. These consultations include all cardinals, including those over age 80 who are ineligible to vote in the conclave itself."

Russia\u2019s Tass news agency reported Wednesday that the bridge would be 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) long and its construction is expected to take 1 \u00bd years, and North Korea\u2019s Korean Central News Agency said the bridge would expand cross-border travel of people, tourism and circulation of commodities. Relations and exchange programs between the two countries have been flourishing in recent years, with North Korea supplying ammunitions and troops to support Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. One railway bridge and air service already connect North Korea and Russia, and in June 2024, the two countries agreed to construct a bridge for automobiles over the Tumen River, which runs along North Korea\u2019s borders with Russia and China. On Thursday, North Korea and Russia simultaneously held a ground-breaking ceremony for the bridge\u2019s construction in their respective border cities, according to the two countries\u2019 state media agencies.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) An estimated 4,700 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded while fighting alongside Russia against Ukrainian forces, South Korea\u2019s spy agency told lawmakers Wednesday. The assessment came two days after North Korea confirmed for the first time that it had sent combat troops to help Russia recapture parts of the Kursk region, which it lost control of to a surprise Ukrainian incursion last year. In a closed-door parliamentary committee briefing, South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service said North Korea had suffered 4,700 casualties, including 600 deaths, on the Russia-Ukraine battlefronts, according to Lee Seong Kweun, one of the lawmakers who attended the meeting. Lee told reporters the NIS said that 2,000 injured North Korean soldiers were repatriated to North Korea by air or train between January and March. He cited the NIS as saying the dead North Korean soldiers were cremated in Russia before their remains were sent back home. In January, the NIS said about 300 North Korean soldiers had died and another 2,700 had been injured, and the South Korean military increased the estimated casualties to 4,000 last month. On Monday, North Korea announced that leader Kim Jong Un had decided to dispatch troops to \u201cannihilate and wipe out the Ukrainian neo-Nazi occupiers and liberate the Kursk area in cooperation with the Russian armed forces.\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin later issued a statement thanking North Korea and promising not to forget the sacrifices of North Korean soldiers. Both Kim and Putin said the North Korean deployment was made under their countries\u2019 landmark 2024 defense treaty, which requires each side to provide aid if the other is attacked. The U.S., South Korea and their partners say North Korea has been supplying vast amounts of conventional weapons to replenish Russia\u2019s depleted stocks as well. They suspect Russia is providing North Korea with military and economic assistance in return. U.S., South Korean and Ukraine officials have said North Korea dispatched 10,000-12,000 troops to Russia last fall. South Korea\u2019s military said in March that North Korea sent about 3,000 additional troops to Russia earlier this year. During its Wednesday briefing, the NIS said it assessed that Russia has given North Korea air defense missiles, electronic warfare equipment, drones and technology for spy satellite launches, according to Kim Byung-kee, another lawmaker who attended the NIS briefing. Kim quoted the NIS as saying that 15,000 North Korean laborers have also been sent to Russia under bilateral industrial cooperation programs. The lawmaker said the amount of North Korean missiles and artillery sent to Russia was worth billions of dollars but the NIS hasn\u2019t detected signs that Russia has sent North Korea cash remittances for them.

            "title": "Layoffs, closures and gaps in oversight expected after hundreds of DOJ grants are canceled",
            "text": "The Department of Justice logo is shown on a podium during a news conference. (AP) Activating Change, which helps people with disabilities navigate the criminal justice system, was one of hundreds of organizations that received a notice on April 22 that the Department of Justice was canceling grants they had received through the Office of Justice Programs. More than 350 grants initially worth more than $800 million were ended midstream, sparking layoffs and program closures. The disabilities nonprofit had to lay off nearly half its 26 workers after the government canceled $3 million in direct grants, about $1 million of which had already been spent, and ended pass-through grants from other organizations. Amy Solomon, former assistant attorney general who oversaw the Office of Justice Programs and now a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice, said the cuts touched on every aspect of the department\u2019s portfolio. Also read | Google could use AI to extend search monopoly, DOJ says as trial begins \u201cThis is highly unusual,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cYou expect any administration to have their own priorities, and to implement that in future budget years and with future awards. You would not expect \u2026 grants that have already been granted, obligated or awarded to be pulled back.\u201dThe Office of Justice Programs typically awards nearly $4 billion in grants annually. It was unclear how much money it would take back since some rescinded grants were initially awarded as far back as 2021. Grantees were locked out of the financial system a few days before they were due to be reimbursed for already completed work. How the Justice Department planned to reallocate whatever money is returned was also unclear. Some came from dedicated pots of funding, including from the Victims of Crime Act, which collects fines and penalties in federal cases for programs serving crime victims. A department spokesperson did not respond to questions about the cuts. The cancellation notices noted that grant holders had 30 days to appeal. As of Friday, the department had reversed course on a handful of grants, restoring some funding. Law enforcement priorities The cancellation letters obtained by The Associated Press explained the cuts by saying the department had changed its priorities to focus on \u201cmore directly supporting certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.\u201d But advocates, researchers and leaders in criminal justice said many grants served those purposes. Some cuts seemed to target programs that were started by or were a priority under the Biden administration, such as grants for violence intervention programs. But others appeared to target priorities under Trump\u2019s first administration, including elder abuse and financial exploitation. While cities and law enforcement agencies largely escaped direct cuts, many are feeling the impacts of cancellations to partner programs. In a scathing briefing Wednesday, New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin noted nearly $13 million in ongoing program funding to the state was canceled.\u201cTo say, \u2018We\u2019re going to cut programs that protect people from bias, that help people with opioid addiction, that keep guns off our streets\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s irresponsible, it\u2019s reckless, it\u2019s dangerous, and it\u2019s going to get people killed,\u201d Platkin said. In Baltimore, anti-violence organization Roca is looking for other funding sources after losing about $1 million in grant dollars. The program targets at-risk young men, including gunshot survivors, who receive mentoring, job training and life coaching. It has almost certainly contributed to Baltimore\u2019s recent reductions in homicides, city officials and participants have said. \u201cI\u2019m living proof that it works,\u201d said Sheldon Smith-Gray, a graduate and current employee of the program, which he credits with turning his life around, even after his cousin was killed last year. Cuts were made to research organizations that create standards for training or data collection and provide resources for smaller law enforcement agencies. Three grants to the Police Executive Research Forum were eliminated, including a study of police plans and responses to protests to develop practices for preventing civil disturbances. And the National Policing Institute lost grants that provided technical assistance to rural police departments and support for improving relationships between police and communities of color. Mandated functions A handful of the canceled grants paid for services intertwined with government functions mandated by law, including required audits under the Prison Rape Elimination Act. Impact Justice, which lost millions, had created and managed the PREA Resource Center for more than a decade. \u201cIt\u2019s a collaborative relationship, but we are the ones that execute the work and have the systems and maintain the systems,\u201d said Michela Bowman, vice president of Impact Justice and senior adviser to the PREA Resource Center. She explained that the center designed and owns the audit software and data collection systems.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you what the DOJ plans to do in the alternate,\u201d said Alex Busansky, president and founder of Impact Justice. Safety and victim services Nonprofits that provide services to crime victims also lost grants. Advocates say many cuts will impact public safety, like the elimination of funding for the national crime victims hotline or the loss of a grant to the International Association of Forensic Nurses to provide technical assistance and training to SANE\u2014 Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners\u2014 in underserved areas.\u201cIt\u2019s very important for a survivor to be able to access a rape exam done by a SANE nurse. It\u2019s vital,\u201d said Ilse Knecht, director of policy and advocacy at The Joyful Heart Foundation, and who oversees the agency\u2019s efforts to track and combat a national backlog in untested forensic rape kits. Grants that directly address the backlog seemed to be safe for now, but she said services offered to survivors are essential.\u201cWhen we don\u2019t keep this system that has been set up to keep victims safe and make them want to participate in the criminal justice system \u2026 we are really doing a disservice,\u201d she added. \u201cHow is this helping public safety?\u201dFor Activating Change, the cuts meant an immediate reduction in services. Its leaders rejected the idea their services don\u2019t align with federal priorities.\u201cIt is a catastrophic blow to our organization,\u201d said Nancy Smith, the organization\u2019s executive director. \u201cBut also to the safety net for people with disabilities and deaf people who\u2019ve experienced violent crime in our country.\u201d CM Mamata Banerjee announces financial assistance to jobless Group C and D employees"

In December, the U.N.\u2019s top court was tasked to form an advisory opinion on Israel\u2019s obligations to facilitate aid to Palestinians that is delivered by states and international groups, including the United Nations. Israel has said it would not allow the entry of goods and supplies into Gaza until Palestinian militant group Hamas releases all remaining hostages. Germany, France and Britain last week called on Israel to adhere to international law by allowing the unhindered passage of humanitarian aid into Gaza, after Israel reiterated that no aid would be allowed to enter Gaza, in order to pressure Hamas. Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of hijacking humanitarian aid that was allowed into Gaza. Hamas has denied the allegations and has blamed Israel for shortages. The resolution adopted in December by 137 of the 193 nations in the U.N.\u2019s General Assembly called on Israel to comply with its obligations towards the Palestinian population, as it expressed \u201cgrave concern\u201d about the dire humanitarian situation.

Lee, a liberal who wants greater economic parity in South Korea and warmer ties with North Korea, has solidified his position as front-runner to succeed recently ousted conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol. Lee had led the opposition-controlled parliament\u2019s impeachment of Yoon over his imposition of martial law before the Constitutional Court formally dismissed him in early April. Yoon\u2019s ouster prompted a snap election set for June 3 to find a new president, who will be given a full, single five-year term. Lee, 60, lost the 2022 election to Yoon in the narrowest margin recorded in the country\u2019s presidential elections. In a Gallup Korea poll released Friday, 38 per cent of respondents chose Lee as their preferred new president, while all other aspirants obtained single-digit support ratings.

About 9,000 American and 5,000 Filipino military personnel took part in the combat maneuvers. At least 260 Australian personnel also joined, with smaller observer delegations from Japan and other countries. China has fiercely opposed the combat drills as provocative.

Gen. Michael Cederholm told a small group of journalists, including from The Associated Press, who were invited to witness the transport of the missile system aboard a C-130 Air Force aircraft to Batanes. \u201cWe\u2019re not here practicing a war plan,\u201d said Cederholm. \u201cWe\u2019re practicing for the defense of the Philippines.\u201d The US and the Philippines have denied the annual combat maneuvers \u2014 which both said would focus on a \u201cfull-scale battle scenario\u201d this year \u2014 were aimed at China or any adversary. The lines between what\u2019s mock and real, however, have been at times murky. Asked if US forces would pull out the anti-ship missile system from Batanes after the combat drills, Cederholm did not reply clearly. Additionally, China had repeatedly expressed its strong opposition to the US Army deployment last year of a mid-range missile system in the Philippines for joint exercises. The US Army launcher with at least 16 Standard Missile-6 and the Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles was repositioned in January from an international airport in northern Laoag city to a northwestern coastal area facing the Scarborough Shoal, where China\u2019s forces have used water cannons and dangerous blocking maneuvers against Philippine coast guard and fishery ships and fired flares near Manila\u2019s patrol planes, a Philippine official then told The AP. Tomahawk missiles can travel over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), which places China within their target range. During the combat exercises from April 21 to May 9, American and Filipino forces will also practice jointly defending Philippine islands by repelling hostile forces attempting to assault from the sea in the western Philippine province of Palawan, which faces the South China Sea, and in northern Cagayan province near Batanes. Philippine Brig. Gen. Michael Logico said the combat exercises were crucial to strengthening deterrence against aggression in the Bashi Channel. Early this month, the Chinese military staged largescale drills in the waters around Taiwan and renewed a warning to the self-ruled democracy not to seek independence. Chinese navy, air, ground and rocket forces staged the drills. The Philippines used to host two of the largest US Navy and Air Force bases outside the American mainland.

(Photo: Pooja Bhula/ Representational) Campgrounds, boat ramps and other facilities in at least 30 locations at federal lakes and reservoirs in six states will be closed or have their hours curtailed as of mid-May as the Trump administration tries to rapidly shrink the US government. Officials at the US Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees the lakes and reservoirs and their amenities for boating, camping, hiking and sightseeing, said they are dealing with staffing shortages and other budgetary restrictions. Corps spokesman Douglas Garman said concentrating staff at fewer recreational sites will allow those sites to keep the \u201cfull range of services\u201d that visitors expect. The Corps\u2019 district office in Omaha, Nebraska, which oversees facilities across a large swath of the Great Plains from western Iowa and Nebraska to Montana\u2019s border with Canada, said the changes also will protect hydropower and dam operations. \u201cDecisions to make operational changes at recreation areas are not made lightly, and we understand those decisions can be disruptive to the public\u2019s travel plans,\u201d Garman said in an email to The Associated Press. President Donald Trump imposed a federal hiring freeze after beginning his second term in January, and his Department of Government Efficiency is trying to eliminate tens of thousands of government jobs. In Pickstown, South Dakota, residents were \u201cappalled\u201d to learn the Corps plans to close its visitor center at the Fort Randall Dam and suspend tours of the dam\u2019s powerhouse on May 1, said Cindy Broyhill, the president of the town\u2019s Board of Trustees.

The sites and water nearby still will be accessible during the day. Emily Coffin, the district\u2019s natural resource section chief, said the district has pursued efficiency initiatives for five or six years that will lead to fewer visitor-staff interactions. They include self-service campsite registrations, cashless parking and payments through codes scanned with smartphones. \u201cIt just may be a little bit more noticeable because we have more of that built on than maybe we did two years ago,\u201d she said.

The Omaha district announced earlier this month that it would close six campgrounds in the Dakotas on May 1, as well as three visitor centers in South Dakota and Montana. It also plans to suspend or limit tours of four South Dakota dam powerhouses and decrease tours at Fort Peck Dam in northeast Montana.

(File Photo) A New York man told federal agents, \u201cI know I\u2019m finished,\u201d when he was arrested Thursday on charges that he concealed his leadership role in the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 in his applications for a green card and US citizenship, prosecutors said. Faustin Nsabumukunzi, 65, was charged with hiding from US authorities his role as a local leader in Rwanda when the genocide began in 1994. An estimated 800,000 Tutsis were killed during the three-month-long genocide. The indictment of the Bridgehampton man was unsealed in Central Islip on Long Island. At an initial court appearance, Nsabumukunzi pleaded not guilty to visa fraud and attempted naturalization fraud and was released on $250,000 bail. The bail package requires home detention and GPS monitoring, but he will be allowed to continue working as a gardener. Evan Sugar, a lawyer for Nsabumukunzi, described his client in an email as \u201ca law-abiding beekeeper and gardener who has lived on Long Island for more than two decades.\u201d He said Nsabumukunzi was \u201ca victim of the Rwandan genocide who lost scores of family members and friends to the violence.\u201d Sugar said Nsabumukunzi was rightfully granted refugee status and lawful permanent residence and planned to \u201cfight these 30-year-old allegations\u201d while maintaining his innocence. In a detention memo seeking detention, prosecutors said interviews of witnesses who knew him in Rwanda indicated that Nsabumukunzi falsely assured Tutsis at public meetings when the genocide began that they would be protected. But, they said, he then, in private meetings, urged Hutus to begin killing Tutsis, the memo says. Prosecutors said witnesses told them that Nsabumukunzi not only participated in the killing of Tutsis, including in his administrative offices, but he also encouraged Hutu men to rape Tutsi women as a genocidal tool. Prosecutors said that when the charges were described to Nsabumukunzi as he was arrested Thursday morning, he responded: \u201cI know I\u2019m finished.\u201d According to the indictment, Nsabumukunzi was sentenced to life in prison after he was convicted on genocide charges in absentia by a Rwandan court. He\u2019d been accused of using his leadership position to oversee the killings of Tutsis in his local area. He allegedly set up roadblocks during the genocide to detain and kill Tutsis and participated in killings, the indictment says. In 2003, Nsabumukunzi applied to settle in the US as a refugee and received a green card in 2007 before applying for citizenship in 2009 and 2015, authorities said. In his applications, they added, he falsely asserted that he was not involved in the genocide. Matthew R. Galeotti, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, said in a release that Nsabumukunzi participated in \u201cheinous acts of violence abroad and then lied his way into a green card and tried to obtain US citizenship.\u201d \u201cFor over two decades, he got away with those lies and lived in the United States with an undeserved clean slate, a luxury that his victims will never have,\u201d said US Attorney John J. Durham in Brooklyn."

Collor, who led the country from 1990 to 1992, was sentenced to eight years and 10 months, to be served initially in prison, rather than under house arrest. Under the Brazilian legal system, cases concerning members of Congress, presidents and ministers go directly to the Supreme Court. He was not yet in prison because his lawyers were still lodging appeals. The case stemmed from the Operation Car Wash, a sweeping corruption probe that has implicated top politicians and businesspeople across Latin America \u2014 including current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who was arrested in 2018 and imprisoned for nearly two years. Collor, 75, was the first Brazilian president elected by popular vote, in 1989, after a 21-year military dictatorship. He was impeached and removed from office by Congress in 1992 following corruption allegations. In 2007, he was elected as a senator representing his home state of Alagoas in northeastern Brazil. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered the former president\u2019s arrest Thursday, with the full board set to vote on Friday whether to confirm the decision. De Moraes said in his decision that Collor should begin serving his sentence, noting that the former president\u2019s lawyers have attempted to drag out proceedings through appeals."

            "text": "Trump signs EO boosting deep-sea mining industry in latest attempt to combat rival China. (Source: AP) US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order aimed at boosting the deep-sea mining industry, marking his latest attempt to boost US access to nickel, copper and other critical minerals used widely across the economy. The order, which Trump signed in private, seeks to jumpstart the mining of both US and international waters as part of a push to offset China\u2019s sweeping control of the critical minerals industry. More than 1 billion metric tons of those nodules are estimated to be in US waters and filled with manganese, nickel, copper and other critical minerals, according to an administration official. Extracting them could boost US GDP by $300 billion over 10 years and create 100,000 jobs, the official added. \u201cThe United States has a core national security and economic interest in maintaining leadership in deep-sea science and technology and seabed mineral resources,\u201d Trump said in the order. Also Read: | India may be first to sign trade deal, says US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent The order directs the administration to expedite mining permits under the Deep Seabed Hard Minerals Resource Act of 1980 and to establish a process for issuing permits along the US Outer Continental Shelf. It also orders the expedited review of seabed mining permits \u201cin areas beyond the national jurisdiction,\u201d a move likely to spark friction with the international community. The International Seabed Authority \u2013 created by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which the US has not ratified \u2013 has for years been considering standards for deep-sea mining in international waters, although it has yet to formalize them due to unresolved differences over acceptable levels of dust, noise and other factors from the practice. \u201cThe United States government has no right to unilaterally allow an industry to destroy the common heritage of humankind, and rip up the deep sea for the profit of a few corporations,\u201d said Arlo Hemphill of Greenpeace, which opposes the practice. Any country can allow deep-sea mining in its own territorial waters, roughly up to 200 nautical miles from shore, and companies are already lining up to mine US waters. Impossible Metals earlier this month asked the administration to launch a commercial auction for access to deposits of nickel, cobalt and other critical minerals off the coast of American Samoa. Shares of The Metals Company \u2013 among the most prominent of deep-sea mining companies \u2013 rose on Thursday by roughly 40% to hit a 52-week high of $3.39 per share after the Reuters report earlier in the day on the executive order. \u201cWith a stable, transparent, and enforceable regulatory pathway available under existing US law, we look forward to delivering the world\u2019s first commercial nodule project, responsibly and economically,\u201d said Gerard Barron, CEO of the company, which aims to extract nodules from a vast plain of the Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and Mexico known as the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. Also Read | What a new study found about the long-term impact of deep sea mining US access to critical minerals \u2013 especially those produced by Chinese companies \u2013 has dwindled in recent months as Beijing has limited exports of several types. That, in turn, has ratcheted up pressure on Washington to support efforts to boost domestic mining. Last week, Trump officials fast-tracked permitting on 10 mining projects across the United States and implemented an abbreviated approval process for mining projects on federal lands. The administration also said it would approve one of the country\u2019s largest copper mines. Trump\u2019s Thursday order uses the term \u201crare earths\u201d to broadly refer to all critical minerals and is not meant to imply the administration believes the nodules contain neodymium and the 16 other rare earths, the administration official said.

(File Photo) Sudan\u2019s notorious paramilitary group attacked a city in the western Darfur region, killing more than 30 people, an activist group said, in the latest deadly offensive on an area that is home to hundreds of thousands of displaced people. The Rapid Support Forces and allied militias launched an offensive on el-Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur province, on Sunday, the Resistance Committees in the city said. Dozens of other people were wounded in the attack, said the group, which tracks the war. There was no immediate comment from the RSF. El-Fasher, more than 800 kilometers (500 miles) southwest of the capital, Khartoum, is under the control of the military, which has fought the RSF since Sudan descended into civil war more than two years ago, killing more than than 24,000 people, according to the United Nations, though activists say the number is likely far higher. The RSF has been attempting to seize el-Fasher for a year to complete its control of the entire Darfur region. Since then, it has launched many attacks on the city and two major famine-hit camps for displaced people on its outskirts. The city is now estimated to be home to more than 1 million people, many of whom have been displaced by the ongoing war and previous bouts of violence in Darfur. The RSF grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militias, mobilized two decades ago by then-president Omar al-Bashir against populations that identify as Central or East African in Darfur. The Janjaweed were accused of mass killings, rapes and other atrocities.The attacks on el-Fasher have intensified in recent months as the RSF suffered battlefield setbacks in Khartoum and other urban areas in the county\u2019s east and center. Sunday\u2019s attack came less than a week after a two-day attack by the RSF and its allied militias on the city and the Zamzam and Abu Shouk camps killed more than 400 people, according to the United Nations. Last week\u2019s attack forced up to 400,000 people to flee the Zamzam camp, Sudan\u2019s largest, which has become inaccessible to aid workers, said U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric."

            "text": "A Pentecostal church in South Africa celebrated Easter Sunday with mass wedding ceremonies for around 3,000 people, with many of them entering into polygamous marriages. The International Pentecost Holiness Church said mass weddings are part of its Easter festivities and the tradition of polygamy, which is observed in some African cultures, has been incorporated into the church. Sunday\u2019s ceremonies would see some men marry their sixth or seventh wives, church spokesperson Vusi Ndala said. Other grooms were set to marry multiple brides at one time, Ndala said. A groomsman shield his brides from the sun as they queue during a mass Easter weddings for 3,000 people, some polygamous, at The International Pentecost Holiness Church in Heidelberg, east of Johannesburg, South Africa. (AP) \u201cPolygamy is not only embraced but held in high regard\u201d in the church, Ndala said. The International Pentecost Holiness Church was founded in South Africa in the early 1960s. It is an African-initiated church, meaning it was founded by Africans rather than foreign missionaries, and blends Pentecostal beliefs with local traditions. The church has held mass weddings before, including in 2023 when around 400 couples or bridal parties tied the knot. It says this year\u2019s event was its largest by far. Ndala said the large number of people being married this year was because of \u201ca large number of men marrying more than one wife at a go.\u201d In some cases, grooms brought their current wife or wives to be with them for their new marriage. People queue during mass Easter weddings for 3,000 people, some polygamous, at the International Pentecost Holiness Church in Heidelberg, east of Johannesburg, South Africa. (AP) The weddings were held at the church\u2019s headquarters, a huge, dome-shaped building in the town of Heidelberg, near Johannesburg, that can seat 60,000 people. The congregants who were being married waited in long white tents set up in open fields next to the church building, where they were given bridal flowers, food packs and water. They then filed into the church building in long queues, the women wearing white bridal gowns and many of the men in matching white suits and red ties. Polygamy is legal in South Africa if the union is registered as a customary marriage."

(AP) President Donald Trump is preparing to make one of the controversial personnel changes laid out in the conservative Project 2025 blueprint for his second term. He plans to reclassify 50,000 federal employees under what\u2019s known as Schedule F, which means they\u2019ll have less civil service protection. The proposal follows an executive order signed at the beginning of his term, and it\u2019s expected to be published in the Federal Register on Friday afternoon. Administration officials argue that it\u2019s necessary to increase accountability in the workforce. The change is expected to make it easier to replace career employees who have \u201cimportant policy-determining, policy-making, policy-advocating, or confidential duties,\u201d according to a White House fact sheet.

Now he\u2019s moving more swiftly to fire people and reshape the government bureaucracy, steps that have alarmed labor unions and political opponents who worry about him consolidating power and violating worker rights. The fact sheet said the plan \u201cempowers federal agencies to swiftly remove employees in policy-influencing roles for poor performance, misconduct, corruption, or subversion of presidential directives, without lengthy procedural hurdles.\u201d Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, criticized the move. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s action to politicize the work of tens of thousands of career federal employees will erode the government\u2019s merit-based hiring system and undermine the professional civil service that Americans rely on,\u201d he said in a statement.

            "text": "A security officer works inside of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) building headquarters Monday. (AP) President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to fire nearly everyone at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was paused on Friday by a federal judge, who said she was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the plan. The decision leaves in limbo a bureau created after the Great Recession to safeguard against fraud, abuse and deceptive practices. Trump administration officials argue that it has overstepped its authority and should have a more limited mission. On Thursday, the administration officials moved to fire roughly 1,500 people, leaving around 200 employees, through a reduction in force that would dramatically downsize the bureau. US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said she was worried the layoffs would violate her earlier order stopping the Republican administration from shutting down the CFPB. She\u2019s been considering a lawsuit filed by an employee union that wants to preserve the bureau.

Other layoffs and policies have been subjected to stop-and-go litigation and court orders. The CFPB has long frustrated businesses with its oversight and investigations, and Trump adviser Elon Musk made it a top target of his Department of Government Efficiency. Mark Paoletta, the CFPB\u2019s chief legal officer, wrote in a court declaration that \u201cthe bureau\u2019s activities have pushed well beyond the limits of the law,\u201d including what he described as \u201cintrusive and wasteful fishing expeditions.\u201d Some of the CFPB\u2019s responsibilities are required by law but would have only one person assigned to them under the Trump administration\u2019s plan. The enforcement division is slated to be cut from 248 to 50 employees. The supervision division faces an even deeper reduction, from 487 to 50, plus a relocation from Washington to the Southeastern region. Before Friday\u2019s hearing, attorneys for the National Treasury Employees Union filed a sworn statement from a CFPB employee identified only by the pseudonym Alex Doe. The employee said Gavin Kliger, a member of DOGE, was managing the agency\u2019s RIF team charged with sending layoff notices. The bureau\u2019s chief operating officer, Adam Martinez, told the judge that he believes Kliger is an Office of Personnel Management employee detailed to the CFPB and doesn\u2019t work directly for DOGE. The pseudonymous employee said team members raised concerns that the bureau had to conduct a \u201cparticularized assessment\u201d before it could implement an RIF. Paoletta told them to ignore those concerns and move forward with mass firings, adding that \u201cleadership would assume the risk,\u201d the employee stated. White House officials did not immediately respond to questions about the judge\u2019s decision or the employee\u2019s court declaration.

(Reuters) About 90% of Russia\u2019s winter crops are in a good or satisfactory condition, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said on Friday, urging the government to provide farmers with everything they need for the spring sowing campaign and fieldwork. The state of winter crops in Russia, the world\u2019s largest wheat exporter, caused concern after reports late last year that at least 37% of winter crops were in a poor condition. Russian grain crops were hit by extreme weather from early spring frosts to drought in 2024, resulting in a 14% fall in grain harvest and lower exports, compared with the previous year. \u201cToday, about 90% of winter grain crops are in good and satisfactory condition, so we expect that the spring fieldwork will be successful,\u201d Mishustin told a government meeting. He also emphasised the need for more farms to have insurance to protect against adverse weather conditions and pledged state support to assist farmers with insurance costs. Last year, only a fifth of all seeded areas were insured, he said. IKAR consultancy sees the 2025 grain harvest at 129.5 million metric tons, above the 126 million tons gathered last year. The wheat harvest is seen by IKAR at 82.5 million tons in a baseline scenario."

(Representational Image/ AP Photo) An airstrike by Somali forces killed 12 al Shabaab militants in central Somalia and another 35 Islamists were killed by the army in a southwestern area as they tried to attack a military base there, the government said on Thursday. The airstrike carried out late on Wednesday came hours after fighters from the al Qaeda-linked group that has been waging an insurgency since 2007 attacked a strategic town in the area. Al Shabaab, which wants to seize power and rule based on its own strict interpretation of Islamic law, briefly captured villages within 50 km (30 miles) of Mogadishu last month, raising fears among residents of the capital that the city could be targeted.

The outcome of the battle was not immediately clear, with government forces and al Shabaab giving conflicting accounts of who was in control of the town. Al Shabaab said its forces had overrun 10 military installations during Wednesday\u2019s fighting. Somali forces have recaptured the villages briefly seized last month, but al Shabaab has continued to advance in the countryside, leading the government to deploy police and prison guards to support the military, soldiers have told Reuters.

            "text": "US President Donald Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's nuclear program if a deal isn't reached Iran confirmed Wednesday that the next round of nuclear talks with the United States this weekend will be held in Rome after earlier confusion over where the negotiations would be held. The announcement by Iranian state television came as Iran\u2019s President Masoud Pezeshkian formally approved the resignation of one of his vice presidents who served as Tehran\u2019s key negotiator in its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. The head of the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog, Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency, also arrived in the Islamic Republic on Wednesday. His talks may include negotiations over just what access the IAEA inspectors can get under any proposed deal. The state TV announcement said Oman will again mediate the talks on Saturday in Rome. Oman\u2019s foreign minister served as an interlocutor between the two sides at talks last weekend in Muscat, the sultanate\u2019s capital. Officials initially on Monday identified Rome as hosting the negotiations, only for Iran to insist early Tuesday they would return to Oman. American officials so far haven\u2019t said publicly where the talks will be held, though Trump did call Oman\u2019s Sultan Haitham bin Tariq on Tuesday, while the ruler was on a trip to the Netherlands. The stakes of the negotiations couldn\u2019t be higher for the two nations closing in on half a century of enmity. US President Donald Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear program if a deal isn\u2019t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. Grossi visit comes as Iran has restricted IAEA access Grossi arrived in Tehran for meetings with Pezeshkian and others. He met Wednesday night with Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, writing on the social platform X after the meeting: \u201cCooperation with (the IAEA) is indispensable to provide credible assurances about the peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme at a time when diplomacy is urgently needed.\u201d Iran\u2019s state-run IRNA news agency described Araghchi as briefing Grossi on the first round of talks with the US, while also urging the IAEA to \u201cadopt a clear and transparent stance regarding threats against Iran\u2019s peaceful nuclear facilities.\u201d Both Israel and the US have threatened to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear sites if a deal can\u2019t be reached to limit Tehran\u2019s programme. \u201cAs variety of spoilers are gathered to derail current negotiations, we need a Director General of Peace,\u201d Araghchi wrote on X. \u201cOur predisposition is to trust Grossi in mission to keep the Agency away from politics and politicization, and to retain focus on its technical mandate.\u201d Since the nuclear deal\u2019s collapse in 2018 with Trump\u2019s unilateral withdraw of the US from the accord, Iran has abandoned all limits on its programme, and enriches uranium to up to 60 per cent purity \u2014 near weapons-grade levels of 90 per cent. Iran\u2019s foreign minister questions contradictory responses from US envoy Meanwhile, Araghchi on Wednesday warned the US about taking contradictory stances in the talks. That likely refers to comments from US Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, who this week initially suggested a deal could see Iran go back to 3.67 per cent uranium enrichment \u2014 like in the 2015 deal reached by the Obama administration. Witkoff then followed up with saying \u201ca deal with Iran will only be completed if it is a Trump deal.\u201d \u201cIran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cIt is imperative for the world that we create a tough, fair deal that will endure, and that is what President Trump has asked me to do.\u201d Araghchi warned America about taking any \u201ccontradictory and opposing stances\u201d in the talks.

            "text": "Trump's choice to get directly involved in negotiations points to his desire to quickly finalize a slew of trade deals as China is pursuing its own set of agreements. (Source: File) President Donald Trump on Wednesday inserted himself directly into trade talks with Japanese officials, a sign of the high stakes for the United States after its tariffs rattled the economy and caused the administration to assure the public that it would quickly reach deals. The Republican president attended the meeting alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, top economic advisers with a central role in his trade and tariff policies. \u201cHopefully something can be worked out which is good (GREAT!) for Japan and the USA!\u201d Trump wrote in a social media post ahead of the meeting. Afterward, he posted: \u201cA Great Honor to have just met with the Japanese Delegation on Trade. Big Progress!\u201d Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told reporters Thursday in Tokyo that his chief trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, told him from Washington that the talks were \u201cvery candid and constructive.\u201d \u201cOf course the talks are not easy, but President Trump stated his intention to make this negotiation a top priority,\u201d Ishiba said. \u201cI believe we had talks that lead to a next step.\u201d Ishiba said he will closely watch how ministerial talks go and plans to visit Washington to meet with Trump at an appropriate time. Trump\u2019s choice to get directly involved in negotiations points to his desire to quickly finalize a slew of trade deals as China is pursuing its own set of agreements. It\u2019s an open test of Trump\u2019s reputation as a dealmaker as countries around the world seek to limit the potential damage unleashed by his import taxes. The sweeping tariffs that Trump announced on April 2 triggered panic in the financial markets and generated recession fears, causing the U.S. president to quickly put a partial 90-day hold on the import taxes and increase his already steep tariffs against China to as much as 145%. The pause temporarily spared Japan from 24% across-the-board tariffs, but there continues to be a 10% baseline tariff and a 25% tax on imported cars, auto parts, steel and aluminum exports. With Japan charging an average tax rate of 1.9% on other countries\u2019 goods and having a longstanding alliance with the U.S., the talks on Wednesday are a crucial indicator of whether the Trump administration can achieve a meaningful deal that reassures the markets, American voters and foreign allies. U.S. economic rival China, meanwhile, is trying to capitalize on the turmoil around Trump\u2019s announcements, with its leader, President Xi Jinping, touring nations of Southeast Asia and promoting his country as a more reliable trade partner. Japan is among the first countries to start open negotiations with the U.S. Trump and other administration officials have said the phones have been \u201cringing off the hook\u201d with dozens of countries calling, eager to strike deals with a president who views himself as a master negotiator to avoid tariffs when the 90-day pause ends. Israel and Vietnam have offered to zero out their tariff rates, but Trump has been noncommittal as to whether that would be sufficient. On Thursday, Trump is scheduled to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who will likely be carrying messages on behalf of the European Union about how to resolve the tariffs Trump placed on the 27-state group. Still, the U.S. president may also be feeling increased domestic pressures to settle any tariffs as many voters say they returned Trump to the White House with the specific goal of improving the economy. California Gov. Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit Wednesday that argues that Trump overstepped his authority by declaring an economic emergency to levy his tariffs, with the Democrat saying in a statement that the tariffs have caused economic chaos. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that Trump\u2019s tariff policies would hurt the U.S. economy, a direct warning to a White House trying to sell the import taxes as a long-term positive for the country. \u201cThe level of tariff increases announced so far is significantly larger than anticipated, and the same is likely to be true of the economic effects which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\u201d Powell said at the Economic Club of Chicago. Japan, like many other nations trying to minimize the possible economic fallout from Trump\u2019s tariffs, has been scrambling to respond. It has set up a special task force to assess the impact of the tariffs and offer loans to anxious companies. Although Ishiba has been working hard to coax exemptions out of Trump, the government has said little officially on what concessions it might offer during these talks. Nor has the administration been transparent about its asks. The Trump administration is seeking to close the $68.5 billion trade deficit with Japan and seeking greater access for U.S. goods in foreign markets, yet the president has also insisted that tariff revenues can be used to pay down the federal budget deficit. \u201cJapan is coming in today to negotiate Tariffs, the cost of military support, and \u2018TRADE FAIRNESS,\u2019\u201d Trump posted Wednesday. Japan has contended that Trump\u2019s tariff measures are likely to violate bilateral trade agreements or World Trade Organization rules. While Ishiba has said he opposes retaliatory tariffs, he also has said he is in no rush to push for a settlement because he doesn\u2019t want concessions. Xi is touring Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this week on a trip that likely was planned before the tariffs\u2019 uncertainty but that he\u2019s also using to promote Beijing as a source of stability in the region and shore up relationships in that part of the world as he looks for ways to mitigate the 145% tariffs that Trump is keeping on China. In Washington, Trump has indicated that he also wants to discuss how much the Japanese contribute to the cost of U.S. troops stationed there, largely as a deterrent to China. Trump\u2019s demand for more defense spending concerns the Japanese government. Under its national security strategy, Japan aims to double annual defense spending to nearly $10 trillion, or 2% of GDP, in 2027, while there is a concern that Trump may ask for that to be increased to 3% of GDP. Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said Tuesday that the military budget for this year is about 1.8% of Japan\u2019s GDP."

(South Korea Air Force via AP) North Korea on Thursday threatened unspecified retaliation after the US flew long-range bombers over South Korea during training with South Korean warplanes, which North Korea views as practice for an attack against it. The US flew the B-1B bombers Tuesday to train with other US and South Korean fighter jets. South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry had said the drill was meant to show the two countries\u2019 combined deterrence capability against North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear program. The U.S. and South Korea routinely hold joint military exercises that they describe as defensive in nature. But North Korea regards them as an invasion rehearsal and is particularly sensitive to the U.S. mobilization of strategic assets such as long-range bombers, aircraft carriers and nuclear-powered submarines. \u201cThe recent military move of the U.S. and the ROK is an open threat to the security of our state and a grave provocation that raises the military tension in the region to an extreme dangerous level,\u201d an unidentified spokesperson for North Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry said in a statement carried in state media.

            "title": "White House starting new media policy to restrict wire services\u2019 access to president",
            "text": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks with reporters in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Fresh from a courtroom loss over The Associated Press\u2019 access to the presidency, the White House on Tuesday put forward a new media policy that sharply curtails access to Donald Trump by news agencies that serve media outlets around the world. It was the latest attempt by the new administration to control coverage of its activities. The move would block the AP and other wire services that serve billions of readers through thousands of news outlets. It comes after a judge ruled the White House had violated the organization\u2019s free speech by banning it because it disagreed with the outlet\u2019s decision not to rename the Gulf of Mexico. While outlining a new \u201cpool coverage\u201d policy for small spaces like the Oval Office and Air Force One, the White House also said it will ultimately give press secretary Karoline Leavitt the final say over who gets to question her boss, according to people who have seen the plan. The White House did not return messages for comment on Tuesday evening. A federal judge last week ruled the White House improperly punished the AP for refusing to rename the Gulf of Mexico by blocking its reporters and photographers from covering the events. U.S. District Judge Trevor N. McFadden ordered the administration to treat the AP as it does other news organizations. A day after defying McFadden\u2019s ruling and continuing AP\u2019s ban when Trump and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele met with reporters in the Oval Office, the White House leaked a new policy to selected journalists. For many years, the White House Correspondents Association has run the pool for the limited space events, and each time it has included reporters from the wire services AP, Reuters and Bloomberg. One print reporter was also allowed, selected on a rotating basis from more than 30 news outlets. The White House now says it will lump the three wire services with print reporters for two slots \u2014 meaning roughly three dozen reporters will rotate for two regular slots. Wire services typically report and write stories that are used in multiple locations around the country and the planet. Even with the rotation, the White House said Trump\u2019s press secretary \u201cshall retain day-to-day discretion to determine composition of the pool.\u201d The new policy says reporters will also be allowed in \u201cirrespective of the substantive viewpoint expressed by an outlet.\u201d In a statement, the AP\u2019s Lauren Easton said the outlet was deeply disappointed that rather than restore the AP\u2019s access, the White House instead chose restrictions over all of the wire services. \u201cThe administration\u2019s actions continue to disregard the fundamental American freedom to speak without government control or retaliation,\u201d Easton said Tuesday night. The independent White House Correspondents\u2019 Association said the administration\u2019s insistence on retaining control over who covers the president shows that it is unwilling to guarantee that it would not continue \u201cviewpoint discrimination.\u201d \u201cThe government should not be able to control the independent media that covers it,\u201d said Eugene Daniels, the association\u2019s president. Under Leavitt, the White House has given greater access to news outlets friendly to Trump. That was visible Tuesday, when the first reporter Leavitt addressed during a briefing asked two questions while also praising Trump policy. At Monday\u2019s Oval Office meeting, Trump bristled at questions from CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins about a man deported to an El Salvador prison, at one point accusing CNN of \u201chating our country.\u201d He made it a point to contrast her questions with a non-pointed one from another reporter. Also Read | US judge lifts Trump White House restrictions on AP, ruling govt can\u2019t bar its journalists Despite the occasional fireworks, Trump has made himself accessible to the media more than his predecessor, former President Joe Biden. Cramped-quarters events, particularly in the Oval Office, are some of his favorite places to talk \u2014 rendering the new access policy all the more impactful. The new policy advanced on Tuesday did not address access for photographers. At an earlier court hearing about the AP\u2019s case, the outlet\u2019s chief White House photographer, Evan Vucci, and correspondent Zeke Miller testified about how the ban has hurt the business of a news agency built to quickly get news and images to its customers. The White House has argued that press access to the president is a privilege, not a right, that it should control \u2014 much like it decides to whom Trump gives one-on-one interviews. In court papers filed last weekend, his lawyers signaled that even with McFadden\u2019s decision, the AP\u2019s days of unchallenged access to open presidential events were over. \u201cNo other news organization in the United States receives the level of guaranteed access previously bestowed upon the AP,\u201d the administration argued. \u201cThe AP may have grown accustomed to its favored status, but the Constitution does not require that such status endure in perpetuity.\u201d The administration has not curtailed AP access to Leavitt\u2019s briefings over the past two months. It has blocked access to events in the East Room to White House-credentialed AP reporters \u2014 until Tuesday, when one was allowed into an event that involved the Navy football team.

            "text": "At least 600 students at more than 90 colleges and universities have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated in recent weeks. (AP) At first, the bar association for immigration attorneys began receiving inquiries from a couple students a day. These were foreigners studying in the US, and they\u2019d discovered in early April their legal status had been terminated with little notice. To their knowledge, none of the students had committed a deportable offense. In recent days, the calls have begun flooding in. Hundreds of students have been calling to say they have lost legal status, seeking advice on what to do next. \u201cWe thought it was going to be something that was unusual,\u201d said Matthew Maiona, a Boston-based immigration attorney who is getting about six calls a day from panicked international students. \u201cBut it seems now like it\u2019s coming pretty fast and furious.\u201d The speed and scope of the federal government\u2019s efforts to terminate the legal status of international students have stunned colleges across the country. Few corners of higher education have been untouched, as schools ranging from prestigious private universities, large public research institutions and tiny liberal arts colleges discover status terminations one after another among their students. At least 600 students at more than 90 colleges and universities have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated in recent weeks, according to an Associated Press review of university statements and correspondence with school officials. Advocacy groups collecting reports from colleges say hundreds more students could be caught up in the crackdown. Students apparently targeted over minor infractions Around 1.1 million international students were in the United States last year \u2014 a source of essential revenue for tuition-driven colleges. International students are not eligible for federal financial aid, and their ability to pay tuition often factors into whether they will be admitted to American schools. Often, they pay full price. Many of the students losing their legal status are from India and China, which together account for more than half the international students at American colleges. But the terminations have not been limited to those from any one part of the world, lawyers said. Four students from two Michigan universities are suing Trump administration officials after their F-1 student status was terminated last week. Their attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, Ramis Wadood, said the students never received a clear reason why. \u201cWe don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s the scary part,\u201d he said. The students were informed of the terminations by their universities via email, which came as a shock, Wadood said. The reason given was that there was a \u201ccriminal records check and/or that their visa was revoked,\u201d Wadood said, but none of them were charged or convicted of crimes. Some had either speeding or parking tickets, but one didn\u2019t have any, he said. Only one of the students had known their entry visa was revoked, Wadood said. Students have filed similar lawsuits in several other states, arguing they were denied due process. In New Hampshire, a federal judge last week granted a temporary restraining order to restore the status of a Ph.D. student at Dartmouth College, Xiaotian Liu, while he challenges the revocation of his visa. In a break from past, feds cancel students\u2019 status directly At many colleges, officials learned the legal immigration status of some international students had been terminated when staff checked a database managed by the Department of Homeland Security. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school. The system to track enrollment and movements of international students came under the control of Immigration and Customs Enforcement after 9/11, said Fanta Aw, CEO of NAFSA, an association of international educators. She said recent developments have left students fearful of how quickly they can be on the wrong side of enforcement. \u201cYou don\u2019t need more than a small number to create fear,\u201d Aw said. \u201cThere\u2019s no clarity of what are the reasons and how far the reach of this is.\u201d Her group says as many as 1,300 students have lost visas or had their status terminated, based on reports from colleges. Foreigners who are subject to removal proceedings are usually sent a notice to appear in immigration court on a certain date, but lawyers say affected students have not received any notices, leaving them unsure of next steps to take. Some schools have told students to leave the country to avoid the risk of being detained or deported. But some students have appealed the terminations and stayed in the United States while those are processed. Still others caught in legal limbo aren\u2019t students at all. They had remained in the U.S. post-graduation on \u201coptional practical training,\u201d a one-year period \u2014 or up to three for science and technology graduates \u2014 that allows employment in the U.S. after completing an academic degree. During that time, a graduate works in their field and waits to receive their H-1B or other employment visas if they wish to keep working in the U.S. Around 242,000 foreigners in the U.S. are employed through this \u201coptional practical training.\u201d About 500,000 are pursuing graduate degrees, and another 342,000 are undergraduate students. Among the students who have filed lawsuits is a Georgia Tech Ph.D. student who is supposed to graduate on May 5, with a job offer to join the faculty. His attorney Charles Kuck said the student was likely targeted for termination because of an unpaid traffic fine from when the student lent his car to a friend. Ultimately, the violation was dismissed. \u201cWe have case after case after case exactly like that, where there is no underlying crime,\u201d said Kuck, who is representing 17 students in the federal lawsuit. He said his law firm has heard from hundreds of students. \u201cThese are kids who now, under the Trump administration, realize their position is fragile,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve preyed on a very vulnerable population. These kids aren\u2019t hiding. They\u2019re in school.\u201d Some international students have been adapting their daily routines. A Ph.D. student from China at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill said she has begun carrying around her passport and immigration paperwork at the advice of the university\u2019s international student office. The student, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities, said she has been distressed to see the terminations even for students like her without criminal records. \u201cThat is the most scary part because you don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re going to be the next person,\u201d she said.

Abdel-Fattah Burhan, is greeted by troops as he arrives at the Republican Palace, recently recaptured from the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group, in Khartoum, Sudan. (AP Photo, File) More than 300 civilians were killed in two days of intense fighting in Sudan\u2019s conflict-wracked Darfur region, the U.N. humanitarian agency reported Monday, as the African country\u2019s brutal civil war nears the two-year mark. The attacks launched by Sudan\u2019s notorious paramilitary group on two famine-hit camps for displaced people in North Darfur and its nearby capital on Friday and Saturday were initially reported to have left more than 100 dead, including 20 children and nine aid workers, according to a U.N. official. But the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, known as OCHA, reported the much higher death toll Monday, citing local sources that were not identified. The Associated Press could not independently verify the numbers due to the conditions and communications on the ground. Sudan plunged into conflict on April 15, 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including the vast western Darfur region. Since then, at least 24,000 people have been tallied as being killed, according to the United Nations, though activists say the number is far higher.

The war has created the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis and worst displacement crisis, and it has led to Sudan becoming the only country in the world experiencing famine. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said OCHA has received reports of mass casualties and large-scale displacement following the recent fighting in and around the Zamzam and Abu Shorouk displacement camps, as well as North Darfur\u2019s capital, El Fasher, the only capital in Darfur that the RSF doesn\u2019t control. North Darfur is one of five states in the Darfur region. \u201cPreliminary figures from local sources indicate that more than 300 civilians have been killed, including 10 humanitarian personnel from the NGO Relief International who lost their lives while operating one of the last functioning health centers in Zamzam camp,\u201d Dujarric said. The escalation in the fighting came ahead of a conference in London to spotlight the war\u2019s anniversary on Tuesday organized by Britain, the European Union, Germany and France, where more than 20 foreign ministers are expected along with representatives of global organizations. Dujarric said the United Nations wants the conference to see Sudan\u2019s \u201cneighbors and the international community move in unity of purpose towards peace instead of fueling the conflict.\u201d Also Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council has scheduled emergency closed consultations on Sudan. Also Read | A year after fighting broke out in Sudan, what is the state of the conflict? The U.N. migration agency said Monday the RSF attacks in Zamzam camp have displaced between 60,000 to 80,000 families in the past two days. The majority of the families remain within El Fasher, which is under military control but has been besieged by the RSF for over a year. Mamadou Dian Balde, the U.N. refugee office\u2019s regional director, said in a video press conference with U.N. correspondents that \u201cmassive violations of human rights\u201d have forced almost 13 million Sudanese to flee their homes, including 4 million who fled to other countries. Most fled to Sudan\u2019s immediate neighbors, but more than 200,000 have gone to Libya and about 70,000 to Uganda, he said. Balde said the U.N. refugee agency\u2019s appeal for $1.8 billion to help the millions of refugees and their host nations is only 10% funded. He warned that if it doesn\u2019t get more money, people will move toward southern Africa, east Africa, the Gulf countries and Europe. \u201cWe really hope that tomorrow\u2019s event in London will also show greater support for the Sudanese brothers and sisters who have been displaced,\u201d Balde said.

            "text": "Prisoners look out from their cell at the Terrorist Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador, during a tour by the Costa Rica Justice and Peace minister. (AP Photo/Salvador Melendez) President Donald Trump on Monday reiterated that he\u2019d like to send U.S. citizens who commit violent crimes to prison in El Salvador, telling that country\u2019s president, Nayib Bukele, that he\u2019d \u201chave to build five more places\u201d to hold the potential new arrivals. Trump\u2019s administration has already deported immigrants to El Salvador\u2019s notorious mega-prison CECOT, known for its harsh conditions. The president has also said his administration is trying to find \u201clegal\u201d ways to ship U.S. citizens there, too. Trump on Monday insisted these would just be \u201cviolent people,\u201d implying they would be those already convicted of crimes in the United States, though he\u2019s also floated it as a punishment for those who attack Tesla dealerships to protest his administration and its patron, billionaire Elon Musk. But it would likely be a violation of the U.S. Constitution for his administration to send any native-born citizen forcibly into an overseas prison. Indeed, it would likely even violate a provision of a law Trump himself signed during his first term.

(AP Photo/Nathan Howard) Here\u2019s a look at the notion of sending U.S. citizens to prison in a foreign country, why it\u2019s likely not legal and some possible legal loopholes. Immigrants can be deported from the United States, while citizens cannot. Deportation is covered by immigration law, which does not apply to U.S. citizens. Part of being a citizen means you cannot be forcibly sent to another country. Immigrants can be removed, and that\u2019s what\u2019s been happening in El Salvador. The country is taking both its own citizens that the United States is sending as well as those from Venezuela and potentially other countries that will not take their own citizens back from the U.S. The Venezuelans sent there last month had no opportunity to respond to evidence against them or appear before a judge. That\u2019s the deal the Trump administration signed with Bukele. The U.S. has sent people to El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama and elsewhere even when they are not citizens of those countries. But, under international agreements, people cannot be sent to countries where they are likely to be persecuted or tortured. Bukele calls himself \u201cthe world\u2019s coolest dictator\u201d and has cracked down on human rights during his administration. He\u2019s also turned El Salvador from one of the world\u2019s most violent countries into a fairly safe one. Trump has embraced that example, including during the Oval Office visit Monday. Sending immigrants from countries like Venezuela to El Salvador sends a message to would-be migrants elsewhere about the risks of trying to make it to \u2014 or stay in \u2014 the United States. There\u2019s a second benefit to the administration: People sent to El Salvador are outside the jurisdiction of United States courts. Judges, the administration argues, can\u2019t order someone sent to El Salvador to be released or shipped back to the U.S. because the U.S. government no longer has control of them. It\u2019s a potential legal loophole that led Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor to issue a grim warning in her opinion in a 9-0 U.S. Supreme Court finding that the administration could not fly alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador with no court hearing, even after Trump invoked an 18th century law last used during World War II to claim wartime powers. \u201cThe implication of the Government\u2019s position is that not only noncitizens but also United States citizens could be taken off the streets, forced onto planes, and confined to foreign prisons with no opportunity for redress,\u201d Sotomayor warned. Also Read | El Salvador president says Maryland man wrongfully deported will not be returned to US in meeting with Trump She was writing to dissent from the majority taking the case from the federal judge who had initially barred the administration from any deportations and had ordered planes en route to El Salvador turned around \u2014 an order the administration apparently ignored. A second case highlights the risks of sending people to El Salvador. The administration admits it sent a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, erroneously to El Salvador. A Salvadoran immigrant, Abrego Garcia, who has not been charged with a crime, had an order against deportation but was shipped to CECOT anyway. On Monday Bukele and Trump scoffed at the idea of sending him back, even though the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the administration to \u201cfacilitate\u201d his return. Nothing like this has ever been contemplated in U.S. history, but it seems unlikely. There are other legal barriers besides the fact that you cannot deport U.S. citizens. The United States does have extradition treaties with several countries where it will send a citizen accused of a crime in that country to face trial there. That appears to be the only existing way a U.S. citizen can be forcibly removed from the country under current law. The Constitution also prohibits \u201ccruel and unusual punishment,\u201d and one of CECOT\u2019s selling points is that conditions there are far harsher than in prisons in the U.S. As noted above, federal courts have no jurisdiction there, and that may deprive people sent there of the constitutional guarantee of due process of law. \u201cIt is illegal to expatriate U.S. citizens for a crime,\u201d wrote Lauren-Brooke Eisen of the Brennan Center for Social Justice in New York. She noted that even if the administration tries to transfer federal prisoners there, arguing they\u2019re already incarcerated, it could run afoul of the First Step Act that Trump himself championed and signed in 2018. The provision requires that the government try to house federal inmates as close to their homes as possible so their families can visit them \u2014 and indeed transfer anyone housed farther than 500 miles from their home to a closer facility. There is one potential loophole that the administration could use to send a small group of citizens to El Salvador. They can try to strip the citizenship of people who earned it after immigrating to the United States. People who were made U.S. citizens after birth can lose that status for a handful of offenses, like funding terrorist organizations or lying on naturalization forms. They would then revert to green card holders, and would be potentially eligible for deportation if convicted of other, serious crimes. That\u2019s a small, but real, pool of people. Perhaps the most significant thing about it is that it would require loss of citizenship first. In other words, there\u2019s still likely no legal way to force a citizen out of the country. But a few could end up in legal jeopardy anyway."

            "text": "A man wearing a mask of President Yoon Suk Yeol celebrates along with others after Yoon was removed from office, near royal palace in downtown Seoul, South Korea. (AP photo) Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s legal saga is far from over. Ten days after he was ousted from office over his martial law declaration, the former conservative South Korean president appeared for the first time at his criminal trial Monday on high-stakes rebellion charges. Yoon\u2019s decision to declare military rule and send troops to Seoul streets in December made him the country\u2019s first president to be indicted while in office. If convicted of rebellion, he could face a life sentence, or theoretically, the death penalty. When the Constitutional Court upheld the parliament\u2019s impeachment of Yoon and removed him from office, it stated Yoon\u2019s violation of the constitution and other laws was too grave to be tolerated and \u201cbetrayed public confidence.\u201d It said Yoon\u2019s martial law enactment \u201ccaused confusion in the society, economy, politics, diplomacy and all other areas.\u201d Given the ruling, there is \u201ca low possibility\u201d for the criminal court to issue a different verdict so Yoon will likely be convicted on rebellion charges, said Park SungBae, a lawyer who specializes in criminal law. The letters read \u2018Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s immediate dismissal.\u2019 (AP photo) The Seoul Central District Court is currently reviewing whether Yoon\u2019s martial law imposition amounted to an act of masterminding a rebellion, a grave charge whose conviction carries only two sentences \u2014 the capital punishment or life imprisonment. Yoon has denied the rebellion charges brought by prosecutors in January. Yoon maintained his decree was a desperate yet peaceful attempt to raise public awareness about how the \u201canti-state\u201d liberal opposition was allegedly abusing its legislative majority to obstruct his agenda and complicate state affairs. \u201cThe fact that they built a rebellion charge over an event that lasted only a few hours and was resolved non-violently after the National Assembly\u2019s demand to lift the measures was immediately accepted \u2026 doesn\u2019t align with proper legal reasoning,\u201d Yoon said Monday at the court, according to Yonhap news agency. Some observers earlier said Yoon\u2019s rebellion charges were debatable as his decree didn\u2019t lead to major violence or cause any serious civilian casualties. The main issue in Yoon\u2019s criminal trial is whether his deployment of hundreds of troops to the National Assembly and election commission offices constituted an illegal attempt to shut down those institutions. While a president has no constitutional authority to shutter the legislature \u2014 even under martial law \u2014 Yoon\u2019s martial law command did declare a suspension of all political activities at the National Assembly. Also Read | South Korea\u2019s ousted leader Yoon due in court as criminal trial starts Yoon has defended his actions, saying he never attempted to paralyze the National Assembly and had always planned to accept the outcome if lawmakers voted to lift martial law \u2014 which they did just hours after its declaration. His claims contradict the testimonies of some military commanders, who say Yoon ordered them to drag lawmakers out of the chamber to prevent them from voting against his decree. The Seoul court will focus on \u201cdetermining whether there was an intent to undermine constitutional order, and individually assess a broad range of specific actions, including the circumstances under which the military and police forces were deployed,\u201d said Yang Hong-seok, a lawyer. Yoon\u2019s dismissal prompted a June 3 snap election to choose his successor, who will be given a full five-year term. Observes say Yoon will likely influence his People Power Party\u2019s selection of its presidential candidate, as he would want someone who can stand up for him and pardon him if he\u2019s convicted. In a public message last week, Yoon expressed gratitude to his supporters and stressed that he will \u201ccontinue to do my utmost\u201d to build the \u201cfree and prosperous Republic of Korea that we have dreamed of together.\u201d Yoon no longer enjoys presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions. Experts say prosecutors could subsequently charge him with abuse of power and other crimes related to his martial law decree. Park said Yoon\u2019s trial at the Seoul district court is expected to last one-two years as there are too many witnesses to question and too many documents to examine. Yang said he expects a verdict within a year, given how crucial the case is. Appeals can send Yoon\u2019s case to a higher court and then the Supreme Court, but their verdicts won\u2019t likely take more than a year altogether, Park said.

Former Colorado sheriff\u2019s deputy Andrew Buen was convicted in the shooting death of Glass, who was in distress and called 911 for help. (Clear Creek County Sheriff's Office via AP, File) A former Colorado sheriff\u2019s deputy convicted of killing a 22-year-old man in distress who called 911 for help was sentenced Monday to three years in prison, the maximum sentence, by a judge who said the shooting was about power. Andrew Buen was convicted in February of criminally negligent homicide in the 2022 death of Christian Glass, which drew national attention and prompted calls to reform how authorities respond to people with mental health problems. Prosecutors alleged that Buen needlessly escalated a standoff with Glass, who showed signs of a mental health crisis and refused orders to get out of his SUV near Silver Plume, a small, former mining town along Interstate 70 in the Rocky Mountains west of Denver. Judge Catherine Cheroutes said Buen\u2019s sentence needed to address both the loss of Glass and the damage done to the community by the shooting. \u201cI think this was about power. It wasn\u2019t a mistake. It was about, \u2018you need to listen to me because I\u2019m in charge,\u2019\u201d she said. She said she believed Buen\u2019s family and supporters that he was a \u201cshirt-off-your-back kind of guy\u201d but said he acted differently when he put on a uniform and had a gun. Glass\u2019s family had questioned whether any remorse Buen might show would be sincere. Buen, his voice shaking, said they had every right to feel the way they do. He said his actions had escalated the standoff and told the judge he wasn\u2019t \u201cowed\u201d anything. \u201cThere are a million things I should have done better that night,\u201d he said before he was sentenced. Simon Glass said his family\u2019s grief was compounded at first by authorities initially describing his son as the aggressor in the standoff, which the sheriff\u2019s office later apologized for. He said he struggles with anxiety and has trouble referring to his son in the past tense, but takes comfort that his son\u2019s name has been cleared, in part because of body camera footage. Katie Glass said she and her mother try to always drive below the speed limit to avoid being pulled over by the police. She said she regrets watching the body camera footage showing her older brother\u2019s final moments. \u201cHe died terrified, in pain and all alone. That is what hurts me the most,\u201d she said. Buen, a former deputy in Clear Creek County, was convicted after a second trial. Nearly a year ago, another jury convicted him of a misdemeanor for recklessly putting other officers in danger by opening fire. However, jurors could not agree on a murder charge or a charge of official misconduct. With the support of Glass\u2019 family, prosecutors decided to try Buen again on a second-degree murder charge. Jurors also had the option of convicting him of the less serious charge of criminally negligent homicide. The defense argued that Glass had a knife and Buen was legally justified in shooting him to protect a fellow officer. After his SUV got stuck, Glass told a 911 dispatcher he was being followed. He also made other statements suggesting he was paranoid, hallucinating or delusional and experiencing a mental health crisis, according to Buen\u2019s indictment. When Buen and other officers arrived, Glass refused to get out. Video recorded by officers\u2019 body cameras showed him making heart shapes with his hands to the officers. The officers fired bean bag rounds and shocked Glass with a Taser, but that failed to make him exit the car. He then took a knife he had offered to surrender at the beginning of the encounter and flung it out a rear window, which had been broken by a bean bag, toward an officer, according to the indictment. At that point Buen fired five times at him. \u201cLord, hear me, Lord, hear me,\u201d Glass was heard saying moments before he was shot."

(Andres Martinez Casares/Pool Photo via AP) China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping started a week of diplomacy in Southeast Asia with a visit to Vietnam on Monday, signaling China\u2019s commitment to global trade, just after US President Donald Trump upended the global economy with his latest tariffs moves. Although Trump has paused some tariffs, China was the outlier, as he has kept in place 145% tariffs on the world\u2019s second-largest economy.

This is his third visit and comes just a year after he last visited in December 2023. The timing of the visit sends a \u201cstrong political message that Southeast Asia is important to China,\u201d said Huong Le-Thu at the International Crisis Group. She said that given the severity of Trump\u2019s tariffs and despite the 90-day pause, Southeast Asian nations were anxious that the tariffs, if implemented, could complicate their development. \u201cXi\u2019s trip is to showcase how China is the opposite to the coercive and self-interested U.S. There will be a lot of expectations about what type of leadership and initiatives China is going to come up with at this time of crisis,\u201d she said. In 2023, it was the only country that received both U.S. President Joe Biden and China\u2019s Xi Jinping. That year it also upgraded the U.S. to its highest diplomatic level, the same as China and Russia.

Yoon\u2019s declaration that martial law was needed in part to root out \u201canti-state\u201d elements was lifted six hours later after parliamentary staffers used barricades and fire extinguishers to ward off special operations soldiers trying to enter parliament, where lawmakers voted to reject martial law.

He conducted that historic task and exposed egregious abuses of taxpayer dollars,\u201d a senior administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

            "text": "The leader of Hungary's largest opposition party on Sunday told thousands of supporters that he would guide his country. (File Photo) The leader of Hungary\u2019s largest opposition party on Sunday told thousands of supporters that he would guide his country out of its international isolation if he defeats Prime Minister Viktor Orban in elections scheduled for next year. Peter Magyar, the leader of the Respect and Freedom (Tisza) party, represents the most serious challenge to Orban\u2019s power since the right-wing populist leader took power in 2010. Recent polling suggests that Tisza has overtaken Orban\u2019s Fidesz party as Hungary struggles with a stagnating economy and has been politically sidelined in the European Union over Orban\u2019s policies. Speaking at a rally in Budapest on Sunday, Magyar said that, if elected, he and his party would restore Hungary\u2019s relationships and reputation among its allies that have suffered as Orban has attacked the European Union and pursued close relationships with autocracies like Russia and China. \u201cWe will finally put our common affairs in order,\u201d Magyar said. \u201cOur homeland, Hungary, will once again be a proud and reliable ally of NATO. Hungary will once again be a full-fledged member of the European Union.\u201d Orban, a self-described \u201cilliberal\u201d leader, has been accused by critics of having led Hungary out of the community of European democracies by eroding democratic institutions, violating judicial independence and taking over much of Hungary\u2019s media. Since taking power in 2010, he and his Fidesz party have led the country with a two-thirds majority in parliament, and easily defeated any opposition. But recent polls suggest that Tisza has pulled ahead of Fidesz in popularity as Magyar\u2019s campaign focuses on economic and social issues facing the country like persistent inflation, a poor healthcare system and alleged government corruption. On Sunday, Magyar said Orban\u2019s system \u201ccannot be reformed, cannot be fixed, cannot be improved. This system can only be replaced, and that is what we will do \u2014 lawfully, democratically, but with determination, we will cut down the regime.\u201d Nora Farkas, a supporter of Magyar at the rally, said she had hoped for Orban\u2019s defeat in Hungary\u2019s last national elections in 2022, but that with around a year to go before the next ballot, she is more confident that change is possible. \u201cAnyone who thinks things are going well in this country is blind.

            "text": "The report on President Donald Trump's health after his physical on April 11, 2025, at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, released by the White House on behalf of his physician Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, is photographed Sunday, April 13, 2025. (AP) Donald Trump\u2019s doctor says the oldest man to be elected president is \u201cfully fit\u201d to serve as commander in chief as the White House released results of the physical exam Trump had Friday. The 78-year-old Trump is 20 pounds lighter since his last exam as president in 2020 showed him bordering on obesity. His physician, Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, cited an \u201cactive lifestyle\u201d that \u201dcontinues to contribute significantly\u201d to the Republican president\u2019s well-being. Trump turns 79 on June 14. In a three-page summary of the comprehensive exam, the doctor said Trump is \u201cfully fit to execute the duties of Commander-in-Chief and Head of State.\u201d Trump weighed 224 at the checkup, down from 244 at that physical more than four years ago. The summary noted that Trump previously had cataract surgery on both eyes, but did not include a date or dates. A common procedure among aging people, the surgery typically involves removing a cloudy eye lens and replacing it with an artificial lens to help clear up vision. In July 2024, according to the report, then-candidate Trump had a colonoscopy that found a benign polyp and the condition called diverticulosis. It\u2019s a common condition in which the walls of the intestine weaken with age. It can lead to inflammation, though most people with it never experience any problems. Trump again passed a Montreal Cognitive Assessment test, a short screening test to assess different brain functions, Barbabella wrote. The test includes remembering a list of spoken words and listening to a list of random numbers and repeating them backward, among other questions. Known as MoCA, it\u2019s the same test Trump took in 2018 and later recounted in an interview in which he described reciting a list of words in order: \u201cPerson. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.\u201d The president also was screened Friday for depression and anxiety, and had normal scores on questionnaires for those conditions, according to the report. Trump may be the oldest person elected to the nation\u2019s highest office, but he is four years behind Democrat Joe Biden, who was 82 when his presidential term ended in January. Barbabella wrote that Trump remains in \u201cexcellent health\u201d with \u201crobust\u201d cardiac, pulmonary, neurological and general physical function.\u201d The doctor said Trump\u2019s days include participating in multiple meetings, public appearances, media availabilities and \u201cfrequent victories in golf events.\u201d Trump is an avid golfer who said he recently won tournaments played at clubs he owns in Florida. Trump\u2019s cholesterol levels have improved over time, helped by the medications rosuvastatin and ezetimibe. At his physical in January 2018, his total cholesterol was 223. In early 2019, the reading came in at 196 and it stood at 167 in 2020. Today it is 140. Ideally, total cholesterol should be less than 200. His blood pressure was 128 over 74. That is considered elevated, and people in that situation are likely to develop high blood pressure unless steps are taken to control the condition. Trump has a resting heart rate of 62 beats per minute, in line with previous tests. A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 beats to 100 beats per minute, and generally, a lower rate implies better cardiovascular fitness. Trump also takes aspirin, which can reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke. The exam found minor sun damage to Trump\u2019s skin and a few benign lesions, but no concerning lesions or growth. It also confirmed scarring on Trump\u2019s right ear from a gunshot wound during an assassination attempt at a Butler, Pennsylvania, campaign rally in July 2024. Barbabella performed and supervised the medical examination of Trump and said it included diagnostic and laboratory testing in addition to consultations with 14 specialists Barbabella is also the third consecutive osteopathic doctor to serve as physician to the president, following Biden\u2019s doctor and one of the doctors who cared for Trump in his first term. Barbabella ran a naval health clinic in Havelock, North Carolina, before Trump tapped him for the job. TechnologyMicrosoft is testing \u201cHey, Copilot!\u201d wake command on Windows"

(Representational/File Photo) A Palestinian Red Crescent staff member who went missing in late March when 15 humanitarian workers were killed by Israeli fire is being detained by Israeli authorities, the rescue service and the Red Cross said on Sunday. Hisham Mhana, the spokesperson for the ICRC in Gaza, confirmed to Reuters that it had received information that the Palestine Red Crescent Society paramedic Assad Al-Nsasrah was being held in an Israeli place of detention. \u201cAs per standard practice, we informed the families immediately. In this case, we also informed the Palestine Red Crescent Society as they have special standing as a partner of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement,\u201d he said. The Israeli army did not immediately comment. Mhana said the ICRC has not been granted access to Nsasrah, who until Sunday had been declared missing, and also has not been able to visit any of the Palestinian detainees and prisoners in Israeli jails since October 7, 2023. In a post on X, The PRCS demanded the immediate release of Nsasrah, who it said was \u201cforcibly abducted\u201d while carrying out humanitarian duties. It added that Nsasrah and his colleagues came under heavy gunfire, which led to the killing of eight of them in a \u201cgrave violation\u201d of international humanitarian law. The bodies of 15 emergency and aid workers from the Red Crescent, the Civil Emergency Service and the UN were found buried in a mass grave in southern Gaza in March. The UN and the Red Crescent accused Israeli forces of killing them after they were dispatched to respond to reports of injuries from Israeli airstrikes. The Israeli military referred Reuters to its statement from Monday, in which it said that a thorough inquiry into the incident was still underway and that it would provide further details only once the investigation is complete. It said that a preliminary inquiry indicated that \u201cthe troops opened fire due to a perceived threat following a previous encounter in the area, and that six of the individuals killed in the incident were identified as Hamas terrorists\u201d. The Israeli military has provided no evidence of how it determined that the six were Hamas militants, and the Islamist faction has rejected the accusation.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Trump receives standing ovation as he enters UFC event in Miami President Donald Trump entered to a standing ovation and cheers from a crowd of thousands attending a UFC event on Saturday night, shaking hands with supporters against a backdrop of fans waving his trademark MAGA hats. Just as Trump entered, he greeted podcast host Joe Rogan, who sat to the right of the president. On the other side of Trump sat Elon Musk, billionaire and chief of the Department of Government Efficiency. Trump, who accented his dark suit with a bright yellow tie, pumped his fist in the air, prompting cheers to strains of \u201cTaking Care of Business\u201d. Trump entered the arena with UFC President Dana White, with whom he has been close for decades. He was also accompanied by his granddaughter, Kai Trump, the daughter of Donald Trump Jr. Throughout the fight, the UFC jumbotron frequently featured the president, drawing roars from the sold-out arena. The crowd periodically cheered \u201cUSA,\u201d and Trump briefly danced to the Village People\u2019s \u201cYMCA\u201d standing from his seat, firing up the crowd. In between fights, Trump would occasionally shake hands with people who approached him and lean in to speak to Musk, who at times held his son on his shoulders. The Republican president is a longtime UFC fan and sports enthusiast, who has frequently attended major fights. The mixed martial arts fight at Miami\u2019s Kaseya Centre was Trump\u2019s first UFC visit since he took office in January, and it came weeks after Trump attended the Saudi-sponsored LIV golf tournament at his golf club in Miami. In a further nod to his sports enthusiasm, Trump has also attended the Super Bowl and Daytona 500 since taking office. He sat cageside at a UFC championship fight in New York City last November, shortly after he won the 2024 election. It\u2019s the fourth UFC event in Miami, in a county that supported the president by about 11 percentage points in the November election. The president arrived in West Palm Beach on Friday for his 10th visit to South Florida since he became president, spending the evening in his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach. He flew to Miami after playing golf at his club in West Palm Beach. \u201cYou know who\u2019s going to win? Dana White. Dana White\u2019s gonna win,\u201d Trump told reporters Saturday night aboard Air Force One. His close affiliation with UFC helped boost his 2024 presidential campaign among young male voters prior to the November election, where he made promoting hypermasculine tones a signature of the campaign."

            "text": "\u201cThis is an abortion ban without banning abortion,\u201d said Julie Burkhart, founder and president of Wellspring Health Access. (Photo: AP) When a Wyoming woman phoned the state\u2019s only abortion clinic recently to make an appointment to end her pregnancy, she received news that complicated her life even more. Wellspring Health Access had stopped providing abortions that same day, responding to a slew of new requirements for the Casper clinic to become a licensed surgical center. \u201cIt was kind of really bad timing on my part,\u201d said the woman, who declined to be named because of abortion\u2019s stigma in her community. Though abortion remains legal in Wyoming, it has become increasingly difficult because of new requirements for abortion clinics and women seeking abortions. In this case, the woman had to go to Colorado, which partially borders southern Wyoming. On Wednesday, the Wyoming Supreme Court is set to hear arguments over state abortion bans that a lower court judge has suspended and struck down as unconstitutional. But even if the state high court agrees with those rulings, access to abortion in Wyoming stands to remain uncertain. New state laws make getting abortions much harder One new law targets Wellspring Health Access as Wyoming\u2019s only abortion clinic, requiring licensure as an outpatient surgical center at a cost of up to $500,000 in renovations, according to the clinic. The law also requires the clinic\u2019s physicians to get admitting privileges at a hospital within 10 miles (16 kilometers). A hospital three blocks from the clinic is under no obligation to admit its doctors, however. \u201cThis is an abortion ban without banning abortion,\u201d said Julie Burkhart, founder and president of Wellspring Health Access. A second new law requires women to get ultrasounds at least 48 hours before a medication abortion, costing them $250 or more plus gas money and travel time in a state where ultrasounds are unavailable in many rural areas. The Wyoming Legislature is well within its rights to regulate abortion to protect women from even the small chance of an abortion mishap, argued an attorney for the state, John Woykovsky, at a recent court hearing on the new laws. Unsettled abortion laws have far-reaching effects In most cases, a transvaginal ultrasound is required to obtain a fetal image in the earliest stages of pregnancy, when most abortions are done. That invasiveness, especially for victims of rape and abuse, caused Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican, to veto the ultrasound bill a few days after he signed the surgical center requirement into law Feb. 27. The Republican-dominated Legislature overrode his veto, leading Wellspring Health Access, the Wyoming abortion access advocate Chelsea\u2019s Fund and others to sue over it and the licensing law. Meanwhile, the legal uncertainty caused Wellspring Health Access, which opened in 2023 after an arson attack delayed the original date by almost a year, to halt both medication and surgical abortions. Several dozen abortion opponents attended a Tuesday hearing in Casper on whether to suspend the laws while the lawsuit moves ahead. If that happens, clinic abortions will resume, to the dismay of opponents, said Ross Schriftman, president of the local Wyoming Right to Life chapter. \u201cNo inspections, no confirmation of whether the people committing the abortions are licensed doctors for Wyoming and no continuity of care to the hospital,\u201d Schriftman said by email. Abortion proponents claim support among Wyoming women A former Wyoming resident who, in 2017, got an abortion in neighboring Colorado, her closest option at the time, sympathized with rural Wyoming women seeking abortions now. \u201cGod forbid it\u2019s the winter,\u201d said Ciel Newman, who now lives in New Mexico. \u201cWyoming\u2019s a huge, rural state without much interstate coverage.\u201d The amount of business at Wellspring Health Access shows that the lawmakers who passed the abortion laws are out of step with their constituents, Burkhart said. \u201cWe have had people coming in our doors each and every week that we\u2019ve been open,\u201d Burkhart said. \u201cIf people who come from Republican states, or more traditional-leaning states, didn\u2019t approve of abortion, we would go out of business because people just wouldn\u2019t show up.\u201d Is abortion access a Wyoming health care right? In the case about to be argued before the state Supreme Court, the same groups and women are suing over laws banning abortion that Wyoming has passed since 2022. They include the first explicit ban on medication abortions in the U.S. In November, a judge in Jackson ruled the bans violated a 2012 constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right of competent adults to make their own health care decisions. Even if the justices agree, Wellspring Health Access stands to suffer. Before the new laws, the clinic saw as many as 22 patients a day, 70% of whom were there for abortions: half surgical, half by pills. Now, Wellspring Health Access doesn\u2019t offer abortions and sees about five patients a day, all of whom are transgender people receiving hormone replacement therapy, according to the clinic. Twenty-three other states, including 14 that have not totally banned abortion, have passed requirements similar to Wyoming\u2019s that opponents call \u201ctargeted regulation of abortion providers,\u201d or TRAP, laws. Surgical center licensing and hospital admitting privileges are typical requirements, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that advocates for abortion access. Few states have passed TRAP laws since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, but abortion remains an unsettled issue in several. A licensing law in Missouri stood to curtail abortions until it was blocked by a judge, pointed out Kimya Forouzan, state policy advisor for the Guttmacher Institute. \u201cThey still have a major impact on the ability to provide care,\u201d Forouzan said in an email. An even longer drive to get an abortion The Wyoming woman recently seeking a surgical abortion at Wellspring Health Access had to drive more than twice as far from her hometown, more than four hours each way, to have the procedure at the Planned Parenthood in Fort Collins, Colorado. \u201cEven though I support abortion fully, it\u2019s not something that I thought I personally would ever do,\u201d the woman said, adding that Wellspring Health Access helped cover her costs. \u201cIt was a humbling experience,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just gave me a lot more compassion for people who have experienced abortions as well as people who aren\u2019t able to take that route.\u201d"

(Peter Byrne/Pool Photo via AP) The U.K. government took effective control Saturday of Britain\u2019s last remaining factory that makes steel from scratch from its Chinese owners, after lawmakers approved an emergency rescue. Prime Minister Keir Starmer summoned lawmakers for the unusual Saturday sitting, only the sixth since World War II, to back a bill primarily aimed at blocking British Steel\u2019s Chinese owners, Jingye Group, from closing the two massive blast furnaces at its Scunthorpe plant in the north of England that are key in the steelmaking process. The bill, which was debated over several hours and which is now law after being given royal ascent by King Charles III, gives Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds the power to direct the company\u2019s board and workforce, ensure its 3,000 workers get paid and order the raw materials necessary to keep the blast furnaces running. Jingye has said the Scunthorpe plant is losing 700,000 pounds ($910,000) a day as a result of challenging market conditions and increased environmental costs. The recent decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to impose a 25% tariffs on imported steel hasn\u2019t helped. After the House of Commons passed the bill on a voice vote, Starmer arrived in Scunthorpe to meet workers, who were clearly relieved that the town\u2019s steelmaking heritage, which stretches back around 150 years, has been preserved.

That would mean the U.K., which in the late 19th century was the world\u2019s steelmaking powerhouse, would be the only country in the Group of Seven industrial nations without the capacity to make its own steel from scratch rather than from recycled material, which use greener electric arc furnaces rather than blast furnaces. Reynolds criticized Jingye for making \u201cexcessive\u201d demands of the government in discussions in recent months, and that without the government\u2019s intervention, the company would have \u201cirrevocably and unilaterally closed down primary steel making at British Steel.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what role Jingye, owner of British Steel since 2020, will have in the day-to-day running of the steelworks. But should it fail to abide by the new laws, the company and its executives could face legal sanctions.

(Reuters) Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was transferred Saturday by medical aircraft from northeastern Brazil to the capital Brasilia after being hospitalized with abdominal pain a day earlier. Bolsonaro was hospitalized Friday morning while traveling in northeastern Brazil. The pain was caused by a bowel obstruction and was related to long-term effects of being stabbed in the abdomen in September 2018, his doctors said. Bolsonaro has been in and out of hospitals since the attack at a campaign event before Brazil\u2019s 2018 presidential election. The conservative leader underwent several surgeries during his presidency from 2019-2022. \u201cAfter so many similar episodes over the past few years, I had gotten used to the pain and discomfort. But this time, even the doctors were surprised,\u201d he said in a social media post Saturday, adding that a longtime physician told him it was \u201cthe most serious case since the attack.\u201d Bolsonaro also said he would likely undergo another surgery. Earlier on Saturday, doctors at Rio Grande Hospital in the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte told journalists he was stable and not in need of emergency surgery, said further procedures would depend on his recovery. Doctors also that the transfer to Brasilia was requested by his family and would happen Saturday afternoon. The far-right leader was admitted to a hospital in Santa Cruz, a small city in Rio Grande do Norte, and later transferred to a hospital in the state\u2019s capital, Natal. Bolsonaro was set to start a trip across the region to promote his party\u2019s right-wing agenda, eyeing next year\u2019s presidential election, though he himself is barred from running.

(Csaba Krizsan/MTI via AP) Authorities in several countries in Central Europe are working to contain an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease among cattle populations that has caused widespread border closures and required the killing of thousands of animals. The outbreak was first detected on a cattle farm in northwestern Hungary in early March, and animals on three farms in neighboring Slovakia tested positive for the highly transmissible virus two weeks later. Since then, animals from an additional three farms in Hungary and another three in Slovakia have tested positive for the virus, the first outbreak of the disease in either country in more than half a century. \u201cEverything is completely upside down\u201d in the area as farmers fear for their own herds and transportation is disrupted by border closures, said S\u00e1ndor Szoboszlai, a local entrepreneur and hunter in the Hungarian town of Lev\u00e9l where nearly 3,000 cattle had to be culled after the disease was discovered on a farm. A firefighter sprays a truck with disinfectant to try to prevent the spread of a the highly infectious foot-and-mouth disease from Slovakia at the border in Lanzhot, Czech Republic, Friday, April 11, 2025. (AP Photo/Petr David Josek) Foot-and-mouth disease primarily affects cloven-hooved animals like cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and deer, and results in fevers and blisters in the mouth and hooves. The virus spreads through contact between animals, or on surfaces like clothing, skin and vehicles, or on the wind. It poses little danger to humans. On Friday, authorities in Hungary continued to conduct operations aimed at stopping the spread of the disease and disinfecting affected farms and vehicles in the area. Mats doused in a powerful disinfectant were placed at the entrances and exits of towns and villages across the region to eliminate virus molecules that may cling to tires \u2014 though many of those mats quickly went dry and were swept partially off the road by passing vehicles. This week, the Slovakian government, citing insufficient containment measures by Hungary, closed 16 of their common borders and one with Austria, all of them lesser-trafficked crossings so authorities can focus on conducting border checks at the major ones. Last week, Austria \u2014 where there have been no reported cases \u2014 closed 23 of its border crossings with Hungary and Slovakia. Authorities in the Czech Republic, relatively distant from the Hungarian and Slovakian farms where the disease has been detected, have introduced disinfection measures at all the five border crossings used by freight trucks entering the country. Jiri Cerny, associate professor at the Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague, said the most significant risk of transmission is \u201cthrough contaminated human objects\u201d such as \u201dtires and cars, on the soles of shoes, and through contaminated food.\u201d The Czech Agriculture Minister, Marek V\u00fdborn\u00fd, has said the restrictions could be lifted 30 days after the last farm animal infected with foot-and-mouth disease has been culled in Slovakia. No new infections have been discovered in Hungary this week, and the cleanup of the last infected farms will likely be completed on Saturday, Istv\u00e1n Nagy, Hungary\u2019s agricultural minister said on Friday.

            "text": "Bihar govt announces incentives for giving employment opportunities to disabled & people of Bihar. (Special Arrangement) In a move to boost the state\u2019s tourism and hospitality sector, the Bihar government has amended its Tourism Policy 2023, making it more investment-friendly and to promote employment opportunities for people with disabilities. The changes announced on March 21 this year aim to attract greater private investment in hotel infrastructure and broaden the scope of incentives available under the policy. Tourism Minister Raju Kumar Singh, while addressing a press conference, said the state has reduced the minimum investment requirement for availing benefits under the tourism policy. Investors can now set up three-star and two-star hotels to qualify for incentives, a shift from the earlier provision that mandated a minimum Rs 10 crore investment in four-star hotels. \u201cAfter discussions with stakeholders, we decided to make the policy more flexible. The new provisions will encourage investment in untapped tourist destinations across the state,\u201d Singh added. In a boost to long-term investor confidence, the government has also extended SGST reimbursement from five years to seven years, acknowledging that hospitality projects take time to become operational. The policy also has a strong focus on employment generation. Hotels that employ locals will receive 100% ESI and EPF contributions or Rs 3,000 per employee per month, whichever is lower. Additionally, an incentive of Rs 1,500 per month will be provided for hiring disabled individuals from the state \u2014 a step that the government says reinforces its commitment to inclusive development and \u201cgrowth with justice.\u201d To further modernise Bihar\u2019s hospitality infrastructure, the government has floated Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for constructing hotels on three strategic sites \u2014 Hotel Patliputra Ashok, Bankipur Bus Stand, and Sultan Palace \u2014 under the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) mode. Tenders for these projects will be accepted until April 21, 2025. Pointing to the state\u2019s focus on religious and cultural tourism, Singh added that 50.50 acres of land at Punauradham in Sitamarhi, believed to be the birthplace of Sita, has been acquired for Rs 120.58 crore to develop tourism amenities. The government is also expected to further develop various tourism circuits, including the Ramayan, Buddhist, Sufi, Gandhi, Sikh, and Jain circuits, in an effort to showcase Bihar\u2019s rich heritage and boost visitor numbers.

(Reuters) Turkey on Thursday freed more than 120 people detained during last month\u2019s mass anti-government protests. Courts in Istanbul released on bail 127 defendants, most of them university students, who were arrested at their homes on March 24 after taking part in demonstrations sparked by the jailing of the city\u2019s opposition mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu. Imamoglu, who was arrested on March 19 on corruption and terrorism charges, is seen as the main challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s 22-year rule. His imprisonment has been widely viewed as politically motivated and sparked nationwide protests. The government insists Turkey\u2019s judiciary is independent and free of political influence. More than 2,000 people were detained for taking part in the country\u2019s largest mass demonstrations in more than a decade. Of those, some 300 were jailed awaiting trial. Those freed on Thursday are charged with participating in banned protests. One court released 102 suspects, many of them students with upcoming exams, after considering the time they had spent in prison, the low risk of absconding and on condition of not traveling abroad. A separate court released a further 25 people on condition that they report to police regularly. The releases follow a campaign by parents to have their children set free, with many holding daily vigils outside a prison in Silivri, west of Istanbul. Among those released was prominent demonstrator Berkay Gezgin, a 22-year-old student who met Imamoglu on the campaign trail in 2019 and coined the slogan \u201cEverything will be fine,\u201d which the Istanbul mayor later used in his campaign. The defendants\u2019 cases will be heard in June and September at Istanbul\u2019s Caglayan Courthouse."

(AP Photo) The United Arab Emirates argued at the UN\u2019s top court on Thursday that it has no jurisdiction to rule on a claim of genocide lodged by Sudan. The UAE told the judges at the International Court of Justice that the allegations the country is breaching the genocide convention by arming and funding the rebel paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces were a misuse of the institution. Sudan wants The Hague-based court to issue emergency orders, known as provisional measures, including telling the UAE to do all it can to prevent the killing and other crimes targeting the Masalit people. \u201cThe idea that the UAE is somehow the driver of this reprehensible conflict in Sudan could not be further from the truth,\u201d said Reem Ketait, a senior official at the UAE\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She described the case as \u201cthe most recent iteration of the applicant\u2019s misuse of our international institutions as a stage from which to attack the UAE.\u201d Both Sudan and the UAE are signatories to the 1948 genocide convention. The United Arab Emirates, however, has a caveat to part of the treaty which legal experts say makes it unlikely that the case will proceed. \u201cThe ICJ has previously said that this kind of reservation is allowed and is a barrier to a case going forward. The court is most likely to say the same thing in this case, meaning that this case will not go forward,\u201d Melanie O\u2019Brien, an associate professor of international law at the University of Western Australia and an expert on the convention, told The Associated Press. Sudan descended into a deadly conflict in mid-April 2023 when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary rebels broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions. Both the Rapid Support Forces and Sudan\u2019s military have been accused of abuses. The UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula and a US ally, has been repeatedly accused of arming the RSF, something it has strenuously denied despite evidence to the contrary. Conflict Observatory, a monitoring group which is funded by the US State Department, has identified aircraft it says carried UAE arms transfers to the RSF. Those flights went through Mar\u00e9chal Idriss Deby international airport in Amdjarass, Chad. The UAE says the purpose of the flights was to support a local hospital. In January, the US Treasury Department announced that RSF leader Mohammad Hamdan Daglo Mousa, also known as Hemedti, had been targeted for sanctions along with seven RSF-owned companies in the United Arab Emirates. That came as the US declared the RSF rebels are committing genocide. The Sudanese Armed Forces have broadly retaken Khartoum from the RSF.

Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, led the liberal Democratic Party\u2019s campaign to oust the former president over his December declaration of martial law. Lee recently stepped down as the party\u2019s chairman to focus on campaigning for the June 3 election. He is considered the clear frontrunner in party\u2019s primary. Kim Dong-yeon, the Democratic governor of Gyeonggi province and a longtime financial policymaker, also told reporters Wednesday that he intends to run for president. Yoon\u2019s downfall has left the conservative People Power Party in disarray, with roughly 10 politicians expected to seek the nomination, reflecting a split between Yoon loyalists, who still control the party\u2019s leadership, and reformists calling for a fresh start.

He promised aggressive government spending to jolt economic growth and ease income polarization. Lee said it was crucial to maintain a robust alliance with the United States and to pursue three-way cooperation with Japan, but he stressed that South Korea\u2019s national interest should come first in \u201cevery decision.\u201d Lee, who has served as a lawmaker, provincial governor and city mayor, is adored by supporters for his outspoken style and has long positioned himself as an anti-elitist.

Lee also has his own set of legal troubles, facing five different trials for corruption and other criminal charges. Earlier this month, the Constitutional Court upheld Yoon\u2019s impeachment by the legislature and formally removed him from office over the martial law decree, triggering a presidential by-election within 60 days. The next president will serve a full 5-year term. Former PPP leader Han Dong-hoon, who heads the party\u2019s anti-Yoon faction, was expected to announce his presidential bid on Thursday. Among the conservatives\u2019 presidential hopefuls, former Labor Minister Kim Moon Soo is considered to be the most pro-Yoon. Kim, Daegu Mayor Hong Joon-pyo and senior PPP lawmaker Ahn Cheol-soo \u2014 a former computer software entrepreneur and three-time presidential candidate \u2014 have declared their intentions to run for president.

            "text": "A woman walks by a Cornell University sign on the Ivy League school's campus in Ithaca, New York. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, File) The Trump administration has frozen over $1 billion in funding for Cornell University and $790 million for Northwestern University while it investigates both schools over civil rights violations, a U.S. official said on Tuesday. The funding being paused includes mostly grants and contracts with the federal departments of health, education, agriculture and defense, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The administration of US President Donald Trump has threatened to block federal funding for schools over pro-Palestinian campus protests as well as other issues such as diversity, equity and inclusion programs and transgender policies. Last month, it sent a letter to 60 universities, including Cornell and Northwestern, that it could bring enforcement actions if a review determined the schools had failed to stop what it called antisemitism. Northwestern said it was aware of media reports about the funding freeze but had not received any official notification from the government and that it has cooperated in the investigation. \u201cFederal funds that Northwestern receives drive innovative and life-saving research, like the recent development by Northwestern researchers of the world\u2019s smallest pacemaker, and research fueling the fight against Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This type of research is now in jeopardy,\u201d a Northwestern spokesperson said. Cornell did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In an opinion piece in the New York Times last week, Cornell President Michael Kotlikoff said his university was not afraid to let people argue, including over issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Trump has attempted to crack down on pro-Palestinian campus protests against U.S. ally Israel\u2019s devastating military assault on Gaza, which has caused a humanitarian crisis in the enclave and followed a deadly October 2023 attack by Islamist group Hamas. Also Read | Trump calls Columbia University arrest \u2018first of many\u2019 in campus protest crackdown Human rights advocates have raised free speech and academic freedom concerns over the crackdown by the Trump administration. Last week, the U.S. government announced a review of $9 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard University and has since listed conditions it must meet to receive federal money. Princeton University also said last week the government froze dozens of research grants. Last month, the Trump administration canceled $400 million in funding for Columbia University, the epicenter of last year\u2019s pro-Palestinian campus protests. Columbia agreed to some significant changes that Trump\u2019s administration demanded for talks about restoring the funding. Federal agents have also detained some foreign student protesters in recent weeks from different campuses and are working to deport them. And the government has revoked visas of many foreign students. In March, the Trump administration suspended $175 million in funding to the University of Pennsylvania over its transgender sports policies."

            "text": "Student negotiator Mahmoud Khalil is seen at a pro-Palestinian protest encampment on the Columbia University campus in New York. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, File) An immigration judge on Tuesday gave the US government a day to show evidence that Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil should be deported and said she would rule on the case on Friday, a month after his arrest in New York and transfer to a rural Louisiana jail 1,200 miles (1,931.21 km) away. \u201cIf he\u2019s not removable, I\u2019m going to be terminating this case on Friday,\u201d Assistant Chief Immigration Judge Jamee Comans said during a hearing at the LaSalle Immigration Court in Jena, Louisiana. If the government\u2019s deportation case is terminated at the hearing scheduled for Friday afternoon, Khalil, 30, is free under immigration law. The government cannot challenge the termination, but if the judge terminates the case without prejudice it can attempt to file the removal case again. Khalil sat at a table in the courtroom, wrapping prayer beads around his right hand as he listened to his attorney Marc Van Der Hout appear remotely from California on a nearby screen to tell the court he had not received a single document of the government\u2019s evidence. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more important to this court than Mr. Khalil\u2019s due process rights,\u201d Comans told Van Der Hout after he asked for more time to review the government\u2019s evidence. \u201cI\u2019m also not going to keep Mr. Khalil detained while attorneys go back and forth about documents.\u201d Department of Homeland Security lawyers told Comans they would provide the evidence by her 5 p.m. Wednesday deadline. In a statement later, Khalil\u2019s attorney Van Der Hout said he was concerned the judge would rule without giving the defense time to respond to the government\u2019s case, a concern he had raised earlier in court. \u201cWhat this case is really about is whether lawful permanent residents \u2014 and other immigrants to this country \u2014 can speak out about what is happening in Gaza, or any other important matters of discussion in the national discourse without fear of deportation for expressing beliefs that are completely protected by the First Amendment,\u201d Van Der Hout said. \u201cAre US citizens going to be next?\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s administration says it has revoked Khalil\u2019s status as a lawful permanent resident under a 1952 law allowing the deportation of any immigrant whose presence in the country the secretary of state deems harmful to US foreign policy. The US government also has said the pro-Palestinian demonstrator should be forced out from the country because he withheld information from his application for a green card, which he has denied. The immigration case is separate from a challenge to the legality of his March arrest, known as a habeas corpus petition. A US district judge hearing Khalil\u2019s habeas petition has ruled that he must remain in the U.S. for now while he considers Khalil\u2019s petition to either free him or move him to New Jersey. If Comans rules on Friday that Khalil can be deported, he would then be able to ask her to rule on whether he is eligible for \u201crelief from removal,\u201d which can be granted in limited cases, including a fear of persecution in the immigrant\u2019s home country. Khalil can also appeal her rulings. Since Khalil\u2019s arrest Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said he has revoked the visas of hundreds of foreign students. The Trump administration says college protests against U.S. military support for Israel have included harassment of Jewish students. Khalil, a Palestinian born in a refugee camp in Syria, has called himself a political prisoner. His lawyers have argued the Trump administration improperly targeted him for his political views in violation of his right to free speech guaranteed by the US Constitution\u2019s First Amendment. Khalil\u2019s wife, Noor Abdalla, is a US citizen, and due to give birth to their first child this month. She has not been able to travel to Louisiana to visit him due to her pregnancy. The hearing had been delayed nearly a half hour because the judge could not find some of Khalil\u2019s lawyers among what she said was nearly 600 people trying to access the video feed, evidence of the high interest in the case. The judge allowed in only lawyers and, at Khalil\u2019s request, his wife."

(Reuters) US traffic deaths fell 3.8% in 2024 to 39,345, the lowest number since 2020, but fatalities on American roads remained above pre-Covid levels, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on Tuesday. Last year marks the first time since 2020 that annual deaths involving vehicles dropped below 40,000 but they are still drastically higher than the 36,355 killed in 2019, the agency said as it released preliminary data. Final 2023 figures showed the number of bicyclists killed increased 4.4% to 1,166, the most since at least 1980, the NHTSA said. The number injured rose 8.2% to nearly 50,000. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see that traffic fatalities are continuing to fall from their Covid pandemic highs,\u201d NHTSA Chief Counsel Peter Simshauser said. \u201cTotal road fatalities, however, remain significantly higher than a decade ago, and America\u2019s traffic fatality rate remains high relative to many peer nations.\u201d In 2022, the number of pedestrians killed in the U.S. rose 0.7% to 7,522, the most since 1981. That number declined 3.7% in 2023 to 7,314, NHTSA said. The number of people injured in motor vehicle crashes rose 2.5% to nearly 2.2 million in 2023. US traffic deaths jumped 10.8% in 2021 to 43,230, the most in a single year since 2005. The number of pedestrians and cyclists killed on American roads rose to the highest number in more than four decades. As US roads became less crowded during the pandemic, some motorists perceived police as less likely to issue tickets, experts said, resulting in riskier driving. The 2024 fatality rate dropped to 1.20 per 100 million vehicle miles traveled \u2014 the lowest since 2019, but still above the 1.13 average rate in the seven years before Covid.

According to two senior White House officials, Trump will use his emergency authority to allow some older coal-fired power plants set for retirement to keep producing electricity to meet rising US power demand amid growth in data centers, artificial intelligence and electric cars. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue before the president\u2019s announcement, expected Tuesday afternoon.

            "text": "The dollar index, which measures the US currencies against six other units, was 0.44% lower on Tuesday. (Source: File Photo) Safe havens the yen and the Swiss franc held near six-month highs on Tuesday while the US dollar nursed broad losses as financial markets grappled with mounting recession worries in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs. Currency markets were fragile but eerily calm in Asian trade after a volatile 24 hours where the dollar reversed heavy losses against the safe haven currencies as traders took stock of developments. Global shares have plummeted since Trump announced tariffs last week. China and the European Union swiftly hit back by proposing higher tariffs of their own, which Trump in turn threatened to fight with even higher duties. In currencies, investors have flocked to the Japanese yen and Swiss franc in the past week, seeking shelter from the market turmoil. The yen was last slightly stronger at 147.325 per US dollar, near the six-month high of 144.82 touched on Friday. The Swiss franc last fetched 0.85665 per dollar, also close to a six-month high touched in the previous session. While the dollar is typically known as a safe-haven asset, that status appears to be eroding as uncertainty over tariffs grows, stoking fears that U.S. growth could stutter. The euro rose 0.58% to $1.0967, not far from the six-month high it hit last week, while sterling was 0.4% higher at $1.2776, inching away from the previous session\u2019s one-month low. \u201cThe current volatility is entirely the result of the policy choices of the Trump administration, meaning that, if reversed, the impact on financial markets will likely reverse as well,\u201d said Nathan Lim, chief investment officer at Lonsec Investment Solutions. Investors are wagering that the rising risk of an economic downturn could lead to a cut in US interest rates as early as May and, with more easing priced in this year, that would erode the dollar\u2019s yield advantage. The dollar index, which measures the US currencies against six other units, was 0.44% lower on Tuesday. The index is down over 1% since the tariffs were announced. Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Austan Goolsbee on Monday said while businesses are anxious about the tariffs, the central bank would need to look at \u201chard data\u201d in its policy response. Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said the Fed is still constrained from acting by relatively sticky inflation. \u201cI don\u2019t see how, or why, aggressive rate cuts by the Fed would solve this, however, or where we get the kind of monetary or fiscal stimulus that typically arrives on the scene halfway through, or toward the end of, a bear market,\u201d Gordon said. The risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars have dropped against their US counterpart in the past week but rose on Tuesday. The Aussie was 1% stronger at $0.6052, but stayed close to the five-year low it touched on Monday. The kiwi also rose 1% to $0.5606 ahead of a policy meeting on Wednesday, where New Zealand\u2019s central bank is expected to cut rates. China\u2019s yuan fell to its weakest level since 2023 after the central bank slightly loosened its grip on the currency in what analysts said was an attempt counteract the blow to exports from an intensifying trade war. In emerging markets, the Indonesian rupiah sank to a record low when markets resumed trading after a public holiday. James Athey, fixed income manager at Marlborough, said people are still hopeful that the most punitive tariffs can be negotiated down but noted that there are still downside risks. \u201cHow and where we end are going to be a function of tariff negotiations, key economic data and central bank responses. If defensive equity sectors start to underperform, that will suggest we\u2019ve moved into sell-everything mode.\u201d"

            "text": "The system also contains records of patients' personal identification information, medical appointments and billing information. However, it does not contain patients' medical histories or records. (Representational photo) A senior Indian-origin patient service associate at Singapore\u2019s National University Hospital (NUH) was fined SGD 3,800 after she pleaded guilty to one count of misusing a computer system by accessing records of a patient. Pubaneswary Poobalan, 39, accessed the hospital\u2019s SAP system \u2013 a platform that enables healthcare institutions to perform day-to-day business processes such as maintaining patients\u2019 records, appointment scheduling and billing, The Straits Times reported on Monday. The system also contains records of patients\u2019 personal identification information, medical appointments and billing information. However, it does not contain patients\u2019 medical histories or records. Court documents stated that Pubaneswary, a Singaporean who is no longer working for NUH, had received several anonymous letters at her home between June and August 2023. Pubaneswary then assumed that a certain woman, referred to as \u201cthe victim\u201d, was the one who had sent the letters. This was because the woman, who also cannot be named due to a gag order, knew people in the healthcare industry who could help her obtain Pubaneswary\u2019s home address. In October 2023, Pubaneswary spoke to the witness who rejected her assumptions as he did not believe the victim had the offender\u2019s home address. An argument then broke out between Pubaneswary and the man. Performing night duty at NUH on Oct 23, 2023, Pubaneswary accessed the SAP system. Deputy Public Prosecutor Samuel Chew said that as a senior patient service associate, she was allowed to access the system to manage patients\u2019 appointments and billings. However, she was not supposed to access the records of patients that did not fall within her purview. Despite this, she searched for the victim\u2019s records by keying in the latter\u2019s first name and date of birth. The search led to a total of four results, one of which was related to the victim. DPP Chew told the court, \u201cThe accused then accessed the victim\u2019s records, and video-recorded the victim\u2019s NRIC number, full name, date of birth, address and contact numbers. \u201cThe accused\u2026 video-recorded her entire act, as she wanted to prove to the witness that the victim had the capability of obtaining her home address.\u201d Following an online complaint from the victim on May 14, 2024, NUH conducted an internal investigation and Pubaneswary admitted that she had accessed the victim\u2019s records on the SAP system without authority. The hospital said it had taken immediate action to file a police report and notify the Ministry of Health. An NUH spokesperson added, \u201cWe have taken immediate steps to request that the involved parties delete the relevant data in their possession. We deeply regret this incident.\u201d \u201cProtecting and upholding the confidentiality of patient information is paramount to us, and we do not tolerate the violation of this trust,\u201d the Singapore daily quoted the spokesperson as saying. \u2018What sort of statements are you making\u2019: SC to MP minister over remarks on Col Qureshi Trending\u2018We will have to be humble\u2019: Chandigarh acid attack survivor scores 95.6% in Class 12 CBSE boards, aspires to be an IAS officer OpinionIn the aftermath of Pahalgam, India must look at itself again How Op Sindoor demonstrates capabilities of Made in India defence Trending\u2018We will have to be humble\u2019: Chandigarh acid attack survivor scores 95.6% in Class 12 CBSE boards, aspires to be an IAS officer"

            "text": "Staff Sgt. Travis Snyder, left, receives the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine given at Madigan Army Medical Center at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state, south of Seattle. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) The Army has reenlisted more than 23 soldiers who were discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine, officials said Monday, rushing to implement President Donald Trump\u2019s order that troops be rehired and given back pay. Three people rejoined active duty Army service, and more than 20 came back either to the National Guard or the Reserve, the Army said. The soldiers have signed their contracts and were sworn in, and the active duty troops were reporting to their units, the Army said. None of the other services has completed reenlistments yet, but all are reaching out to former troops. The Marine Corps, Air Force, Army and Navy set up new websites on Monday to provide information for service members looking to reenlist. And they are sending letters and emails and making calls to those who were discharged. Trump has argued that the vaccine mandate wrongly pushed troops out and suggested that many would return. In an executive order signed a week after he took office, Trump said the vaccine mandate cost the military \u201csome of our best people\u201d and he vowed to \u201crehire every patriot who was fired from the military with \u2026 backpay.\u201d Those who may have been attracted by the offer of back pay will likely get far less money than they initially thought when Trump announced his plan. Under the details of the Pentagon offer, any wages earned during their time as civilians would be deducted from the back pay total, along with other payments they may have received. The Pentagon made the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory in August 2021 for all service members, including those in the National Guard and Reserve. Then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said getting the vaccine was critical to maintaining a healthy, ready force. The Pentagon dropped the mandate in January 2023. The initial reenlistments come as the Pentagon last week formally increased the new minimum service commitment from two to four years for those discharged for refusing a lawful order to take the vaccine. A Feb. 7 memo sent to the secretaries of the military services said troops would be required to sign up for two years. But a memo signed April 1 by Jules Hurst III, who is doing the job of defense undersecretary for personnel, said \u201creinstatement will not be afforded to those who are unwilling or unable to return to active service or active status, as applicable, for four years.\u201d The Army said the bulk of the soldiers who reenlisted were those ordered out for refusing the shot, and they signed on for four years. They will be entitled to get some back pay. Several, however, left the Army voluntarily to avoid the shot, so they are allowed to reenlist for two years and will not get back pay. According to the new memo, there is an exception for anyone who would have been eligible for retirement within two years of the date they were originally discharged. Those service members also can reenlist for at least two years. Roughly 8,200 troops were discharged for refusing to obey the vaccine order. They have been allowed to rejoin since 2023, but that did not include any back pay. Just 113 reenlisted. The Army and Marine Corps have been sending out emails, texts and phone calls to service members for several weeks. The Navy and the Air Force had been waiting for the additional guidance. According to Army spokesman Christopher Surridge, about 400 soldiers have inquired so far about the reenlistment program. Of those, about 100 are in the application process. The Army did not have estimates on how much it has given the soldiers in total back pay. As of Friday, 472 Marines have indicated interest in learning more about returning. The Navy said about a half dozen sailors had so far expressed interest or sought more information, and the Air Force said it had not yet gotten any feedback from service members. The limited interest reflects what service leaders said early on, which was that many troops used the vaccine as a reason to leave and have moved on with their lives. According to the memo, the services must provide each person with an estimate of the amount of back pay they will receive. Service members will then have 60 days to decide whether to reenlist. Everyone who wants to reenlist must meet all military standards, including health, fitness and moral requirements. Service members have until Feb. 28, 2026, to seek reinstatement."

            "text": "Under the order issued on April 2, CBP personnel at all US ports of entry are required to detain sea salt products sourced from the farm. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock) The United States has blocked imports of sea salt products from a major South Korean salt farm accused of using slave labor, becoming the first trade partner to take punitive action against a decadeslong problem on salt farms in remote islands off South Korea\u2019s southwest coast. US Customs and Border Protection issued a withhold release order against the Taepyung salt farm, saying information \u201creasonably indicates\u201d the use of forced labor at the company in the island county of Sinan, where most of South Korea\u2019s sea salt products are made. Under the order issued on April 2, CBP personnel at all US ports of entry are required to detain sea salt products sourced from the farm. Taepyung is the largest salt farm in Sinan, reportedly producing about 16,000 tons of salt annually, which accounts for approximately 6% of the country\u2019s total output, and is a major supplier to South Korean food companies. The farm, located on Jeungdo island in Sinan and leasing most of its salt fields to tenants, has been repeatedly accused of using forced labour, including in 2014 and 2021. The widespread slavery at Sinan\u2019s salt farms was exposed in 2014, when dozens of slavery victims \u2014 most of them with disabilities \u2014 were rescued from the islands following an investigation by mainland police. Some of their stories were documented by The Associated Press, which highlighted how slavery continued to thrive despite the exposure. CBP said it identified several signs of forced labor during its investigation of Taepyung, including \u201cabuse of vulnerability, deception, restriction of movement, retention of identity documents, abusive living and working conditions, intimidation and threats, physical violence, debt bondage, withholding of wages, and excessive overtime.\u201d Lawyer Choi Jung Kyu, part of a group of attorneys and activists who petitioned CBP to take action against Taepyung and other South Korean salt farms in 2022, expressed hope that the US export ban would increase pressure on South Korea to take more effective steps to eliminate the slavery. \u201cSince the exposure of the problem in 2014, the courts have recognized the legal responsibility of the national government and local governments, but forced labor among salt farm workers has not been eradicated,\u201d Choi said. \u201cOur hope is that the export ban would force companies to strengthen due diligence over supply chains and lead to the elimination of human rights violations.\u201d Most of the salt farm slaves rescued in 2014 had been lured to the islands by \u201cman hunters\u201d and job brokers hired by salt farm owners, who would beat them into long hours of hard labour and confine them at their houses for years while providing little or no pay. The slavery was revealed in early 2014 when two police officers from the capital, Seoul, came to one of the Sinan islands disguised as tourists and pulled off a clandestine operation to rescue a victim who had been reported by his family as missing. One of the Seoul police officers told the AP they went undercover because of concerns about collaborative ties between the island\u2019s police and salt farm owners. Dozens of farm owners and job brokers were indicted, but no police or officials were punished despite allegations some knew about the slavery. In 2019, South Korea\u2019s Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling that ordered the government to compensate three men who had been enslaved on Sinan\u2019s salt farms, acknowledging that local officials and police failed to properly monitor their living and working conditions. The salt farm slavery issue resurfaced in 2021 when around a dozen workers at Taepyung were discovered to have endured various labour abuses, including forced labour and delayed payments."

            "text": "A vehicle carries the coffin of a commander from Iraq's Kataib Hezbollah armed group who was killed in what they called a \"Zionist attack\" in the Syrian capital Damascus on Friday, during a funeral in Baghdad, Iraq. REUTERS/Thaier Al-Sudani/File Photo Several powerful Iranian-backed militia groups in Iraq are prepared to disarm for the first time to avert the threat of an escalating conflict with the U.S. Trump administration, 10 senior commanders and Iraqi officials told Reuters. The move to defuse tensions follows repeated warnings issued privately by U.S. officials to the Iraqi government since Trump took power in January, according to the sources who include six local commanders of four major militias. The officials told Baghdad that unless it acted to disband the militias operating on its soil, America could target the groups with airstrikes, the people added. Izzat al-Shahbndar, a senior Shi\u2019ite Muslim politician close to Iraq\u2019s governing alliance, told Reuters that discussions between Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and several militia leaders were \u201cvery advanced\u201d, and the groups were inclined to comply with U.S. calls for disarmament. \u201cThe factions are not acting stubbornly or insisting on continuing in their current form,\u201d he said, adding that the groups were \u201cfully aware\u201d they could be targeted by the U.S. The six militia commanders interviewed in Baghdad and a southern province, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive situation, are from the Kataib Hezbollah, Nujabaa, Kataib Sayyed al-Shuhada and Ansarullah al-Awfiyaa groups. \u201cTrump is ready to take the war with us to worse levels, we know that, and we want to avoid such a bad scenario,\u201d said a commander of Kataib Hezbollah, the most powerful Shi\u2019ite militia, who spoke from behind a black face mask and sunglasses. The commanders said their main ally and patron, Iran\u2019s elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) military force, had given them its blessing to take whatever decisions they deemed necessary to avoid being drawn into a potentially ruinous conflict with the United States and Israel. The militias are part of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of about 10 hardline Shi\u2019ite armed factions that collectively command about 50,000 fighters and arsenals that include long-range missiles and anti-aircraft weapons, according to two security officials who monitor militias\u2019 activities. The Resistance group, a key pillar of Iran\u2019s network of regional proxy forces, have claimed responsibility for dozens of missile and drone attacks on Israel and U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since the Gaza war erupted about 18 months ago. Farhad Alaaeldin, Sudani\u2019s foreign affair adviser, told Reuters in response to queries about disarmament talks that the prime minister was committed to ensuring all weapons in Iraq were under state control through \u201cconstructive dialogue with various national actors\u201d. The two Iraqi security officials said Sudani was pressing for disarmament from all the militias of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which declare their allegiance to Iran\u2019s IRGC or Quds Force rather than to Baghdad. Some groups have already largely evacuated their headquarters and reduced their presences in major cities including Mosul and Anbar since mid-January for fear of being hit by air attacks, according to officials and commanders. The U.S. State Department said it continued to urge Baghdad to rein in the militias. \u201cThese forces must respond to Iraq\u2019s commander-in-chief and not to Iran,\u201d it added. An American official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, cautioned that there had been instances in the past when the militias had ceased their attacks because of U.S. pressure, and was sceptical any disarmament would be long-term. The IRGC declined to comment for this article while the Iranian and Israeli foreign ministries didn\u2019t respond to queries. Shahbndar, the Shi\u2019ite politician, said the Iraqi government had not yet finalised a deal with militant leaders, with a disarmament mechanism still under discussion. Options being considered include turning the groups into political parties and integrating them into the Iraqi armed forces, he added. While the fate of any disarmament process remains uncertain, the discussions nonetheless mark the first time the militias have been prepared to give ground to longstanding Western pressure to demilitarize. The shift comes at a precarious time for Tehran\u2019s regional \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d which it has established at great cost over decades to oppose Israel and U.S. influence but has seen severely weakened since Palestinian group Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel on October 7 2023 tipped the Middle East into conflict. Iraq is seeking to balance its alliances with both America and Iran in its dealing with the militias on its soil. The groups sprang up across the country with Iranian financial and military support in the chaotic wake of the 2003 U.S. invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, and have become formidable forces that can rival the national army in firepower. The Iraqi-based militias had launched dozens of drone and rockets attacks against Israel in solidarity with Hamas since the Gaza war began and killed three U.S. soldiers in a drone operation in Jordan near the Syrian border last year. Ibrahim al-Sumaidaie, a former political adviser to Sudani, told Iraqi state TV that the United States had long pressed Iraq\u2019s leadership to dismantle Shi\u2019ite militias, but this time Washington might not take no for an answer."

(File representational image) A doctor accused of trying to kill his wife on a Hawaii hiking trail is scheduled to be arraigned in court Monday on an attempted murder charge. Gerhardt Konig\u2019s wife says they were hiking in Honolulu last month when he grabbed her, pushed her toward the edge of a cliff, attempted to inject her with a syringe and then bashed her head with a rock, the woman wrote in a petition for a temporary restraining order against him. Since his indictment March 28, Konig has been held without bail. An attorney who represented him during an initial court appearance has not responded to an email seeking comment. If convicted, he could face life in prison. The couple were visiting Oahu to celebrate her birthday while their two young sons stayed home on Maui with a nanny and family, according to the wife\u2019s petition filed in family court. A judge signed an order saying Konig must stay away from his wife and their children. The petition for a restraining order said that in December, Konig accused his wife of having an affair. They have since been in therapy and counseling, she said. In the petition, she also said her husband has sexually abused and assaulted her. On March 24 during their recent trip, Konig suggested they go on a hike in Honolulu that she described in the petition as having \u201cnarrow ridge sections with steep drop-offs on both sides.\u201d \u201cGerhardt hiked a little further and then came back to get me.\u201d At one point, he grabbed the woman by her upper arms and started pushing her toward the cliff\u2019s edge while yelling that he was sick of her, she said. They began wrestling and she screamed and pleaded for him to stop, fearing for her life, the petition said.During the struggle, she said he took a syringe from his bag and tried to inject her. \u201cI do not know what was in the syringe, but Gerhardt is an anesthesiologist and has access to several potentially lethal medications as part of his employment,\u201d she said, adding that she bit his arm in an attempt to defend herself. He appeared to calm down, but then grabbed a nearby rock and \u201cbegan bashing me repeatedly on the head with it,\u201d she said. Two women on the trail saw what was happening and said they were calling 911. The women helped her down the trail while Konig went in another direction. An ambulance took her to a hospital and her husband was arrested that evening. Konig is an anesthesiologist at Maui Health, which operates hospitals and clinics in Maui County and is an affiliate of Kaiser Permanente. Maui Health said in a statement to media organizations that he was suspended pending investigation. Kaiser Permanente said in a statement that Konig is not an employee, but is employed by an independent entity contracted to provide medical services. Kaiser said it has suspended his credentials and ability to treat patients pending investigation."

Nationwide, the US. has more than double the number of measles cases it saw in all of 2024. More than two months in, the West Texas outbreak is believed to have spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas, sickening nearly 570 people. The World Health Organization also reported cases related to Texas in Mexico. The number of cases in Texas shot up by 81 between March 28 and April 4, and 16 more people were hospitalized. A team from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is on the ground in Texas assisting with outbreak response. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has delivered a tepid message on the importance of vaccination against measles, saying it should be encouraged while also sowing doubt in the vaccine\u2019s safety. The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine has been used safely for more than 60 years and is 97% effective against measles after two doses. Misinformation about how to prevent and treat measles is hindering a robust public health response, including claims about vitamin A supplements that have been pushed by Kennedy and holistic medicine supporters despite doctors\u2019 warnings that it should be given under a physician\u2019s orders and that too much can be dangerous. Doctors at Covenant Children\u2019s Hospital in Lubbock, where the first measles death occurred, say they\u2019ve treated fewer than 10 children for liver issues from vitamin A toxicity, which they found when running routine lab tests on under vaccinated children who have measles.

Ozgur Ozel was reelected at an extraordinary congress of the Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP, which he called to prevent what he said was a plot by the government to appoint a caretaker for the party. The arrest of Istanbul\u2019s opposition Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu on corruption charges has ignited large-scale anti-government protests. Imamoglu had emerged as the main challenger to Erdogan\u2019s 22-year rule since he was elected mayor of Istanbul in 2019, overturning a quarter-century of rule by parties from Turkey\u2019s conservative Islamist tradition. The opposition claims the charges against Imamoglu are politically motivated, but the government insists the judiciary is independent and free of political interference.

Critics say the charges are an excuse to get a key rival out of the way, but the government denies interfering with the legal process. The largest protests have happened alongside rallies of Imamoglu\u2019s center-left pro-secularist Republican People\u2019s Party, known as the CHP, but many young protesters said they don\u2019t support the party. Ogulcan Akti, a 26-year-old university student working two part-time jobs to support his family, said both the opposition and the ruling party are \u201cliars.\u201d \u201cThe ones in power and the opposition that will come later, they\u2019re all the same,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t trust anyone.\u201d In the days after the mayor\u2019s arrest, thousands of students converged near Istanbul city hall. Some waved Turkish flags; others held images of left-wing figures from the 1970s and sang a Turkish version of the Italian protest song \u201cBella ciao.\u201d In images on social media, some protesters made the ultranationalist \u201cgrey wolf\u201d hand sign, standing next to others showing the leftists\u2019 raised fist. Some showed the peace sign favored by both leftists and pro-Kurdish groups, while others chanted slogans attacking the banned militant Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party. Berk Esen, an associate professor of political science at Sabanci University, said most protesters he has seen are educated, urban young people aged 18 to 25, but they have little else in common: \u201cThis is a much more amorphous, eclectic group politically,\u201d he said. One afternoon last week, dozens of students from Bogazici University gathered at a metro station in Istanbul, many wearing masks to avoid reprisals or arrest. At the metro station, 22-year-old management student Burak Turan and his girlfriend slipped into a mall, watching officers detain dozens of protesters. \u201cWe are here because so many students are getting arrested for no reason,\u201d Turan said. \u201cThey act like it\u2019s a war; they are exercising wartime laws.\u201d Turan refused to wear a mask, saying he had nothing to be ashamed of. Other protesters include public employees, artists and retirees, many of whom support the CHP. A man in his 60s watching a standoff at city hall said he was there to defend the rights of the younger generation. \u201cWe don\u2019t matter, they do. They are our future.\u201d he said. Others were there to speak out against as what they perceived as a slide away from Turkiye\u2019s secular and democratic values under Erdogan. Mehtap Bozkurt, a 70-year-old pensioner and a CHP supporter, joined a protest outside Istanbul city hall. \u201cThis country is secular and will remain secular,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will resist until the end. I am ready to give my life and blood for this issue.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean that people protesting aren\u2019t practicing Muslims, said Esen, the Sabanci academic. \u201cThere are Muslims, religious people and those who at least perform some religious duties amongst the protesters,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they also probably define themselves as secular.\u201d Outside the courts in Istanbul, parents and relatives, some holding flowers, maintained an anxious vigil. Some hoped for a loved one\u2019s immediate release, while others were overcome with frustration. One family member, who asked to remain anonymous fearing reprisals from officials, told local media that the detained students had \u201cstudied day and night to get into the best universities.\u201d \u201cLook at the treatment they are receiving now. There are no rights. There is no law. There is no justice,\u201d she said. Another woman showed journalists a picture of her son with a black eye. \u201cHe told me, Mom, they beat me up,\u2019\u201d she said tearfully. Another woman said she was a cancer patient left waiting since dawn. \u201cWhat did these kids do? Did they murder someone? What did they even do?\u201d Around 300 protesters spent the Eid holiday in prison, separated from their families. Lawyers for several protesters told The Associated Press that students are held in overcrowded cells and face physical and verbal mistreatment, as well as limited access to meals since prison commissaries are closed for Eid. Lawyers also fear that students could miss exams or be expelled as a \u201cpunishment\u201d for taking part in the protests. Esen says the protests may mark a pivotal moment for Turkiye. \u201cWill the police violence used by the government against them make them throw in the towel after a certain point or will it bring about a bigger showdown and make this a long-term affair? If the latter happens, I will be very optimistic about Turkiye becoming democratic again. If the former happens, all of this is heading toward a very bad place,\u201d he said. A young female protester wearing a mask watched the standoff with police unfolding near city hall last week. \u201cI am here today because I do not accept autocracy,\u201d she said. \u201cEkrem Imamoglu\u2019s arrest means that we accept that there will be no more elections in this country. I do not accept this.\u201d OpinionIn the aftermath of Pahalgam, India must look at itself again"

            "text": "Pope Francis gestures as he appears for the first time since his return to the Vatican, in Saint Peter square, at the Vatican, April 6, 2025. (Reuters Photo) Pope Francis made his first public appearance since being discharged from hospital two weeks ago after treatment for double pneumonia, entering St. Peter\u2019s Square at the Vatican in a wheelchair on Sunday to greet cheering crowds. Francis, 88, had been out of public view since March 23, when he had given a short greeting before leaving Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital after more than five weeks of treatment in the most serious health crisis of his 12-year papacy. The pope, in a previously unannounced move, came out to the square shortly before noon (1000 GMT) at the end of the celebration of a Mass for the Catholic Church\u2019s Jubilee year. Coming in front of the main altar for the service in bright sunshine, Francis waved to the crowds, before speaking briefly. \u201cHappy Sunday to everyone,\u201d the pope said, speaking in a frail voice while receiving oxygen via a small hose under his nose. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d The pope smiled broadly as he greeted crowds. His voice, though weak, sounded stronger than it had during the March 23 appearance, when he struggled to speak. Francis usually offers a weekly noon-time prayer in St. Peter\u2019s Square on Sundays. But he has not been able to do this since February 9, before going to hospital. He was admitted to hospital on February 14 for a bout of bronchitis that developed into double pneumonia, an especially serious condition for him as he had pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed Francis came so close to death at one point during his 38-day stay in hospital that his doctors considered ending treatment so he could die in peace, the head of his medical team said last month. Sunday\u2019s Mass was part of a special celebration in honour of healthcare workers and those who are sick. In a written message released by the Vatican shortly after noon, <strong>Francis said he had felt God\u2019s closeness during his time in hospital. It is unclear how often the pope will appear in public in the coming weeks, with Easter Sunday just two weeks away. Doctors have prescribed Francis with a two-month period of rest at his Vatican residence, to allow his ageing body to heal, and the Vatican has removed all previous commitments from the pope\u2019s calendar. Britain\u2019s King Charles, who is coming to Italy next week for a state visit, has cancelled a planned meeting with Francis. The Vatican has not said yet whether the pope will be able to lead the celebrations on April 20 for Easter, the most important holiday of the Christian year."

(Express File Photo) Brazil\u2019s idea to create a new multilateral body under the UN climate regime to fast-track implementation of COP decisions has triggered cautious responses from key developed countries, with Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden backing reform discussions but warning against weakening the core UNFCCC process. Brazil, which will host this year\u2019s UN climate conference or COP30 in Belem, has informally proposed setting up a \u201cClimate Change Council\u201d under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to improve how the world responds to climate change. The idea is to speed up decision-making, coordinate efforts and improve implementation as many feel the current UN climate process is too slow and complicated. Climate impacts are worsening and global action is not keeping up. Many feel the UN climate talks are stuck in slow-moving negotiations with no real way to check if countries are doing enough. Experts say real progress may now require a complete rethink of the Paris Agreement and how climate diplomacy works. Part of a five-member delegation from EU countries that visited India last week, Germany\u2019s Deputy Special Envoy for International Climate Action Gerhard Schlaudraff told journalists that the idea was discussed at the Petersberg Climate Dialogue in Berlin in March. He welcomed Brazil\u2019s move to start the conversation but warned against undermining the UNFCCC or the Paris Agreement. \u201cThere is a general idea that the Brazilians put forward\u2026 but there\u2019s also the idea for everybody who was in the room that the UNFCCC is right now the best thing we have and we should not throw it away,\u201d Schlaudraff said. \u201cEvery year, the expectation is that the COPs will solve the climate crisis and that\u2019s not realistic,\u201d he said.

            "text": "French officials say Algiers is adopting a policy that aims to wipe France's economic presence from the country. (AP photos) France and Algeria resume diplomatic dialogue on Sunday after months of bickering that have hurt Paris\u2019 economic interests in its former colony, seen mutual accusations of humiliation and stalled vital security cooperation. Ties between Paris and Algiers have been complicated for decades, but took a turn for the worse last July when Macron angered Algeria by recognising a plan for autonomy for the Western Sahara region under Moroccan sovereignty. French officials say Algiers is adopting a policy that aims to wipe France\u2019s economic presence from the country, with trade falling by as much as 30% since the summer. A poor relationship has major security, economic and social repercussions: trade is extensive and some 10% of France\u2019s 68 million population has links to Algeria, according to French officials. \u201cIt is in the interest of France and the French people to be able to get results in terms of migration, judicial, security and economic cooperation,\u201d Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told lawmakers on April 1. Barrot arrives in Algiers on Sunday for a day of talks. That comes after a call between President Emmanuel Macron and his Algerian counterpart Abdelmadjid Tebboune on March 31, during which the two agreed to a broad roadmap to calm tensions. Also Read: | France accuses Algeria of refusing deported influencer to \u2018humiliate\u2019 Paris French officials say Algiers has put obstacles to administrative authorisations and new financing for French firms operating in the country. Nowhere has it been felt more than in wheat imports. Traders say the diplomatic rift led Algerian grains agency OAIC to tacitly exclude French wheat and firms in its import tenders since October. OAIC has said it treats all suppliers fairly, applying technical requirements. France has only shipped one wheat vessel to Algeria in the 2024/25 season, a single cargo of 30,000 tons wheat in July. That compares with several million tons annually in recent years. \u201cPeople are talking about it but they\u2019re waiting to see what impact this has on the ground,\u201d a French grain trader said of Barrot\u2019s trip. \u201cWe could definitely do with another buyer for our wheat.\u201d Beyond business, the relationship has also soured to the point where security cooperation, including over Islamist militancy, stopped. The detention by Algiers in November of 80-year-old Franco-Algerian author Boualem Sansal also worsened the relationship. He has since been sentenced to five years in prison. Paris hopes he will be given a presidential pardon, diplomats say. With Macron\u2019s government under pressure to toughen immigration policies, the spat has fed into domestic politics in both countries. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau has called for a 1968 pact between the two countries that makes it easier for Algerians to settle in France to be reviewed, after Algiers refused to take back some of its citizens who were ordered to leave France under the \u201cOQTF\u201d (obligation to leave French territory) deportation regime. The relationship between the two countries is scarred by the trauma of the 1954-1962 war in which the North African country, which had a large settler population and was treated as an integral part of France under colonial rule, won independence. Macron has over the years pushed for more transparency regarding France\u2019s past with Algeria while also saying that Algeria\u2019s \u201cpolitico-military system\u201d had rewritten the history of its colonisation by France based on \u201ca hatred of France\u201d. \u201cPresident Macron recognised the Moroccan character of Western Sahara, a move Algeria views as a betrayal. With no sign Macron will ever reverse this decision, the Algerians will not be making it easy for French firms to do new business in their country,\u201d said Jalel Harchaoui, associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute.

(Photo: Lexington Herald-Leader via AP) Another round of torrential rain and flash flooding came Saturday for parts of the South and Midwest already heavily waterlogged by days of severe storms that also spawned deadly tornadoes. Forecasters warned that rivers in some places would continue to rise for days. Day after day of heavy rains have pounded the central US, rapidly swelling waterways and prompting a series of flash flood emergencies in from Texas to Ohio. The National Weather Service said dozens of locations in multiple states were expected to reach major flood stage, with extensive flooding of structures, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure possible. At least 16 people weather-related deaths have been reported since the start of the storms, including 10 in Tennessee. A 57-year-old man died Friday evening after getting out of a car that washed off a road in West Plains, Missouri. Flooding killed two people in Kentucky \u2014 a 9-year-old boy swept away that same day on his way to school, and a 74-year-old whose body was found Saturday inside a fully submerged vehicle in Nelson County, authorities said. Also Saturday a 5-year-old died at a home in Little Rock, Arkansas, in a weather-related incident, according to police. No details were immediately provided. Tornadoes earlier in the week destroyed entire neighborhoods and were responsible for at least seven of the deaths. And interstate commerce is affected \u2014 the extreme flooding across a corridor that includes the major cargo hubs in Louisville, Kentucky and Memphis could lead to shipping and supply chain delays, said Jonathan Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather. The outburst comes at a time when nearly half of NWS forecast offices have 20% vacancy rates after Trump administration job cuts \u2014 twice that of just a decade ago. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said Saturday that the Ohio River rose 5 feet (about 1.5 meters) in 24 hours and would continue to swell for days. \u201cWe expect this to be one of the top 10 flooding events in Louisville history,\u201d he said. Flash flood emergency and tornado warnings continued to be issued Saturday across Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee, with more heavy rains and damaging winds in the mix. Hundreds of Kentucky roads were impassable because of floodwaters, downed trees or mud and rock slides. In north-central Kentucky, emergency officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for Falmouth, a town of 2,000 people in a bend of the rising Licking River. The warnings were similar to catastrophic flooding nearly 30 years ago when the river reached a record 50 feet (15 meters), resulting in five deaths and 1,000 homes destroyed. In Photos: Polar vortex brings record-low temperatures, deadly flooding to US Since Wednesday more than a foot of rain (30.5 centimeters) has fallen in parts of Kentucky, and more than 8 inches (20 centimeters) in parts of Arkansas and Missouri, forecasters said Saturday. Forecasters attributed the violent weather to warm temperatures, an unstable atmosphere, strong wind shear and abundant moisture streaming from the Gulf. At least two reports of observed tornadoes were noted Friday evening in Missouri and Arkansas, according to the National Weather Service. One, near Blytheville, Arkansas, lofted debris at least 25,000 feet (7.6 kilometers) high, according to NWS meteorologist Chelly Amin. The state\u2019s emergency management office reported damage in 22 counties from tornadoes, wind, hail and flash flooding. In Dyersburg, Tennessee, dozens of people arrived Saturday at a storm shelter near a public school in the rain, clutching blankets, pillows and other necessities. Among them was George Manns, 77, who said he was in his apartment when he heard a tornado warning and decided to head to the shelter. Just days earlier the city was hit by a tornado that caused millions of dollars in damage."

            "text": "Jennifer Vasquez Sura, the wife of Kilmar Abrego Garcia of Maryland, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, speaks during a news conference at CASA's Multicultural Center in Hyattsville. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) The U.S. Justice Department told an appeals court Saturday that a judge did not have the authority to order the Trump administration to broker the return of a Maryland man who was mistakenly sent to a notorious El Salvador prison, and it suspended a government lawyer who admitted in court that the deportation was an error. The government\u2019s attorneys asked the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to pause a Friday ruling by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who ordered the administration to \u201cfacilitate and effectuate\u201d Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u2019s return to the U.S. by late Monday night. \u201cA judicial order that forces the Executive to engage with a foreign power in a certain way, let alone compel a certain action by a foreign sovereign, is constitutionally intolerable,\u201d they wrote. The appeals court asked Abrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers to respond to the government\u2019s filing by Sunday afternoon. Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Salvadoran national, was arrested in Maryland and deported last month despite an immigration judge\u2019s 2019 ruling that shielded him from deportation to El Salvador, where he faced likely persecution by local gangs. His mistaken deportation, described by the White House as an \u201cadministrative error,\u201d has outraged many and raised concerns about expelling noncitizens who were granted permission to be in the U.S. During a court hearing Friday at a federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland, Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni conceded to Xinis that Abrego Garcia should not have been removed from the U.S. or sent to El Salvador. Reuveni could not tell the judge upon what authority he was arrested in Maryland. But by Saturday, Reuveni had been placed on leave by the Justice Department, a department spokesperson confirmed. His name was not on Saturday\u2019s filing to the appeals court. \u201cAt my direction, every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States. Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences,\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. Xinis, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, ruled Friday that there was no legal basis for Abrego Garcia\u2019s detention and no legal justification for his removal to El Salvador, where he has been held in a prison that observers say is rife with human rights abuses. Abrego Garcia\u2019s attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said the government has done nothing to get his client back, even after admitting its errors. \u201cPlenty of tweets. Plenty of White House press conferences. But no actual steps taken with the government of El Salvador to make it right,\u201d he told the judge on Friday. The White House has cast Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 gang member and doubled down on that claim after Friday\u2019s hearing. Abrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys have countered that there is no evidence he was in MS-13. Abrego Garcia had a permit from DHS to legally work in the U.S., his attorney said. He served as a sheet metal apprentice and was pursuing his journeyman license. His wife is a U.S. citizen. Abreho Garcia fled El Salvador around 2011 because he and his family were facing threats by local gangs. In 2019, a U.S. immigration judge granted him protection from deportation to El Salvador. Government lawyers say they have no control over Abrego Garcia and no authority to arrange for his return \u2014 \u201cany more than they would have the power to follow a court order commanding them to \u2018effectuate\u2019 the end of the war in Ukraine, or a return of the hostages from Gaza.\u201d \u201cIt is an injunction to force a foreign sovereign to send back a foreign terrorist within three days\u2019 time. That is no way to run a government. And it has no basis in American law,\u201d they wrote."

(Photo: KP George official website) Fort Bend County judge K P George, a prominent Indian-American elected official, was arrested Friday on two felony counts of money laundering stemming from allegations of wire fraud and falsification of a campaign finance report. George, a Democrat who has served as county judge since 2018 and won re-election in 2022, was booked into the county jail around 3:30 pm and released after posting USD 20,000 for bail. The charges carry a maximum prison term of 10 years. According to court records and the Fort Bend County District Attorney\u2019s Office, George is accused of laundering between USD 30,000 and USD 150,000. Officials confirmed the new charges are unrelated to a separate 2023 indictment in which George and former chief of staff Taral Patel were accused of manufacturing fake racist attacks against George\u2019s 2022 campaign by creating fraudulent social media accounts. \u201cThese charges are unrelated to the pending misdemeanour,\u201d the DA\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cOur office remains committed to the integrity our public deserves and the ethics to which all prosecutors are sworn.\u201d In a statement Friday, George denied any wrongdoing and claimed the indictments were politically driven. \u201cI have full faith in the judicial system and will vigorously defend my innocence,\u201d\u201d he said, accusing the DA\u2019s office of \u201cimproper treatment\u201d. The arrest has intensified political pressure on George. Fort Bend County Treasurer Bill Rickert publicly called for his resignation, citing concern over \u201cfake racism scandals\u201d and now the money laundering charges. Former Precinct 4 Constable Trever Nehls, who challenged George in 2022, echoed the sentiment, saying, \u201cThis indictment is not surprising. I saw during the campaign how lies and hate were used to manipulate voters.\u201d The charges against George and Patel have drawn widespread attention, particularly in Fort Bend, one of Texas\u2019s fastest-growing and most demographically diverse counties. \u201cAn indictment like this, especially involving alleged financial misconduct, can severely erode public trust even before a trial,\u201d said Dr. Elena Martinez, a political analyst at the University of Houston. \u201cGiven Fort Bend\u2019s national profile, this case is likely to draw attention well beyond the county line.\u201d George\u2019s office announced Thursday \u2014 just a day before his arrest \u2014 that the annual State of the County address, originally scheduled for May 8, had been postponed until further notice. No reason was given at the time."

            "text": "A district court judge has awarded more than $6 million combined to four whistleblowers in their lawsuit against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton who were fired shortly after they reported him to the FBI. \u201cBy a preponderance of the evidence,\u201d Travis County Judge Catherine Mauzy says in her judgment, the plaintiffs proved liability, damages and attorney\u2019s fees in their complaint against the attorney general\u2019s office.\u201cBecause the Office of the Attorney General violated the Texas Whistleblower Act by firing and otherwise retaliating against the plaintiff for in good faith reporting violations of law by Ken Paxton and OAG, the court hereby renders judgment for plaintiffs,\u201d Mauzy states. The court found that the four Paxton aides were fired in retaliation for reporting allegations that he was using his office to accept bribes from an Austin real estate developer who employed a woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair. Paxton has denied accepting bribes or misusing his office to help Nate Paul, the real estate developer. The judgment also stated that the employees made their reports to law enforcement \u201cin good faith\u201d and that Paxton\u2019s office did not dispute any claims or damages in the lawsuit.\u201cIt should shock all Texans that their chief law enforcement officer, Ken Paxton, admitted to violating the law, but that is exactly what happened in this case,\u201d said Tom Nesbitt, an attorney for Blake Brickman, and TJ Turner, an attorney for David Maxwell, in a joint statement. In a statement to the media, Paxton called the ruling \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cnot based on the facts or the law.\u201d He also said that his office intends to appeal the ruling. Paxton was at the center of a federal investigation after eight employees reported his office to the FBI in 2020 for bribery allegations. He agreed to settle the lawsuit for $3.3 million that would be paid by the Legislature. However, the House rejected his request and conducted its own investigation and impeached Paxton in 2023. He was later acquitted in the Senate.In November, the Texas Supreme Court overturned a lower-court ruling that Paxton testify in the lawsuit. The U.S. Justice Department decided not to pursue its investigation into Paxton in the final weeks of the Biden administration, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations."

(Reuters) Russia\u2019s defence ministry said on Saturday Ukraine had increased its attacks on Russian energy infrastructure, hitting targets 14 times in the last 24 hours, despite a US-brokered moratorium, a charge Ukraine\u2019s military called \u201cfake\u201d and \u201cdisinformation\u201d. In a statement published on Telegram, the ministry said Ukraine \u201cmultiplied the number of unilateral attacks using drones and artillery shells on the energy infrastructure of Russian regions\u201d. It said the strikes had caused damage in Russia\u2019s Bryansk, Belgorod, Smolensk, Lipetsk and Voronezh regions, as well as the Ukrainian regions of Luhansk and Kherson, parts of which Russia controls. Reuters was unable to verify the reports of the strikes. In its own statement on Telegram, Ukraine\u2019s military said that the reports were fake, and that its forces were only striking military targets.

Russia and Ukraine agreed last month to a U.S. proposal for a 30-day moratorium on striking each other\u2019s energy infrastructure. Both sides have since repeatedly accused each other of violating the deal. Separately on Saturday, authorities in two Russian regions reported Ukrainian drone strikes on local industrial facilities. The governor of Russia\u2019s Volga river region of Mordovia said Ukrainian drones had struck an industrial facility. Media reports said it was an optical fibre factory in the region\u2019s capital, Saransk. The governor of Samara region, another Volga riverside province, said that a factory in the city of Chapaevsk had been attacked by Ukrainian drones. A source in Ukraine\u2019s SBU security service told Reuters that the target was a plant producing industrial explosives, and that the strike had caused multiple explosions and fires. On Friday, a Russian strike on the Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih killed at least 19 people, including nine children, local officials said.

            "text": "Firefighter cancer registry website went down Tuesday \u201cbecause there were no IT people left to staff the system,\u201d Niemeier-Walsh said. (File Photo) Government staffing cuts have gutted a small US health agency that aims to protect workers \u2014 drawing rebukes from firefighters, coal miners, medical equipment manufacturers and a range of others. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a Cincinnati-based agency that is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is losing about 850 of its approximately 1,000 employees, according to estimates from a union and affected employees. Among those ousted were its director, Dr. John Howard, who had been in the job through three previous presidential administrations. The layoffs are stalling \u2014 and perhaps ending \u2014 many programs, including a firefighter cancer registry and a lab that is key to certifying respirators for many industries. The cuts are \u201ca very pointed attack on workers in this country,\u201d said Micah Niemeier-Walsh, vice president of the union local representing NIOSH employees in Cincinnati. Unions that represent miners, nurses, flight attendants and other professions have criticized the cuts, saying it will slow the identification and prevention of workplace dangers. Rallies in Cincinnati and other cities drew not only fired CDC employees but also members of unions representing teachers, postal workers and bricklayers, Niemeier-Walsh said. NIOSH doctors review and certify that 9/11 first responders who developed chronic illnesses could qualify for care under the federal government\u2019s World Trade Center Health Program, noted Andrew Ansbro, president of a union that represents New York City firefighters.\u201cDismantling NIOSH dishonors the memory of our fallen brothers and sisters and abandons those still battling 9/11-related illnesses,\u201d Ansbro said in a statement. NIOSH investigators identified a new lung disease in workers at factories that made microwave popcorn, and helped assess what went wrong during the Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster. It was recently involved in the CDC\u2019s response to measles, advising on measures to stop spread within hospitals. For years, NIOSH owned an experimental mine in Pennsylvania and two years ago announced it was developing a replacement research facility near Mace, West Virginia, that would feature tunnels and other mine structures. Its research and recommendations have served as the foundation for Department of Labor rules for worker protection, including one issued last year for coal miners that cuts by half the permissible exposures to poisonous silica dust. Impact of deep staff cuts are unclear NIOSH was swept up in the massive upheaval at the US Department of Health and Human Services that includes about 10,000 layoffs, an anticipated reorganization and proposed budget cuts. Nonunionized NIOSH workers \u2014 mainly supervisors \u2014 were told to clean out their desks immediately. Bargaining unit employees got layoff notices, and were told their terminations would happen later this year.\u201cRight now we are trying to figure out chain of command,\u201d Niemeier-Walsh said. An HHS spokesman, Andrew Nixon, said what\u2019s left of NIOSH will be moved into a newly created agency to be called the Administration for a Healthy America. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said that 20% of the people laid off from federal health agencies might be reinstated as the agency tries to correct mistakes, but the department has not detailed which parts of NIOSH were reduced or eliminated, and which will remain open. What\u2019s known about the cuts made so far was pieced together by employees affected by the layoffs and the union that represents them. They say almost every NIOSH program faced steep cuts or outright elimination. A firefighter cancer registry website went down Tuesday \u201cbecause there were no IT people left to staff the system,\u201d Niemeier-Walsh said. And at least some of the hundreds of mice and rats at a NIOSH lab in Morgantown likely will have to be destroyed because the layoffs put an abrupt, mid-experiment end to inhalation research there, said Cathy Tinney-Zara, a public health analyst who is president of the union local representing employees there.\u201cMillion of dollars of research, decades of research, is going down the drain,\u201d Tinney-Zara said. Industry concerned about certification labSome of the outcry from unions and industry has centered on the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, a NIOSH office that tests and certifies fitted masks that protect workers from inhaling airborne dangers. (The N95 masks that became popular during the COVID-19 outbreak are named for a NIOSH standard.) Closing the lab gives a competitive advantage to companies in China and other countries that send products to the US without meeting the stringent quality standards that come with certification, said Eric Axel, executive director of the American Medical Manufacturers Association. \u201cThis decision effectively rewards foreign manufacturers who have not made the same investments in quality and safety while punishing American companies that have built their reputations on producing reliable, high-quality protective equipment,\u201d Axel said in a statement. The cuts are \u201creally devastating,\u201d said Rebecca Shelton, director of policy for the Appalachian Citizens\u2019 Law Center, a Kentucky-based organization that provides legal help to ill coal miners. \u201cHere in central Appalachia, everybody knows somebody with black lung disease,\u201d she said. It appears NIOSH programs for coal miners are being eliminated, raising questions about who will monitor for new cases and spot trends, Shelton said. NIOSH staff routinely visited mines and rural communities to offer free screenings and speak at public meetings about black lung disease and other workplace health issues. \u201cThese are not out-of-touch federal workers. They are very well connected\u201d with their communities, she said."

(AP Photo/Vahid Salemi) Iran\u2019s rial currency traded Saturday at a record low against the US dollar as the country returned to work after a long holiday, costing over 1 million rials for a single greenback as tensions between Tehran and Washington likely will push it even lower. The exchange rate had plunged to over 1 million rials during the Persian New Year, Nowruz, as currency shops closed and only informal trading took place on the streets, creating additional pressure on the market. But as traders resumed work Saturday, the rate fell even further to 1,043,000 to the dollar, signaling the new low appeared here to stay. On Ferdowsi Street in Iran\u2019s capital, Tehran, the heart of the country\u2019s money exchanges, some traders even switched off their electronic signs showing the going rate as uncertainty loomed over how much further the rial could drop. \u201cWe turn it off since we are not sure about the successive changes of the rate,\u201d said Reza Sharifi, who works at one exchange. Iran\u2019s economy has been severely affected by international sanctions, particularly after US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. At the time of the 2015 deal, which saw Iran drastically limit its enrichment and stockpiling of uranium in exchange for lifting of international sanctions, the rial traded at 32,000 to the dollar. After Trump returned to the White House for his second term in January, he restarted his so-called \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign targeting Tehran with sanctions. He again went after firms trading Iranian crude oil, including those selling at a discount in China. Trump meanwhile has written to Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, trying to jumpstart direct talks between Tehran and Washington. So far, Iran has maintained it is willing for indirect talks, but such discussions under the Biden administration failed to make headway. Meanwhile, Trump is continuing an intense airstrike campaign targeting the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, the last force in Tehran\u2019s self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d able to attack Israel after other militant groups were mauled by Israel during its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Mehdi Darabi, a market analyst, said he believed that foreign pressures in recent months caused \u201cexpectations for the possibility of a decrease in oil sales and more inflation, and it caused a higher rate for hard currencies,\u201d according to Tehran\u2019s Donay-e-Eqtesad economic newspaper. Economic upheavals have evaporated the public\u2019s savings, pushing average Iranians into holding onto hard currencies, gold, cars and other tangible wealth. Others pursue cryptocurrencies or fall into get-rich-quick schemes. Meanwhile, internal political pressure remains inflamed still over the mandatory hijab, or headscarf, with women still ignoring the law on the streets of Tehran. Rumors also persist over the government potentially increasing the cost of subsidized gasoline in the country, which has sparked nationwide protests in the past. The falling rial has put more pressure as well on Iranian reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian. In March, when the rate was 930,000 rials to the dollar, Iran\u2019s parliament impeached his finance minister, Abdolnasser Hemmati over the crashing rial and accusations of mismanagement. Anger over government spending also saw Pezeshkian fire his vice president in charge of parliamentary affairs, Shahram Dabiri, for taking a luxury cruise to Antarctica, state media reported. Though Dabiri reportedly used his own money for the trip with his wife, the Instagram photos posted of his trip angered an Iranian public scrapping by to survive. \u201cIn a situation where the economic pressures on people are huge and the number of deprived people is massive, expensive recreational trip by officials even by their own personal fund is not defendable and reasonable,\u201d Pezeshkian said in firing Dabiri, who so far hasn\u2019t offered any public explanation for his trip.

            "text": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, joined by Senators Klobuchar, Wyden, and Cortez Masto, addresses reporters ahead of a voting marathon on Trump\u2019s budget agenda at the Capitol. (AP photo) Senate Republicans plugged away overnight and into early Saturday morning to approve their multitrillion-dollar tax breaks and spending cuts framework, hurtling past hardened Democratic opposition toward what President Donald Trump calls the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d that\u2019s central to his agenda. The vote, 51-48, fell along mostly party lines, but with sharp dissent from two prominent GOP senators. It could not have come at a more difficult political moment. The US economy is churning after Trump\u2019s vast tariff scheme sent stocks plummeting, and experts are warning of soaring costs for consumers at home and threats of a potential recession. Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky both voted against. But with a nod from Trump, GOP leaders held on, determined to march ahead. Approval paves the way for Republicans, in the months ahead, to try to power a tax cut bill through both chambers of Congress over the objections of Democrats, just as they did in Trump\u2019s first term with unified party control in Washington.

Among them were proposals to ban tax breaks for the super-wealthy, end Trump\u2019s tariffs, clip his efforts to shrink the federal government and protect Medicaid, Social Security and other services. One, in response to the Trump national security team\u2019s use of Signal, sought to prohibit military officials from using any commercial messaging application to transmit war plans. They all failed, though a GOP amendment to protect Medicare and Medicaid was accepted. Democrats accused Republicans of laying the groundwork for cutting key safety net programs to help pay for more than $5 trillion tax cuts they say disproportionately benefit the rich. \u201cTrump\u2019s policies are a disaster,\u201d said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, as is Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency. \u201cRepublicans could snuff it out tonight, if they wanted.\u201d The Republicans framed their work as preventing a tax increase for most American families, arguing that unless Congress acts, the individual and estate tax cuts that Republicans passed in 2017 will expire at the end of this year. The Senate package pulls in other GOP priorities \u2014 including $175 billion to bolster Trump\u2019s mass deportation effort, which is running short of cash, and another $175 billion for the Pentagon to build up the military \u2014 from an earlier budget effort. Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 ranking GOP senator, said voters gave Republicans a mission in November, and the Senate budget plan delivers. \u201cIt fulfills our promises to secure the border, to rebuild our economy and to restore peace through strength,\u201d Barrasso said. The framework now goes to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., could bring it up for a vote as soon as next week as he works toward a final product by Memorial Day. Also Read: | How did the US calculate reciprocal tariffs? Not how Trump said it would The House and Senate need to resolve their differences. The House Republicans had already approved their version, with $4.5 trillion in tax breaks over 10 years and some $2 trillion in budget cuts pointed at changes to Medicaid, food stamps and other programs, and some have panned the Senate\u2019s approach. Collins said she voted against the full package because potential Medicaid cuts in the underlying House bill \u201cwould be very detrimental to a lot of families and disabled individuals and seniors in my state.\u201d One Republican, Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, expressed his own misgivings about tax breaks adding to the federal deficits and said he has assurances that Trump officials would seek the cuts elsewhere. \u201cThis vote isn\u2019t taking place in a vacuum,\u201d he said, a nod to the turmoil over Trump\u2019s tariffs. One crucial challenge ahead will be for the House to accept the way the Senate\u2019s budget plan allows for extending the tax cuts under a scoring method that treats them as not adding to future deficits, something many House Republicans reject. A new estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation projects the tax breaks will add $5.5 trillion over the next decade when including interest, and $4.6 trillion not including interest. Also Read: | Daily Briefing: The good, bad and ugly of Trump\u2019s tariffs On top of that, the senators added an additional $1.5 trillion that would allow some of Trump\u2019s campaign promises, such as no taxes on tips, Social Security benefits and overtime, swelling the overall the price tag to $7 trillion. Republicans are also looking to increase the $10,000 deduction for state and local taxes, something that lawmakers from states such as New York, California and New Jersey say is necessary for their support. The House and Senate are also at odds over increasing the debt limit to allow more borrowing. The House had boosted the debt limit by $4 trillion in its plan, but the Senate upped it to $5 trillion to push any further votes on the matter until after next year\u2019s midterm elections. The Senate calls for just $4 billion in spending cuts, but GOP leadership emphasizes that\u2019s a low floor and that committees will be on the hunt for far more. Already, the GOP leaders are confronting concerns from fiscal hawks in deep red states and congressional districts who want trillions of dollars in spending cuts to help pay for the tax breaks. The GOP leadership has encouraged members to just get a budget plan over the finish line, saying they have time to work out the tough questions of which tax breaks and spending cuts to include. Extending the 2017 breaks would cut taxes for about three-quarters of households but raise them for about 10%. In 2027, about 45% of the benefit of all the tax cuts would go to those making roughly $450,000 or more, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, which analyzes tax issues.

These are the same individuals, former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships,\u201d Combs\u2019 legal team said in a statement. \u201cThis was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion.\u201d Friday\u2019s superseding indictment is the third filed against Combs. In the first, in January, federal prosecutors disclosed that their case involved at least three women whom they said Combs forced to engage in commercial sex acts. They also alleged Combs showed a firearm to a female victim during a kidnapping and once dangled a woman over an apartment balcony. Combs\u2019 January indictment didn\u2019t include additional charges but modified some details of the existing ones, including adding four years to the alleged racketeering conspiracy. Prosecutors now say it started in 2004, not 2008 as the original indictment had alleged. A superseding indictment in March contained minimal changes. Combs has pleaded not guilty to the first set of charges, which allege that he coerced and abused women for years with help from a network of associates and employees while silencing victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings.

The accuser referred to as \u201cVictim-1\u201d in Combs\u2019 charging documents is prepared to testify under her own name, prosecutors said in the filing, which was heavily redacted.

Prosecutors contend the assault happened during a \u201cFreak Off.\u201d Combs lawyers argue the footage was nothing more than a \u201cglimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\u201d between the two.

            "text": "Growing focus on humanitarian aid after massive Earthquake in Myanmar on March 28. (Source: File photo) Search teams in Myanmar recovered more bodies from the ruins of buildings on Friday, a week after a massive earthquake killed more than 3,100 people, as the focus turns toward the urgent humanitarian needs in a country already devastated by a continuing civil war. United Nations humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher, who is also the emergency relief coordinator, will visit the area on Friday in an effort to spur action following the March 28 quake. Ahead of the visit, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealed to the international community to immediately step up funding for quake victims \u201cto match the scale of this crisis,\u201d and he urged unimpeded access to reach those in need. \u201cThe earthquake has supercharged the suffering with the monsoon season just around the corner,\u201d he said. Myanmar\u2019s military and several key armed resistance groups have all declared ceasefires in the wake of the earthquake to facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid. But the UN\u2019s Human Rights Office on Friday accused the military of continuing attacks, claiming there were more than 60 attacks after the earthquake, including 16 since the military announced a temporary ceasefire on Wednesday. \u201cI urge a halt to all military operations, and for the focus to be on assisting those impacted by the quake, as well as ensuring unhindered access to humanitarian organizations that are ready to support,\u201d said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said. \u201cI hope this terrible tragedy can be a turning point for the country towards an inclusive political solution.\u201d Announcing its ceasefire, the military also said it would still take \u201cnecessary\u201d measures against resistance groups, if they use the ceasefire to regroup, train or launch attacks, and the groups have said they reserved the right to defend themselves. Myanmar\u2019s military seized power in 2021 from the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking what has turned into a civil war.

The quake worsened an already dire humanitarian crisis, with more than 3 million people displaced from their homes and nearly 20 million in need even before it hit, according to the United Nations. Myanmar authorities said Thursday that 3,145 people had been killed in the earthquake, with another 4,589 people injured and 221 missing, and did not immediately update the figures on Friday. Britain, which had already given USD 13 million to purchase emergency items like food, water and shelter, pledged an additional USD 6.5 million in funds to match an appeal from Myanmar\u2019s Disasters Emergency Committee, according to the UK Embassy in Yangon. The World Food Programme said so far it has reached 24,000 survivors, but was scaling up its efforts to assist 8,50,000 with food and cash assistance for one month. Many international search and rescue teams are now on the scene, and eight medical crews from China, Thailand, Japan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Philippines, Indonesia and Russia were operating in Naypyitaw, according to Myanmar\u2019s military-run government. Another five teams from India, Russia, Laos and Nepal and Singapore were helping in the Mandalay region, while teams from Russia, Malaysia and the ASEAN bloc of nations were assisting in the Sagaing region. On Friday, five bodies were recovered from the rubble in the capital Naypyitaw and the second-largest city of Mandalay, near the epicentre of the 7.7 magnitude earthquake March 28, authorities said. The last reported rescue came Wednesday, some 125 hours after the quake struck, when a man was saved from the wreckage of a hotel in Mandalay.

            "text": "Vilvaraj Vinothan, 30, works with the Mine Advisory Group to find and remove unexploded explosive devices in a mined area of Mankulam, Sri Lanka. (AP photo) Thavarathnam Pushparani fought on the front lines for the now-defeated Tamil Tiger rebels against the Sri Lankan forces in its decadeslong separatist war and later took to clearing the land mines on the same battle lines. But the Trump administration\u2019s suspension of aid threatens Sri Lanka\u2019s demining operations, pushing the livelihoods of thousands like Pushparani into uncertainty. What is more uncertain for Sri Lanka now is its obligation to rid the island nation of mines by 2028 under the Ottawa Treaty, which it ratified in 2017. Demining operations in Sri Lanka started in 2002 during a ceasefire period and the US has been the major donor among 11 countries supporting the effort, contributing about 34% of the $250 million grants received for the projects so far. The US contribution was 45% of the grants received last year, according to M.M Nayeemudeen, director of the state-run National Mine Action Centre. Thanks to international generosity, the demining operations continue to date despite being interrupted for a few years because of the breakdown of the ceasefire. They have so far managed to clear more than 2.5 million anti-personnel, anti-tank, small arms ammunition and unexploded ordnance. Out of 254 square kilometers of land that originally needed to be cleared, only about 23 square kilometers are left to deal with. Whether that can be achieved by the 2028 deadline will depend on continued funding. Nayeemudeen said once the aid suspension was announced, Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign ministry appealed and the US allowed the usage of its allocated funds pending a review, a decision on which is expected on May 1. \u201cWe hope that on completion of the 90-day review period that commenced from January 24, 2025, the US government funding assistance will continue,\u201d said Ananda Chandrasiri, head of Delvon Assistance for Social Harmony, one of the four demining groups operating in the country. \u201cOtherwise it will create a grave problem for Sri Lanka to achieve mine-free status by the end of 2027 as targeted \u2026 A huge reduction of staffing levels of the four operators would be inevitable.\u201d There are around 3,000 workers, most of them recruited from among the civil war-affected communities. With the uncertainty, some groups have already started terminating their staff, Nayeemudeen said. Sri Lanka\u2019s civil war ended in 2009 when government troops crushed the Tamil Tiger rebels, ending their quarter-century separatist campaign. According to conservative UN estimates, about 100,000 people were killed in the conflict. Kumarakulasingham Dinojan has lost his left hand below his wrist and has damaged fingers in his right hand from a mine blast. As a 9-year-old boy, he tried to open a metal container that he found in the woods. His brother, who was playing with him, also suffered wounds. \u201cMy grandmother went into the woods to get firewood and we also followed her. We did not know that she had reached home through another way. We found a container which looked like a perfumed powder, and when we tried to open it, it exploded,\u201d said Dinojan. There were people who were injured or killed trying to open mines and use the explosives for fishing. Dinojan\u2019s older brother, Vilvaraj Vinothan, said his brothers becoming land mine victims made him take action and become involved in mine clearance. He has worked with the Mine Advisory Group for six years. \u201cOnly when the land was being cleared that I understood how we should deal with the mines,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I decided to help, knowing it would benefit the entire community.\u201d Pushparani is grateful that her demining income has allowed her to fulfill her family\u2019s needs. She financed one daughter\u2019s university education and her marriage. However, she also cares for a daughter injured in crossfire and an elderly mother. \u201cThe reason for my choosing demining for livelihood is not only because of poverty. I also have a desire to see this land to be free of mines,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see our future generations being injured or affected by war. I can say that I am carrying the burden of both my family and of the country on my shoulders.\u201d Trending\u2018Disgusting\u2019: Miss World 2025 contestants' feet washed by Telangana women, viral video sparks debate SportsAsian Games 2026: With athletes staying on cruise ship, plans afoot to brace for tsunami, typhoons OpinionIn the aftermath of Pahalgam, India must look at itself again How Op Sindoor demonstrates capabilities of Made in India defence SportsAsian Games 2026: With athletes staying on cruise ship, plans afoot to brace for tsunami, typhoons Trending\u2018Disgusting\u2019: Miss World 2025 contestants' feet washed by Telangana women, viral video sparks debate Oil India announces hydrocarbon exploration breakthrough in Tripura with Debtamura 1 well"

(AP representational photo) The US Senate on Wednesday passed legislation that would terminate new tariffs on Canada, just hours after President Donald Trump unveiled a raft of duties on foreign goods against countries spanning the globe. The Senate voted 51-48 to approve the bill and send it to the House of Representatives, where it is likely to be shelved. In a blow to Trump, four Senate Republicans teamed up with Democrats to advance the legislation. The Democratic-sponsored bill would terminate a national emergency Trump declared on January 22, which he linked to illegal imports of the deadly fentanyl drug from Mexico, Canada and China and used to target Canada with steep new tariffs. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican, had urged defeat of the bill, arguing that shifting attention away from Canada would be \u201ca step backward.\u201d The measure needed at least four Republican votes to pass in the chamber where Trump\u2019s party holds a 53-47 majority.

An FBI probe in October 2023 linked him to a social media account used to exploit minor girls. (Representational file photo) A 31-year-old Indian national has been sentenced to 35 years in prison for sexually exploiting several children through a social media app where he often posed as a teenage boy to gain their trust and threatened and extorted them with child pornography when they refused his requests. Sai Kumar Kurremula, 31, an Indian national living in Edmond, Oklahoma on an immigrant visa, has been sentenced to serve 420 months in federal prison for the sexual exploitation of three children and transportation of child pornography, US Attorney Robert Troester said in a statement. At the sentencing hearing last week, US District Judge Charles Goodwin sentenced Kurremula to serve 420 months in federal prison, followed by a lifetime term of supervised release. In announcing his sentence, Goodwin noted that these offences are among those that society considers the most serious because they involve such vulnerable victims. Goodwin further highlighted that Kurremula inflicted trauma on his victims that will echo throughout their lives and their families\u2019 lives, and his lengthy sentence of imprisonment reflects that trauma.

According to an affidavit filed in support of a criminal complaint, in October 2023, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began investigating an account on a social media messaging app involving a user who was sexually exploiting minor girls. The Internet Protocol address used to create the account led federal authorities to Kurremula. Public documents and evidence at the sentencing hearing allege Kurremula had sexually exploited at least 19 minors through the social media messaging app, often posing as a 13-15-year-old boy to gain the trust of his victims. When the victims refused his requests, Kurremula would manipulate, threaten, and extort his victims to produce even more child pornography. Kurremula had pleaded guilty and admitted to sexually exploiting three minor victims and knowingly transporting images of child pornography. Specifically, Kurremula admitted that to ensure the minor victims complied, he threatened one minor that he would drive to her house and show her parents sexually explicit images of her; threatened another victim that he would come to her home and shoot her family; and threatened a third young individual that he would publicly post sexually explicit images and videos of her.

(Kim Do-hun/Yonhap via AP) South Korea\u2019s interim leader called on the nation on Wednesday to calmly accept the decision from the Constitutional Court on the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol, as police ramped up security around the court ahead of the ruling on April 4. At a ministerial meeting on safety ahead of the historic ruling, acting President Han Duck-soo said he \u201cstrongly asked\u201d politicians not to make any comments that could incite violence. \u201cThe government will not tolerate any illegal or violent acts. No matter what decision is made, we must accept the results calmly based on the rule of law,\u201d Han said. \u201cIf we can become one again with your strength and wisdom, we can overcome this crisis of confusion and conflicts,\u201d he said. The Constitutional Court, which is reviewing Yoon\u2019s impeachment over the shock martial law order, said it will announce its decision on whether to remove him from office permanently or reinstate him on Friday, April 4. Yoon was impeached by parliament on December 14 after being accused of violating his constitutional duty by declaring martial law in early December with no justifiable grounds. Protesters march during a rally demanding the immediate indictment of impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in Seoul, South Korea. (Photo: AP/ PTI) If the court rules to oust him, a new presidential election must be held within 60 days. South Korean police have beefed up security in areas around the court, preparing to deploy all forces from midnight into the ruling day on Friday. The acting chief for the national police force, Lee Ho-young, said the area around the court would be turned into a \u201cvacuum state\u201d to restrict access and cordon off pro-and anti-Yoon rallies to prevent any potential clashes. Vowing to act sternly against any violence, Lee said police will arrest those who vandalise facilities, threaten justices or assault police officers.

Cho was the second acting president and had angered opposition parties that have a commanding majority in parliament by repeatedly vetoing bills and not appointing a Constitutional justice approved by the assembly. The opposition parties are however likely to hold off voting on Choi\u2019s impeachment bill before Yoon\u2019s ruling. Bracing for big rallies and a heavy police presence on the ruling day, foreign embassies have issued alerts calling for extra caution.

(Source: Reuters) For most of the day, somberness clouded over a makeshift shelter set up for grief-stricken relatives of dozens of workers who remain missing at the building collapse in Bangkok. They huddled together, a short distance from the rubble, awaiting news for their loved ones to be found. But for a few minutes, their faces broke out in smiles, as a group of fluffy, playful golden retrievers approached the waiting relatives on a break from the dogs\u2019 rescue mission.

            "text": "These two groups, which make up 70% of the student population in the district, have historically faced systemic educational disadvantages. (Representational image/ AP) In a groundbreaking development for the Indian edtech sector, an instant tutoring platform built in India is transforming education outcomes in the United States. A recent study conducted by Johns Hopkins University has confirmed that Filo, an instant 1-on-1 tutoring platform, is driving measurable academic improvements among underserved students in Jefferson County Public Schools, Birmingham, Alabama. The study highlights a significant boost in academic performance among students who used Filo\u2019s instant tutoring service. Male students enrolled in the program outperformed their peers by 14 points, while African American students saw an 11-point improvement. By providing round-the-clock, on-demand tutoring, Filo is effectively bridging learning gaps and reinforcing the importance of personalized education. This impact is particularly significant as it aligns with the core principles of India\u2019s National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which emphasizes competency-based, flexible, and personalized learning. Filo\u2019s success in Alabama validates India\u2019s growing influence in global education policy and innovation. The platform\u2019s real-time tutoring model has already transformed learning outcomes for millions of students in rural India by instantly matching them using AI with the right tutors. Now, its effectiveness in the U.S. signals a paradigm shift\u2014one where Indian education technology is setting global benchmarks. The study from Johns Hopkins, along with statistical reports from other impact studies, validates Filo as one of the very few platforms demonstrating measurable learning gains across multiple education systems. This positions India as a thought leader in education technology and policy. Filo\u2019s patented instant tutoring platform connects students with expert tutors in real time, offering personalized academic support at any hour of the day. This innovative model ensures that students, regardless of location or economic background, receive quality education tailored to their needs. Speaking on the study\u2019s findings, Rohit Kumar, Co-founder of Filo, emphasized the significance of this milestone: \u201cThis study reaffirms what we at Filo have always believed\u2014instant, personalized learning has the power to transform education at scale. Seeing an Indian-built solution drive measurable impact in US classrooms is not just a milestone for us, but for the future of global education. This is a testament to the power of technology in breaking learning barriers, and we\u2019re just getting started.\u201d The success of Filo not only highlights the potential of real-time tutoring powered by AI but also strengthens India\u2019s role in shaping international education policies. With NEP 2020 serving as the guiding framework, Indian edtech companies are now demonstrating how scalable, adaptive learning models can be implemented effectively worldwide. \u201cThe National Education Policy (NEP 2020) has been the guiding light in shaping Filo\u2019s approach to leveraging technology for personalized, just-in-time peer tutoring. By aligning with its vision, we have been able to drive meaningful learning outcomes across India, Middle East, and USA, making high-quality education more accessible and effective globally,\u201d said Shashank Singhal, Director of Filo.

(AP/ PTI Photo) A federal judge on Tuesday said the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump cannot quickly fire thousands of probationary federal workers in 19 states and Washington, D.C., narrowing an earlier nationwide ruling. U.S. District Judge James Bredar in Baltimore, Maryland, said that if federal agencies want to fire large numbers of probationary workers, they must follow the required procedures for conducting mass layoffs of government employees. The administration failed to do so when it terminated about 24,500 people in February without notifying states and local governments in advance, he said. But Bredar said he only had the power to require the reinstatement of employees who either live or work in the mostly Democratic-led states that, along with Washington, D.C., sued over the mass firings. Probationary employees typically have less than a year of service in their current roles, though some are longtime federal employees. Bredar on March 13 had already ruled that the firings were likely illegal and ordered 18 agencies to reinstate workers who had been fired pending further litigation. Tuesday\u2019s decision will be in place pending the outcome of the lawsuit, which could take months or longer to resolve. The Trump administration has appealed Bredar\u2019s earlier decision, claiming the firings were lawful and the judge lacked the power to require workers to be reinstated. A U.S. appeals court panel earlier in March declined to pause his ruling, but a Trump-appointed judge criticized the nationwide scope of the order."

(File Photo) South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court will rule Friday on whether to formally dismiss or reinstate impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol \u2014 a decision that either way will likely deepen domestic divisions. The court has been deliberating Yoon\u2019s political fate after he was impeached in December over his brief imposition of martial law that has triggered a massive political crisis. Millions of people have rallied around the country to support or denounce Yoon. Police said they\u2019ll mobilize all available personnel to preserve order and respond to acts of vandalism, arson and assault. The Constitutional Court said in a brief statement Tuesday that it would issue its ruling at 11 a.m. Friday and that it will be broadcast live. The opposition-controlled liberal National Assembly voted to impeach Yoon about two weeks after he imposed martial law Dec. 3. In addition to the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling on his impeachment, Yoon was arrested and indicted in January on criminal rebellion charges. If the Constitutional Court removes Yoon from office, South Korea must hold an election within two months for a new president. If the court overturns his impeachment, Yoon would immediately return to his presidential duties. Also Read | South Korean court reinstates PM Han as acting leader; decision on President Yoon\u2019s impeachment pending At the heart of the matter is Yoon\u2019s decision to send hundreds of troops and police officers to the National Assembly after imposing martial law. Yoon has insisted that he aimed to maintain order, but some military and military officials testified Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to frustrate a floor vote on his decree and detain his political opponents. Yoon argues that he didn\u2019t intend to maintain martial law for long, and he only wanted to highlight what he called the \u201cwickedness\u201d of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which obstructed his agenda, impeached senior officials and slashed his budget bill. During his martial law announcement, he called the assembly \u201ca den of criminals\u201d and \u201canti-state forces.\u201d By law, a president has the right to declare martial law in wartime or other emergency situations, but the Democratic Party and its supporters say South Korea wasn\u2019t in such a situation. The impeachment motion accused Yoon of suppressing National Assembly activities, attempting to detain politicians and others and undermining peace in violation of the constitution and other laws. Yoon has said he had no intention of disrupting National Assembly operations and detaining anyone. Earlier public surveys showed a majority of South Koreans supported Yoon\u2019s impeachment. But after his impeachment, pro-Yoon rallies have grown sharply, with many conservatives fed up with what they call the Democratic Party\u2019s excessive offensive on the already embattled Yoon administration. Yoon was released from prison March 8, after a Seoul district court cancelled his arrest and allowed him to stand his criminal trial without being detained. Ten top military and police officials have also been arrested and indicted over their roles in the martial law enactment."

The airstrike came without warning days after Israel launched an attack on the Lebanese capital, Beirut, on Friday for the first time since a ceasefire ended fighting between Israeli forces and the Hezbollah militant group in November. The Israeli military then had warned residents in the crowded suburbs before the attack after two projectiles were launched from southern Lebanon, which Hezbollah denied firing. At least seven other people were wounded in Tuesday\u2019s airstrike, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.

Israel has launched daily strikes in southern and eastern Lebanon since the U.S.-brokered ceasefire went into effect, saying it targets Hezbollah officials and infrastructure. The Lebanese military has gradually deployed in the country\u2019s southern region, and Beirut has urged the international community to pressure Israel to stop attacks and withdraw its forces still present on five hilltops in Lebanese territory.

            "title": "How a new Georgia bill could change fate of domestic abuse survivors in prison",
            "text": "The Georgia Capitol is shown on Tuesday in Atlanta. (AP Photo/Jeff Amy, File) Mary Favors is still plagued by nightmares from the days her husband beat her, choked her and verbally and sexually abused her. Now, she is in prison for killing him. Between 74% and 95% of incarcerated women have survived domestic abuse or sexual violence, according to the Georgia Coalition Against Domestic Violence. Many were tried without fair opportunities to prove the scope of the abuse and how it led them to act in self-defense, while others were coerced into crimes, according to advocates, who add that certain laws disproportionately criminalize abused women. At other times, they say, people simply don\u2019t believe women\u2019s stories, with women of color like Favors who survive abuse especially likely to end up in prison. But under the Georgia Survivor Justice Act, which passed the state House overwhelmingly with bipartisan support and awaits Senate consideration, abuse survivors could secure early release from prison. The bill calls for judges to resentence those who are incarcerated and impose shorter sentences on those who are convicted if they can tie their crimes to domestic abuse. It also would expand what can be presented as supporting evidence. It\u2019s all part of a broader move toward reform that has gained momentum nationwide as states including Missouri, Connecticut and Massachusetts consider similar legislation. Some states already have passed laws intended to reduce sentences for victims of abuse who face charges or were convicted. She received the maximum of 20 years in prison for the killing and five years of probation for having the knife. Many incarcerated survivors are serving life sentences. \u201cThere\u2019s this blurring of the lines between victim and suspect when girls and women are criminalized for the sexual violence that they experience,\u201d said Rebecca Epstein, executive director of the Center on Gender Justice and Opportunity at Georgetown Law. After her husband\u2019s death, Favors transported the body and left it elsewhere. Research shows similar snap decisions by victims in response to trauma can taint how jurors, judges and prosecutors see defendants, said Leigh Goodmark, a University of Maryland law professor who studies the criminalization of domestic violence. Goodmark hopes efforts like Georgia\u2019s will help judges and prosecutors \u201csee that victimization is much more complicated than they want it to be.\u201d Current Georgia law is strict about how lawyers can bring in evidence of domestic abuse, said Ellie Williams, legal director with the Georgia Coalition Against Domestic Violence. She is spearheading the legislation, which would loosen some restrictions, and said the strict guidelines reflect outdated understandings of abuse. Under Georgia\u2019s bill, if a judge determines family violence, dating violence or child abuse contributed to a crime with a minimum sentence of life in prison, the judge, in most cases, would have to impose a sentence of 10 to 30 years in prison. For other felonies, judges would not be able to sentence the defendant to more than half of the maximum sentence they could have otherwise gotten. People in prison could also request resentencing under the rules if the act ultimately becomes law. Georgia\u2019s bill would also make it easier for courts to consider domestic violence in cases involving self-defense or victims being coerced into committing a crime, which is common. The bill is \u201cnot a get out of jail free card,\u201d said bill sponsor Rep. Stan Gunter, a Republican. Randy McGinley, district attorney for the Alcovy Judicial Circuit, said during a committee hearing that families may become upset if the person who killed their loved one walks free from prison early. New York passed a bill in 2019 that allowed judges and prosecutors to revisit sentences. The Survivors Justice Project said at least 71 people have received a reduction and 85 applications were denied. California has a similar law. Illinois last year passed a law expanding eligibility for resentencing building on previous laws. The Oklahoma Survivors\u2019 Act, passed last year, shortens sentences for crimes driven by domestic violence. A few have gone home. But a bill failed this year that could have provided some sentencing relief for women who were convicted under Oklahoma\u2019s \u201cfailure to protect\u201d law for not protecting children from their abusers. They often receive sentences equal to or more than their abusers. Now drug-free, Favors dreams of working at a battered women\u2019s shelter. In prison, she earned her high school diploma and took classes about abuse. To heal, she prays, fasts, reads her Bible and meets with others in a prison ministry, sharing what God did for them. \u201cI survived from my abuse,\u201d Favors answers. \u201cI could have been the one that was dead.\u201d"

(AP Representational Photo) US President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is terminating grants for two clean energy projects, and roughly 300 others funded by the Department of Energy are in jeopardy as the president prioritizes fossil fuels. The DOE is cancelling two awards to a nonprofit clean energy think tank, RMI in Colorado, according to a document from the agency confirming the cancellations that was reviewed by The Associated Press on Friday. One was for nearly $5.3 million to retrofit low-income multifamily buildings in Massachusetts and California to demonstrate ways to reduce the use of energy and lower planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. The other was for $1.5 million to assess business models for electric vehicle carsharing in US cities. The department wrote that it had determined the awards do not meet the administration\u2019s objectives. Both awards are on a list of about 300 clean energy projects under review. President Donald Trump declared an energy emergency early in his term and is working to speed up fossil fuel development, which he sums up as \u201cdrill, baby, drill.\u201d The burning of oil, gas, and coal is the main contributor to global warming caused by human activity. President Joe Biden tried to lock in a trajectory for reducing the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.

As of Friday afternoon, she said she hadn\u2019t seen a second letter, but the retrofitting work is due to finish in June using a grant announced during Trump\u2019s first term. The Department of Energy said in a statement late Friday that the department \u201cacted in the best interest of the American people\u201d by terminating the grants. As for other grants on the list, the statement said, the department is still conducting a wide-ranging review. E&E News first reported last week that the DOE was creating a \u201chit list\u201d of clean energy projects awarded billions of dollars that the Trump administration could wipe out. The list, obtained by the AP, includes wind, solar, battery storage, and electric vehicle infrastructure projects. It includes funding to help heavy industries transition away from fossil fuels and funding to decarbonize buildings. Many projects were funded through the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law Biden signed in 2021. Separately, the Environmental Protection Agency terminated grant agreements this month worth $20 billion issued by the Biden administration under a so-called green bank to finance clean energy and climate-friendly projects. A federal judge has blocked the administration from ending the grant program for now. Also Read: | Why Donald Trump\u2019s Paris Agreement pullout could have worse consequences than in 2017 US Rep.

RMI has received government contracts and grants under Republican and Democratic administrations since its founding in 1982. Cappiello said that money has been used to help advance secure, reliable, efficient, and clean energy solutions.

The actions have been condemned as an assault on free speech, though the Trump administration argues that certain protests are antisemitic and can undermine U.S. foreign policy."

            "text": "Myanmar's junta chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who ousted the elected government in a coup, presides at an army parade on Armed Forces Day in Naypyitaw, Myanmar. REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo The chief of Myanmar\u2019s ruling junta vowed on Thursday to hold a free and fair election in December, as he urged armed opponents in a widening civil war to renounce violence and pursue dialogue. Min Aung Hlaing during a speech at the country\u2019s annual armed forces day parade said the military was seeking to hold a \u201cdignified\u201d election and promised to transfer power to the winning party. He told hundreds of soldiers assembled at the sprawling parade ground in the capital Naypyitaw that they must support a free and fair, multi-party vote. \u201cThe necessary preparations are underway for the election,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are working on to hold the election people desire, which is a free and fair and multi-party democratic election.\u201d \u201cWe will transfer power to the wining party,\u201d he added. Despite being locked in a civil war, the economy in tatters and dozens of political parties banned or refusing to take part, the military is determined to forge ahead with an election, which critics have derided as a sham to keep the generals in power through proxies. Since overthrowing the elected civilian government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021, the military has struggled to run the country and fend off a rebellion that has its roots in a youth-led uprising, which the army suppressed with lethal force. Min Aung Hlaing had earlier this month said the election would take place either in December this year, or January 2026, providing a timeframe for the first time during a visit to Belarus. The junta conducted a census last year as part of preparations to create a voter list, for which it said a full on-ground survey was compiled in only 145 of Myanmar\u2019s 330 townships. It says 53 parties have signed up to contest the election. Opponents of the military government have said they would disrupt the vote and have asked other countries not to recognise the outcome, saying it will be held against the will of the people. Min Aung Hlaing said the military was fighting a \u201cjust war\u201d against rebels bent on destroying the country, urging them to give up their armed campaign and pursue political solutions through dialogue. Some analysts say the holding of the ballot could trigger even more violence and Myanmar\u2019s neighbours in the Southeast Asian bloc ASEAN have told the junta to prioritise peace over an election."

(AP photo) Taiwan is considering a variety of responses to potential new tariffs from the United States, including increasing energy imports and reducing the island\u2019s own tariffs to balance bilateral trade, government officials said on Thursday.

            "text": "The U.S. judge whom President Donald Trump has argued should be impeached for blocking him from using wartime powers to deport Venezuelan migrants is set to hear a new lawsuit over administration officials\u2019 use of the messaging app Signal to share highly sensitive military plans. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington was assigned on Wednesday to a lawsuit alleging Trump officials violated federal record-keeping laws by using a Signal group chat to discuss looming military action against Yemen\u2019s Houthis. The revelation that highly sensitive attack plans were shared on a commercial messaging app, possibly on personal cellphones, has triggered outrage in Washington and calls from Democrats that members of Trump\u2019s national security team be fired over the leaks. The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday by a liberal-leaning government watchdog group, American Oversight, which argued that officials failed to implement measures to prevent the automatic deletion of messages in the Signal chat, in violation of their duties under the Federal Records Act. The lawsuit seeks a court order declaring their actions unlawful and an injunction requiring Trump administration officials including Hegseth to preserve records and recover any deleted materials to the extent possible. The administration has not responded to the lawsuit. But officials have said no classified information was shared on Signal, which White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called an approved app loaded onto government phones at the Pentagon, Department of State and Central Intelligence Agency. The case was assigned to Boasberg, the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, through the court\u2019s usual random assignment process, a court spokesperson said. Boasberg has been at the center of an escalating dispute with the Trump administration, which has raised concerns among the president\u2019s critics about a potentially looming constitutional crisis if the administration defies judicial decisions. The judge last week instructed Justice Department lawyers to give him a justification for the administration\u2019s failure to return the flights carrying alleged Venezuelan gang members deported to El Salvador on March 15 despite his order blocking such deportations for two weeks. Also Read | US intel chief Tulsi Gabbard admits reporter\u2019s inclusion on Signal chat was \u2018mistake\u2019 The administration has said the deportations were carried out under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act. Justice Department lawyers on Tuesday reiterated their position that the flights did not violate Boasberg\u2019s order. Trump last week called for Boasberg\u2019s impeachment. That prompted a rare rebuke from Chief U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Roberts, who said in a statement \u201cimpeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,\u201d which can be appealed. Republican lawmakers have filed resolutions seeking the impeachment of Boasberg and five other judges who have stymied Trump\u2019s agenda as the White House has continued to ramp up attacks on the judiciary."

Rumeysa Ozturk, 30, had just left her home in Somerville to meet with friends Tuesday night when she was detained by U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents, lawyer Mahsa Khanbabai said in a petition filed in Boston federal court.

Kumar did not name the student, but Tufts University spokesperson Patrick Collins confirmed that Ozturk is a doctoral student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani issued an order on Tuesday giving the government until Friday to answer why Ozturk was being detained. Talwani also ordered that Ozturk not be moved outside the District of Massachusetts without providing advance notice. Ozturk was one of four students last March who co-authored an op-ed piece in The Tufts Daily, criticizing the university\u2019s response to its community union Senate passing resolutions demanding that Tufts \u201cacknowledge the Palestinian genocide,\u201d disclose its investments and divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel. Students and faculty elsewhere have also recently had visas revoked or were blocked from entering the U.S. because they attended demonstrations or publicly expressed support for Palestinians. Before attending Tufts, Ozturk graduated with a master\u2019s degree from the Developmental Psychology program at Teachers College at Columbia University in New York, according to an alumni spotlight article in 2021. Her focus was children\u2019s media. She was also a 2018 Fulbright scholar at Columbia. Reyyan Bilge, a psychology professor at Northeastern University and friend of Ozturk, described her as a \u201csoft spoken, kind and gentle soul\u201d who is deeply focused on her research and not closely involved in the campus protests."

(Reuters) The first of five judges on Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court reviewing charges against former President Jair Bolsonaro on Wednesday voted for him to stand trial for allegedly conspiring to overthrow the government after he lost a 2022 election. The court is widely expected to put Bolsonaro on trial, according to sources familiar with the judges\u2019 deliberations. If found guilty, Bolsonaro could face a lengthy prison sentence stretching over two decades. In his opening remarks on Wednesday, Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing the case, screened dramatic footage of Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters storming government buildings in violent scenes that unfolded just a week after the inauguration of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in January 2023.

(File Photo) Sri Lanka\u2019s former president Ranil Wickremesinghe has criticised President Anura Kumara Dissanayake-led government for failing to move ahead with a Renewable Energy Project in Mannar with Indian Conglomerate, Adani. Wickremesinghe made these remarks during a televised discussion on Saturday the text of which was released on Monday. He also stressed the need for Sri Lanka to enhance economic cooperation with India to maximise results for the island nation. Wickremesinghe said during his two-year term in 2022, he emphasised a South India-focused economic framework in areas of renewable energy, agriculture, and trade links. \u201cI explored many avenues for economic cooperation with India. Regrettably, the current government has failed to pursue the Adani renewable project in Mannar.\u201d He criticised them for failing to move ahead with the Renewable Energy Project in Mannar with Indian Conglomerate, Adani. He said he saw no logic in the NPP government\u2019s attempt to renegotiate the Adani green energy project. \u201cThis would adversely affect all Indian investments,\u201d Wickremesinghe said. On February 13, Adani Green Energy, the renewable arm of billionaire Gautam Adani\u2019s conglomerate, withdrew from two proposed wind power projects in Sri Lanka, following the Island nation\u2019s new government deciding to renegotiate tariffs. The company was to invest a total of USD 1 billion in generating electricity from wind at two projects and laying transmitting lines to take it to users. The plan came under the scrutiny of the newly elected administration under President Dissanayake who wanted to reduce electricity costs. The NPP in the run-up to last year\u2019s presidential election said it would cancel the Adani renewable project in the northeastern region. After gaining power, the NPP Cabinet decided to renegotiate by holding onto the position that the purchase price agreed by the previous Wickremesinghe administration was expensive and hinted at corruption. In response, Adani said they have decided to respectfully withdraw from the USD 400 million project after already incurring a five million dollar expenditure on it. President Dissanayake said Sri Lanka had received bids for renewable projects which would cost the purchasing price half the Adani offered 8.26 US cents per unit.

(Photo/X/@prdthailand) Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra faces a no-confidence motion in parliament starting on Monday, with the opposition set to grill her over an underperforming economy and her powerful father\u2019s perceived influence over her administration. Despite lukewarm ratings in opinion polls, Paetongtarn comes into the debate in a firm position, with no signs of turmoil in a ruling coalition that commands a parliamentary majority, making it unlikely the motion will prosper when it goes to a vote on Wednesday. The opposition People\u2019s Party has accused Paetongtarn of taking direction from her father, divisive political heavyweight Thaksin Shinawatra, a billionaire former premier who is banned from holding office over a conviction for conflicts of interest and abuse of power that kept him in self-exile for 15 years. Thaksin, Thailand\u2019s most influential and polarising politician, has loomed large over Thai politics for the past 24 years. He returned home in 2023 and spent six months in detention in hospital under a government led by the Pheu Thai Party he founded, before being released on parole. He has spoken openly and frequently about policies that include legalising gambling and adopting cryptocurrency and championed a $14 billion handout scheme to stimulate the economy, all of which the Pheu Thai-led government has pursued. Paetongtarn has insisted her government is not under anyone\u2019s influence, while Thaksin, 75, has said he is retired and only offers advice. The government\u2019s economic measures so far have yet to spur significant growth in Southeast Asia\u2019s second-largest economy, with last year\u2019s 2.5% expansion far adrift of regional peers. Lawmakers will be unable to name Thaksin during the motion due to parliamentary rules that say outsiders should not be mentioned. After weeks of debate on the issue, the house speaker has allowed \u201cfamily member\u201d to be used. \u201cThe opposition\u2019s tactic to delegitimise Paetongtarn\u2019s leadership is not new because she already faces criticism from society,\u201d said Yuttaporn Issarachai, a political scientist at Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University \u201cThe focus on Thaksin\u2019s role and interference makes it too political and not beneficial to public, instead of raising issues on the economy and security,\u201d Yuttaporn said. Paetongtarn, 38, took over as premier in August after political ally Srettha Thavisin was ousted by a court over an ethics violation. She is the fourth member of the Shinawatra family to hold the top post. \u2018What sort of statements are you making\u2019: SC to MP minister over remarks on Col Qureshi OpinionIn the aftermath of Pahalgam, India must look at itself again"

Police and fire crews arrived at just after 10 p.m. Friday to a chaotic scene at Young Park, where an unauthorized car show had drawn about 200 people, police said in a news conference. Gunshot victims ranging in age from 16 to 36 were treated there or taken to hospitals.

            "text": "People make their way through the downtown historic district in St. Augustine, Florida. (AP photo) Lori Matthias and her husband had tired of Atlanta traffic when they moved to St. Augustine, Florida, in 2023. For Mike Waldron and his wife, moving from the Boston area in 2020 to a place that bills itself as \u201cthe nation\u2019s oldest city\u201d was motivated by a desire to be closer to their adult children. They were among thousands of white-collar, remote workers who migrated to the St. Augustine area in recent years, transforming the touristy beach town into one of the top remote work hubs in the United States. Matthias fell in love with St. Augustine\u2019s small-town feeling, trading the hour-long commute she had in Atlanta for bumping into friends and acquaintances while running errands. \u201cThe whole pace here is slower and I\u2019m attracted to that,\u201d said Matthias, who does sales and marketing for a power tool company. \u201cMy commute is like 30 steps from my kitchen to my office. It\u2019s just different. It\u2019s just relaxed and friendly.\u201d Centuries before becoming a remote work hub, the St. Augustine area was claimed by the Spanish crown in the early 16th century after explorer Juan Ponce de Leon\u2019s arrival. In modern times, it is best known for its Spanish architecture of terra cotta roofs and arched doorways, tourist-carrying trollies, a historic fort, an alligator farm, lighthouses, and a shipwreck museum. In St. Johns County, home to St. Augustine, the percentage of workers who did their jobs from home nearly tripled from 8.6% in 2018 to almost 24% in 2023, moving the northeast Florida county into the top ranks of US counties with the largest share of people working remotely, according to US Census Bureau figures. Only counties with a heavy presence of tech, finance, and government workers in metro Washington, Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, and Dallas, as well as two counties in North Carolina\u2019s Research Triangle, had a larger share of their workforce working from home. But these were counties much more populous than the 335,000 residents in St. Johns County, which has grown by more than a fifth during this decade. Scott Maynard, a vice president of economic development for the county\u2019s chamber of commerce, attributes the initial influx of new residents to Florida\u2019s lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in businesses and schools in the fall of 2020 while much of the country remained locked down. \u201cA lot of people were relocating here from the Northeast, the Midwest, and California so that their children could get back to a face-to-face education,\u201d Maynard said. \u201cThat brought in a tremendous number of people who had the ability to work remotely and wanted their children back in a face-to-face school situation.\u201d The influx of new residents has brought growing pains, particularly when it comes to affordable housing since many of the new remote workers moving into the area are wealthier than locals and able to outbid them on homes, officials said. Waldron, a sales executive in the health care industry, was able to sell his Boston home at the height of the pandemic and purchase a three-bedroom, two-bath home in a gated community by a golf course outside St. Augustine, where \u201cthings really worked out to be less expensive down here.\u201d The flexibility offered by fast wireless internet and the popularity of online meeting platforms since the start of the pandemic also helped."

A public safety law signed by the governor in February included enhanced penalties for mass-shooting threats, fentanyl trafficking and repeated vehicle thefts, while also banning devices \u2014 such as the Glock switch \u2014 that convert guns into automatic weapons. Lawmakers overhauled the state\u2019s red-flag gun law, under which firearms may be temporarily removed from people who may pose a danger. The update explicitly authorizes police officers to file petitions and removes a 48-hour waiting period for firearm relinquishment. Legislators also sent the governor bills that establish a trust fund to underwrite an expansion of addiction and mental health services, while identifying gaps in the system. Legislators are grappling with public concern about not only crime but also the proliferation of homeless encampments in New Mexico. Beyond New Mexico, a tough-on-crime approach is back in political favour, with Republicans and Democrats alike promoting new law enforcement initiatives in state capitols. Nationwide, nearly 8 in 10 voters in the US said they were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d concerned about crime in their own communities, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 1,20,000 voters conducted during the fall election. The percentage saying, they were very concerned was higher than the national rate in New Mexico and several other states, including Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and California.

            "text": "The British government has ordered an investigation into the country\u2019s \u201cenergy resilience\u201d after an electrical substation fire shut Heathrow Airport for almost a day and raised concerns about the UK\u2019s ability to withstand disasters or attacks on critical infrastructure. While Heathrow Airport said it was now \u201cfully operational,\u201d thousands of passengers remained stuck, and airlines warned that severe disruption will last for days as they scramble to relocate planes and crews and get travellers to their destinations. Inconvenienced passengers, angry airlines and concerned politicians all want answers about how one seemingly accidental fire could shut down Europe\u2019s busiest air hub. \u201cThis is a huge embarrassment for Heathrow airport. It\u2019s a huge embarrassment for the country that a fire in one electricity substation can have such a devastating effect,\u201d said Toby Harris, a Labour Party politician who heads the National Preparedness Commission, a group that campaigns to improve resilience. Also read | UK\u2019s Heathrow airport shut for a day after massive fire wipes out power, disrupts flights Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said he\u2019d asked the National Energy System Operator, which oversees UK gas and electricity networks, to \u201curgently investigate\u201d the fire, \u201cto understand any wider lessons to be learned on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure.\u201d It is expected to report initial findings within six weeks. \u201cThe government is determined to do everything it can to prevent a repeat of what happened at Heathrow,\u201d Miliband said. Heathrow announced its own review, to be led by former transport secretary Ruth Kelly, a member of the airport\u2019s board Heathrow Chairman Paul Deighton said Kelly will look at \u201cthe robustness and execution of Heathrow\u2019s crisis management plans, the airport\u2019s response during the incident and how the airport recovered.\u201d \u2022 Stalled journeys More than 1,300 flights were cancelled and some 200,000 people stranded Friday after an overnight fire at a substation 3.2 km away cut power to Heathrow, and to more than 60,000 properties. Laura Fritschie from Kansas City was on vacation with her family in Ireland when she learned that her father had died. On Saturday she was stranded at Heathrow after her BA flight to Chicago was cancelled at the last minute. \u201cI\u2019m very frustrated,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was my first big vacation with my kids since my husband died, and \u2026 now this. So I just want to go home.\u201d \u2022 Shutdown points to a broader problem Residents in west London described hearing a large explosion and then seeing a fireball and clouds of smoke when the blaze ripped through the substation. The fire was brought under control after seven hours, but the airport was shut for almost 18 hours. A handful of flights took off and landed late Friday. Police said they do not consider the fire suspicious, and the London Fire Brigade said its investigation would focus on the substation\u2019s electrical distribution equipment. Still, the huge impact of the fire left authorities facing questions about Britain\u2019s creaking infrastructure, much of which has been privatized since the 1980s. The centre-left Labour government has vowed to improve the UK\u2019s delay-plagued railways, its aged water system and its energy network, promising to reduce carbon emissions and increase energy independence through investment in wind and other renewable power sources. Chief executive Thomas Woldbye said he was \u201cproud\u201d of the way airport and airline staff had responded. \u201cThe airport didn\u2019t shut for days. We shut for hours,\u201d he told the BBC. Woldbye said Heathrow\u2019s backup power supply, designed for emergencies, worked as expected, but it wasn\u2019t enough to run the whole airport, which uses as much energy as a small city. But Willie Walsh, who heads aviation trade organization IATA, said the episode \u201cbegs some serious questions.\u201d \u201cHow is it that critical infrastructure \u2013 of national and global importance \u2013 is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative? If that is the case, as it seems, then it is a clear planning failure by the airport,\u201d he said. Walsh said \u201cHeathrow has very little incentive to improve\u201d because airlines, not the airport, have to pay the cost of looking after disrupted passengers. No back-up plan Friday\u2019s disruption was one of the most serious since the 2010 eruption of Iceland\u2019s Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which shut Europe\u2019s airspace for days.

At a joint news conference after the talks, Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya said he, his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi and South Korea\u2019s Cho Tae-yul agreed on the need to promote mutual understanding and tackle shared, multi-generational concerns to gain wider support for trilateral cooperation.

The three-way meetings are an accomplishment for Japan, which has historical and territorial disputes with both China and South Korea. An earlier trilateral meeting was held in South Korea last year. Cho, whose country chaired their leaders\u2019 first summit after a four-and-half-year hiatus due to the pandemic, said the ongoing global crisis makes the trilateral cooperation more important than ever and it is important to maintain their positive flow. Later Saturday, delegations from Japan and China were to meet separately to hold their first high-level economic dialogue since April 2019. Iwaya and Wang will also hold separate bilateral talks with Cho. US allies Japan and South Korea have rapidly improved ties, as they share mutual concerns over China\u2019s growing threat in the region. Tokyo and Beijing agreed in December to improve ties in spite of their differences, including disputes over a group of uninhabited islands that both claim, as well as China\u2019s territorial disputes with other countries in the South China Sea.

Israel warns it will escalate military operations Israel\u2019s renewed military offensive in the Gaza Strip threatens to be even deadlier and more destructive than the last, as it pursues wider aims with far fewer constraints. Defence Minister Israel Katz said Friday that his country would carry out operations in Gaza \u201cwith increasing intensity\u201d until Hamas frees the 59 hostages it holds \u2014 24 of whom are believed alive. \u201cThe more Hamas continues its refusal to release the kidnapped, the more territory it will lose to Israel,\u201d Katz said. The Israeli military said Friday its forces were planning fresh assaults into three neighbourhoods west of Gaza City, and issued warnings on social media for Palestinians to evacuate the areas. The warnings came shortly after the military said it intercepted two rockets fired from northern Gaza that set off sirens in the Israeli coastal city of Ashkelon. Hamas had also fired three rockets the previous day, causing no casualties, in its first attack since Israel ended the ceasefire. Israeli forces advance in Gaza\u2019s north and south Israeli troops had moved Thursday toward the northern town of Beit Lahiya and the southern border city of Rafah, and resumed blocking Palestinians from entering northern Gaza, including Gaza City. Displaced Palestinians fled northern Gaza along a coastal road Friday carrying their belongings, firewood and other items on horse-drawn carts.

The Israeli army said it struck a militant in a Gaza City building and took steps to minimize civilian harm. It was not immediately clear if the army was referring to the same strike. And in the southern city of Rafah, Palestinian municipal officials said Israeli bombardments forced residents to move outdoors in rainy weather, deepening their suffering. Court delays Netanyahu\u2019s firing of Israeli security official In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2018s push to fire the country\u2019s domestic security chief has deepened a power struggle focused largely over who bears responsibility for the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack that sparked the war in Gaza. It also could set the stage for a crisis over the country\u2019s division of powers. Hundreds killed in Gaza since ceasefire collapsed Around 600 Palestinians have been killed since Israel relaunched the war with a wave of predawn airstrikes across Gaza on Tuesday, which came as many families slept or prepared to start the daily fast for the holy month of Ramadan. Israel had already cut off the supply of food, fuel and humanitarian aid to Gaza\u2019s roughly 2 million Palestinians, aiming to pressure Hamas over the ceasefire negotiations. The attack by Hamas-led militants on October 7, 2023, killed some 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. Most of the hostages have been freed in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more. Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants, but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.

            "text": "Protesters shout slogans during clashes with anti riot police during a protest against the arrest of Istanbul's Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu in Istanbul, Turkey. (Photo: AP) Tens of thousands of people rallied at Istanbul\u2019s city hall for a third day on Friday to protest the arrest of Istanbul\u2019s mayor and top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, despite the Turkish leader\u2019s stern warning that street protests would not be tolerated. The rally remained peaceful. However, some 500 metres away, police used pepper spray and tear gas to push back hundreds of protesters who tried to break through a barricade in front of the city\u2019s historic aqueduct and threw flares and other objects at them. Water cannons were used to break up demonstrations in Ankara, the capital, as well as in the Aegean coastal city of Izmir. Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was arrested in a dawn raid on his residence on Wednesday over alleged corruption and terror links, escalating a crackdown on opposition figures and dissenting voices. Several other prominent figures, including two district mayors, were also detained. A man with the Turkish flag on his back stands in front of anti riot police officers during clashes in a rally against the arrest of Istanbul\u2019s Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, in Istanbul, Turkey. (AP) Many view the arrest as a politically driven attempt to remove a popular opposition figure and key challenger to Erdogan in the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. Government officials reject accusations that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated and insist that Turkey\u2019s courts operate independently. Imamoglu was questioned by police for four hours over corruption accusations, during which he denied all the charges, the Cumhuriyet newspaper and other media reported. He was expected to be transferred to a courthouse Saturday evening for questioning by prosecutors. His arrest has sparked the largest protests since 2013, when Turkey was rocked by mass anti-government demonstrations that left eight people dead. On Friday, the leader of Turkey\u2019s main opposition party, Ozgur Ozel, renewed a call on supporters to take to the streets for peaceful demonstrations, while authorities widened a ban on protests and criticised the appeal as irresponsible. \u201cI invite tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and millions, to peacefully demonstrate, express our democratic reaction, and exercise our constitutional rights,\u201d he said. Addressing the rally, Ozel accused Erdogan of using the judiciary as tool after failing to defeat the mayor \u201cin a fair way.\u201d Erdogan, increasingly authoritarian after more than two decades in office, said the government would not tolerate street protests and accused the opposition party of links to corruption and terror organizations. \u201cAn anti-corruption operation in Istanbul is being used as an excuse to stir unrest in our streets. I want it to be known that we will not allow a handful of opportunists to bring unrest to Turkey just to protect their plundering schemes,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cPointing to the streets instead of courtrooms to defend theft, plunder, lawlessness and fraud is a grave irresponsibility,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cJust as we have not surrendered to street terrorism until now, we will not bow to vandalism in the future either.\u201d The most violent clash was at Ankara\u2019s Middle East Technical University late Thursday, when police fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse the demonstration. Students said rubber bullets were used, but the government denied that. Police officers use pepper spray during clashes with people as they protest against the arrest of Istanbul\u2019s Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, in Istanbul, Turkey. (AP) On Friday, authorities in Ankara and Izmir announced a five-day ban on demonstrations, following a similar measure imposed earlier in Istanbul. Authorities on Friday announced more road closures in Istanbul and shuttered metro stops near the university in Ankara. Imamoglu\u2019s arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People\u2019s Party\u2019s presidential candidate in a primary on Sunday. Ozel has said that the primary, where around 1.5 million delegates can vote, will go ahead as planned. The opposition party has also urged citizens to participate in a symbolic election on Sunday \u2014 through improvised ballot boxes to be set up across Turkey \u2014 to show solidarity with Imamoglu. Analysts say Imamoglu could be removed from office and replaced by a \u201ctrustee mayor,\u201d if he is formally charged with links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey and its Western allies. Meanwhile, Ozel also said the opposition party would hold an extraordinary party congress on April 6, to thwart any attempts by the authorities to appoint a \u201ctrustee chairman\u201d to lead the party. The decision came amid speculation that authorities could annul the party\u2019s last congress, held in 2023, over alleged vote-buying and other irregularities, and appoint a handpicked leader. On Friday, the Borsa Istanbul\u2019s benchmark index dropped by around 7 per cent, prompting temporary trading suspensions aimed at preventing panic-driven sell-offs."

Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, during his visit to the Badami Bagh Cantonment in Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday, strongly echoed Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s tough message to Pakistan, calling for its nuclear weapons to be placed under international supervision. Singh, who interacted with troops during his visit, emphasised that Pakistan\u2019s repeated and irresponsible nuclear threats demand global scrutiny, suggesting the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should oversee Islamabad\u2019s nuclear arsenal. \"The world knows that our army's aim is accurate and when they hit the target, they leave the counting to the enemies. How strong is India's pledge against terrorism today, it can be known from the fact that we did not even care about their nuclear blackmail. The whole world has seen how irresponsibly Pakistan has threatened India,\u201d Singh said while addressing the troops. \u201cToday, from the land of Srinagar, I want to raise this question whether nuclear weapons are safe in the hands of such an irresponsible and rogue nation. I believe that Pakistan's nuclear weapons should be taken under the supervision of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),\" he added. His remarks came just days after Prime Minister Modi issued a stern warning on Tuesday, declaring, \u201cWhen our armed forces neutralise nuclear blackmail, our enemies realise the meaning of \u2018Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019.\u201d In a powerful address from the Valley, Singh underscored India\u2019s unwavering resolve in the fight against terrorism. He reiterated that under the Modi government\u2019s redefined doctrine, any terror attack on Indian soil will be treated as an act of war. \"The entire country is proud of what you did during Operation Sindoor under the able leadership and guidance of our Prime Minister Narendra Modi. I may be your Defence Minister but before that I am a citizen of India. The people of Jammu and Kashmir have expressed their anger towards Pakistan and terrorism with complete unity. I congratulate the people of Jammu and Kashmir. I have come to feel the energy that has destroyed the enemy. The way you destroyed the Pakistani posts and weavers across the border, the enemy can never forget that\", Singh said. He further clarified that no dialogue with Pakistan will be possible unless it focusses solely on terrorism and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). During his visit, Singh also inspected Pakistani shells that were dropped at Badami Bagh Cantonment. He also visited Badami Bagh Cantonment and is currently interacting with the troops. Notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Punjab\u2019s Adampur air base on Tuesday and met with the pilots and support staff who carried out Operation Sindoor in which India took out nine terror targets deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir on May 7. Adampur was one of the four Indian Air Force stations that was targeted by Pakistan on the intervening night of May 9-10 after India struck their terror camps."

He added India and the UAE share a partnership that is not only growing, but it is evolving.\" The India-UAE relationship is beyond economics, it is a time-tested cultural bridge, he said, adding that the relationship is \"deeply cultural, emotional, and human.\" He noted that over 3.5 million Indians call the UAE their home, and they are stakeholders in the UAE\u2019s growth. \"The India-UAE partnership offers a rare constant: a relationship based on trust, pragmatism, and mutual benefit,\" Aroon Purie said at the landmark gathering of policymakers, business leaders, and innovators shaping the future of India-UAE collaboration. Good morning, and a very warm welcome to the inaugural India Today India-UAE Conclave in the magnificent city of Dubai. I first came to Dubai in 1970, which is 55 years ago. I was invited to set up a printing press for the government here. As you can imagine, there was very little here at that time. Even some of the government offices were in cabins, the kind used at construction sites. Now, when I see the UAE, I regard it as one of the miracles of the world. The transformation of a desert into one of the world\u2019s most advanced cosmopolitan cities. Dubai and Abu Dhabi in particular. I congratulate the rulers of UAE past and present for giving this miracle to the world. For over two decades, the India Today Conclaves have hosted thought leaders, change makers, and global voices to reflect on the India story. Today, that story is expanding its canvas from South Asia to West Asia. From the local to the truly global. We have gathered here to celebrate what we call \u201cIndia and the UAE \u2014 two nations, one future\u201d. And what better city than Dubai, this bold, visionary metropolis that reflects the very spirit of transformation, connectivity and ambition that we aim to spotlight in the India-UAE relationship. Much like India, this country is diverse, dynamic, and determined to define the future on its own terms. I firmly believe that the India-UAE story is one of the most underappreciated diplomatic achievements of the 21st century. We are here not just as observers of a bilateral relationship. We are here as participants in a growing partnership. One that has moved far beyond trade into shared aspirations, cultural embrace, and geopolitical convergence. India and the UAE share a relationship that is time-tested, multi-dimensional, and future-ready. From flourishing trade to growing cultural bonds. From political alignment to strategic convergence, this is a partnership that is not only growing, but it is evolving. India and the UAE have long enjoyed strong trade relations. The UAE is India\u2019s third-largest trading partner, and India is the UAE\u2019s second-largest export destination. Bilateral trade has already crossed $83 billion, and is expected to surge past $100 billion within this decade. Both countries have eliminated duties; the UAE has cleaned up 97.4% of its tariff lines, corresponding to 99% of imports from India. India reciprocated by eliminating duties on over 80% of its tariff lines, covering 90% of its exports in value terms. In the last 25 years, India has received cumulative FDI worth more than $22 billion from the UAE, making it the 7th largest investor in India. Like a true friend, Indians are also betting on the story of the transformation of the UAE. Amid this flux, the India-UAE partnership offers a rare constant: a relationship based on trust, pragmatism, and mutual benefit. At the G20 Summit, hosted by India, the UAE was a prominent voice in forging a new economic corridor - the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) connecting India to Europe via the Middle East a project that is not just about infrastructure, but about re-imagining supply chains, data flows, and energy routes in the 21st century. In climate diplomacy, both countries are collaborating to shape the green agenda with India\u2019s renewables push and the UAE\u2019s hosting of COP28 forming a timely convergence. The subsea cable will be an epitome of the energy friendship. India-UAE partnership is not stuck in the past it is leaping into the future. We are seeing innovation in fintech, digital payments, and emerging tech and education. The India-UAE relationship is beyond economics, it is a time-tested cultural bridge. It is deeply cultural, emotional, and human. Over 3.5 million Indians call the UAE their home. They are not migrants. They are stakeholders in UAE\u2019s growth. Bollywood thrives here. Cricket unites us, and Indian cuisine spices up the Emirati palette. The UAE is home to the only Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi, and India is home to one of the oldest mosques in Kerala. This is civilisational coexistence in action. India Today is proud to host this Conclave here in Dubai. We believe that meaningful partnerships thrive on dialogue, transparency, and mutual understanding. In a world of polarised narratives and fractured facts, the role of credible journalism and forums like this becomes even more vital. This Conclave is our modest attempt to bring that story into the spotlight. Not just to celebrate it, but to build upon it. It is the beginning of a deeper conversation about what two ambitious nations can achieve when they trust, trade, and think together."

            "title": "Is this appropriate? Top court slams minister over remarks on Col Sofiya Qureshi",
            "text": "The Supreme Court on Thursday came down heavily on Madhya Pradesh BJP Minister Kunwar Vijay Shah over his remarks against Indian Army officer Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, refusing to intervene in the FIR lodged against him for now. A day after the Madhya Pradesh High Court ordered an FIR against BJP Minister Kunwar Vijay Shah for \u201chate speech\u201d against Army\u2019s Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, the minister had approached the Supreme Court for relief. In a plea filed late night on Wednesday, Shah has sought stay on the High Court order, on grounds that his statement has been \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d. During the urgent mentioning of Shah\u2019s plea challenging the Madhya Pradesh High Court\u2019s May 14 order directing the registration of an FIR, Chief Justice of India (CJI) BR Gavai, heading the bench, said, \u201cA person holding constitutional office is expected to act responsibly. What kind of statements is he making? Is it appropriate for a minister to make such statements?\u201d The High Court had initiated suo motu action against Shah for calling Colonel Qureshi a \u201csister of terrorists,\u201d describing his comments as \u201cscurrilous\u201d and \u201clanguage of the gutters.\u201d Shah\u2019s counsel told the Supreme Court that the minister had apologised, expressed remorse, and that his statement was distorted and hyped by the media. \u201cHe has expressed remorse, and his statements have been misunderstood,\u201d the counsel submitted. However, the CJI observed, \u201cEvery sentence uttered by a person in such a position is heard, especially when the country is going through a sensitive situation.\u201d He added, \u201cYou know who you are nothing will happen in 24 hours.\u201d The court did not pass any stay order on the FIR but agreed to hear the matter on Friday (May 16). A case has also been registered against Shah in Indore under relevant sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). The case was registered in compliance with a high court order, which called the minister's remarks \"disparaging and dangerous\". This came despite Vijay Shah issuing an unconditional apology for his remarks, which sparked nationwide outrage and drew flak from all quarters. \"I am not only ashamed and saddened by my statement but sincerely apologise from the bottom of my heart,\" Vijay Shah said in a video statement. The development came a day after Shah, while speaking at a government event, had said that the Prime Minister had sent a \"sister from the same community\" as those in Pakistan to avenge the April 22 terror attack in Kashmir\u2019s Pahalgam. \"Modi ji is striving for society. Those who widowed our daughters [in Pahalgam], we sent a sister of their own to teach them a lesson,\" he said. Shah's controversial remarks also provided political ammunition to the Congress, whose national president Mallikarjun Kharge called the comment \"insulting, shameful and vulgar\u201d, and demanded his immediate dismissal. During the hearing in the Madhya Pradesh High Court on Thursday, the court strongly criticised the state police over the manner in which the FIR was registered against BJP Minister Kunwar Vijay Shah. The bench questioned the FIR's substance, asking, \u201cIs this it? Have you read the FIR? Where are the ingredients of the offence?\u201d Observing that the FIR lacked any material that could constitute a cognisable offence, the court remarked that it had been \u201cdrafted in such a way that it can be quashed.\u201d The bench added, \u201cThere is nothing in the FIR.\u201d When the counsel admitted to not drafting the FIR, the court retorted, \u201cObviously you have not drafted it!\u201d The counsel submitted that the entire High Court order had been attached to the FIR, to which the court said, \u201cIt was registered last night but the content must be there in the FIR. If you have annexed the order, it will be read as part of the FIR.\u201d The court reiterated, \u201cThere has to be a cognisable offence,\u201d and questioned, \u201cWhere are the contents of those offences?\u201d It further said, \u201cThis FIR can easily be quashed.\u201d Responding to the court's observations, the Advocate General said, \u201cWe will act as the court directs, while the counsel requested the bench not to assume that they were protecting the accused. The court, however, remarked, \u201cThe intention is apparent from the act. The act shows that the contents of the FIR are not there.\u201d"

            "title": "Masterstroke or damage-control? BJP's caste census sets ball rolling in Bihar",
            "text": "BJP's move to include caste enumeration in the forthcoming census appeared to be shaped by past electoral setbacks. (File photo) In a politically significant decision ahead of the Bihar Assembly elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led central government has announced that caste enumeration will be conducted alongside the upcoming decennial national census. The move is widely interpreted as a calibrated attempt to counter the opposition INDIA bloc's growing demand for a nationwide caste census \u2014 an issue that has gained traction in Bihar's deeply caste-sensitive political landscape. The announcement comes amidst speculation that the BJP is seeking to pre-empt a possible division of Hindu votes along caste lines, which could undermine its electoral prospects in a state where identity politics has historically overshadowed religious consolidation. Bihar had already conducted a state-level caste survey in 2023 under Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led then Mahagathbandhan government, which included the Janata Dal (United), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), and the Congress. The survey\u2019s findings were made public on October 2, 2023. At the time, the decision to undertake the survey had received unanimous support from all parties in the state, including the BJP, which was in the opposition. Yet, demands for a nationwide enumeration persisted, with both Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his then-deputy Tejashwi Yadav pressing the Centre to take up the issue. Ironically, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, during recent visits to Bihar, criticised the state-conducted survey and called for a fresh national caste census \u2014 despite his party being part of the government that carried out the 2023 exercise. Political analysts view the Centre's decision as both a tactical masterstroke and a damage-control measure. \"The BJP has failed to project a strong Hindutva figure like Yogi Adityanath in Bihar and has had to engage with the region\u2019s entrenched caste arithmetic,\" said Abhay Mohan Jha, a Patna-based political commentator. By embracing caste enumeration, the BJP appeared to be adapting to the ground realities of Bihar's politics, where electoral outcomes have long been shaped more by caste coalitions than communal mobilisation. Analysts suggested that the saffron party is aiming to neutralise one of the Mahagathbandhan's central campaign planks, while simultaneously retaining key allies at the Centre, inlcluding Nitish Kumar and Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan. The BJP's move also appeared to be shaped by past electoral setbacks. In the 2015 Bihar elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav had successfully turned the tide in his favour after RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat suggested a review of the reservation policy \u2014 fuelling fears among OBCs, SCs, and STs of a rollback in affirmative action. Caste is still the cornerstone of electoral strategy in Bihar, with the RJD banking on its traditional Yadav-Muslim base, and the Janata Dal (United) leaning on support from Kurmis, Koeris, OBCs, and Mahadalits. \"Our demand for caste census is longstanding. It will provide accurate data for planning and ensure the development of marginalised communities,\" Nitish Kumar said in response to the Centre's recent announcement. Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Chaudhary echoed the sentiment from the BJP's side, stating, \"The caste census will enable better socio-economic planning for deprived sections of society\". RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav hailed the move as a belated acknowledgement of socialist politics. \"The first caste survey was done in Bihar under our 17-month Mahagathbandhan government. The issues we raised three decades ago are now setting the national agenda. We'll continue to make these Sanghis dance to our tune,\" he said. Even Rahul Gandhi welcomed the government's 'sudden' decision to include caste enumeration in the forthcoming census after \"11 years of opposing it\". He also credited Congress's sustained campaign and said that it was the pressure put by the grand old party on the government for the caste census has worked. \"It doesn't matter what the BJP thinks. We have shown that we can pressure the BJP into doing the caste census,\" Gandhi said at a press conference. \"We wholeheartedly welcome this decision but demand a clear implementation timeline,\" the Gandhi scion said."

            "text": "While New Delhi rushed in aid after the massive earthquake in Turkey, the country helped Pakistan in attacking India by not just supplying drones but providing military operatives too. Feeling betrayed by Ankara, Indians are cancelling trips to Turkey and calls to boycott Turkish products are getting louder. From politicians and actors to military veterans, everyone is lending voice to the \"Boycott Turkey\" movement. The impact? Even as tourist booking cancellations to Turkey or Turkiye rose by 250%, Indian corporates promised to shun Ankara, JNU suspended an agreement with a Turkish university, and film producers announced a boycott of the country for film shoots. Ankara\u2019s active military support to Pakistan has been perceived by Indians as a clear betrayal. Public anger has erupted against Aknara, which India has called a 'dost'. Indians are now giving it back to Turkey with 'trade and tourism drones'. Not just Turkey, but Azerbaijan too has drawn the ire of Indians as it supported Pakistan and condemned India's strikes on terror camps as part of Operation Sindoor. The triad of Pakistan, Azerbaijan, and Turkey, bolstered by defence and ideological ties, have traditionally strategically aligned with China, which is probably India's biggest rival. Following reports of active Turkish military support to Pakistan during its attacks on Indian military assets and civilian areas, public sentiment in India has sharply turned against Turkey. A popular travel destination and key trading partner, Turkey now faces growing calls for boycott and diplomatic reassessment. \"Terror and talks cannot coexist. Terror and trade cannot go together. Terror and tourism cannot go together,\" Colonel Ajay Kumar Raina (retired) posted on X, adding #BoycottTurkey. \"Can we please cancel our bookings for Turkey? This is my request to all Indian celebs/influencers and travellers. This is the least we can do as Indians. #BoycottTurkey (sic),\" Ganguly, who is also a member of the BJP, wrote on X. Industrialist Harsh Goenka has called on Indian citizens to refrain from travelling to Turkey and Azerbaijan. Cox & Kings announced it is temporarily pausing all new travel offerings to Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan in response to rising public sentiment. Amid growing boycott calls, MakeMyTrip reported a 60% drop in bookings to Turkey or Turkiye and Azerbaijan over the past week, with cancellations surging by 250%. \"Indian travellers have expressed strong sentiments over the past one week, with bookings for Azerbaijan and Turkey decreasing by 60%, while cancellations have surged by 250% during the same period,\" said MakeMyTrip in a statement. The backlash from Indian travellers to Turkey could deal a blow to its booming tourism industry, which earned $54.3 billion in 2023. Though Indian tourists don't form a big chunk of foreign travellers to Turkiye, but the numbers have been rising sharply. With over 2.7 lakh Indian tourists visiting Turkey in 2023, an 18% rise from 2022, and projections of over 3 lakh for 2024, the boycott risks stalling the upward trend, especially in the lucrative segments of Indian weddings and corporate events that Turkey has actively courted through targeted marketing and improved air connectivity with India. In 2025, around 2.4 lakh Indians travelled to Azerbaijan, according to data shared by EaseMyTrip. Former President of the Travel Agents Association of India, Jyoti Mayal, told the news agency ANI, \"Fifty percent of the bookings made for Turkey and Azerbaijan from India have been cancelled. We have helped and supported Turkey and Azerbaijan a lot in the tourism sector. We must show our displeasure over how they have behaved towards India. We are not supporting travel to these countries.\" Turkish companies operating in India have also faced growing boycott calls amid rising anger over Ankara's support for Pakistan following deadly drone attacks on Indian soil. Turkey's Celibi Aviation handles high-security tasks at eight Indian airports, including in Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai. It manages 58,000 flights in India annually. Aviation assets are high-sensitive critical infrastructure, and Indians are now calling for a bar on Celibi. \"No Bollywood or Indian film projects will be shot in Turkey, effective immediately. No Indian producers, production houses, directors, or financiers will be allowed to take any film, television, or digital content projects to Turkey,\" the AICWA said on X, urging an end to any collaboration with Turkish artists and other creative professionals. Indian traders who dealt with Turkish products have also joined calls to keep the latter's products off the shelves. If the Indian boycott of trade and commerce with Turkey continues, it could spell trouble for the latter. India's key exports to Turkey include mineral fuels, electrical machinery, automotive components, organic chemicals, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and iron and steel. India imports marble, gold, apples, mineral oils, chemicals, and iron and steel from Turkey. There is some concern regarding Indian exports to Turkey. It is believed some components imported by Turkey from India could be used in its drones. Engineering goods account for the largest chunk of India's exports to Turkey, and a large portion of India's exports can be used in making drones. Given that Turkey accounts for around 1.5% of India's exports and 0.5% of its imports, the calls for Turkish boycotts cast a shadow on the overseas commerce of the sick man of Europe. During India's Operation Sindoor, the Turkey-Pakistan nexus deployed 300\u2013400 Turkish-made Asisguard Songar drones, targeting 36 Indian military and civilian sites. At least 18 civilians lost their lives. Operation Sindoor was triggered by the Pakistan-sponsored Pahalgam attack on April 22 where 26 tourists lost their lives. Even as India launched Operation Sindoor to eliminate terrorists and their headquarters in Pakistan and POK, Islamabad found a helping hand in Turkish military hardware and personnel. Yes, it was not just China whose military hardware, like PL-15 missiles, HQ-9P ground-to-air missiles, JF-17 and J-10 fighter jets, that Pakistan used against India. The Pakistani military offensive, including cross-border, and LoC shelling and drone attacks, claimed more than a dozen Indian lives. Whether it was the Asisguard Songar, Bayraktar TB2, or YIHA drones, Pakistan\u2019s \"iron brother\" Turkey actively enabled Islamabad\u2019s offensive against India. Ankara not only supplied advanced weaponry but also deployed military personnel to assist Pakistan on the ground. This move by Turkey comes a couple of years after India rushed multiple C-17 Globemasters for humanitarian aid within 12 hours of the 2023 earthquake under Operation Dost. Even before the launch of Operation Sindoor, Turkey deployed the naval warship TCG Buyukada to Karachi Port on May 4. It also sent six C-130 Hercules military transport aircraft to Pakistan, carrying undisclosed combat equipment, reports said. Turkey extended not just military, but also diplomatic and moral support to Pakistan during its escalating tensions with India, with President Erdogan assuring Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif that Ankara stood by Pakistan's \"calm and restrained policies\" amid the crisis. Erdogan further endorsed Islamabad's actions, calling Pakistan\u2019s response \"appropriate\", signaling a clear alignment with Pakistan's stance. Despite India's lack of provocation and its swift help during Turkey\u2019s time of need, Ankara chose to repay its 'dost' with drones. For New Delhi, Turkey's aggression and direct involvement in aiding Pakistan should serve as a serious wake-up call. As the saying goes, if the 'dost' betrays, it may be time to redefine the 'dosti'. Though the government hasn't yet moved to take this up officially with Turkey, Indians have begun their attack, launching trade and tourism drones."

            "text": "At a time when the gap between the judiciary and the executive is widening, Justice BR Gavai, who was sworn in as the country's top-ranking judicial officer on Wednesday, will face several pressing questions to begin with -- from setting a timeline for the Governor and President\u2019s assent to bills, to the use of the Supreme Court\u2019s extraordinary powers under Article 142 to deliver complete justice. The newly sworn-in Chief Justice of India (CJI), BR Gavai, faces his first challenge in addressing the President's question on whether the Supreme Court can set a timeline for governors and the President, as observed by a two-judge bench in a landmark judgment in the Tamil Nadu Governor case. The President has used the powers conferred under Article 143 of the Constitution to seek advice on the Supreme Court's decision in the landmark Tamil Nadu governor judgement, with President Droupadi Murmu asking the top court: How can Supreme Court put a timeline when the Constitution does not?\" Chief Justice of India Gavai will now be required to set up a Constitution bench -- comprising five or more judges -- to provide an opinion to the 14 questions posed by President Droupadi Murmu. India Today TV has accessed the list of questions that were posed by President Murmu on Tuesday, day before Chief Justice of India Gavai took oath. Listed below are all the 14 questions referred to the Supreme Court: 1. What are the constitutional options before a Governor when a Bill is presented to him under Article 200 of the Constitution of India? 2. Is the Governor bound by the aid & advice tendered by the Council of Ministers while exercising all the options available with him when a Bill is presented before him under Article 200 of the Constitution of India? 3. Is the exercise of constitutional discretion by the Governor under Article 200 of the Constitution of India justiciable? 4. Is Article 361 of the Constitution of India an absolute bar to the judicial review in relation to the actions of a Governor under Article 200 of the Constitution of India? 5. In the absence of a constitutionally prescribed time limit, and the manner of exercise of powers by the Governor, can timelines be imposed and the manner of exercise be prescribed through judicial orders for the exercise of all powers under Article 200 of the Constitution of India by the Governor? 6. Is the exercise of constitutional discretion by the President under Article 201 of the Constitution of India justiciable? 7. In the absence of a constitutionally prescribed timeline and the manner of exercise of powers by the President, can timelines be imposed and the manner of exercise be prescribed through judicial orders for the exercise of discretion by the President under Article 201 of the Constitution of India? 8. In light of the constitutional scheme governing the powers of the President, is the President required to seek advice of the Supreme Court by way of a reference under Article 143 of the Constitution of India and take the opinion of the Supreme Court when the Governor reserves a Bill for the President's assent or otherwise? 9. Are the decisions of the Governor and the President under Article 200 and Article 201 of the Constitution of India, respectively, justiciable at a stage anterior into the law coming into force? Is it permissible for the Courts to undertake judicial adjudication over the contents of a Bill, in any manner, before it becomes law? 10. Can the exercise of constitutional powers and the orders of/by the President / Governor be substituted in any manner under Article 142 of the Constitution of India? 11. Is a law made by the State legislature a law in force without the assent of the Governor granted under Article 200 of the Constitution of India? 12. In view of the proviso to Article 145(3) of the Constitution of India, is it not mandatory for any bench of this Hon'ble Court to first decide as to whether the question involved in the proceedings before it is of such a nature which involves substantial questions of law as to the interpretation of constitution and to refer it to a bench of minimum five Judges? 13. Do the powers of the Supreme Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India limited to matters of procedural law or Article 142 of the Constitution of India extends to issuing directions /passing orders which are contrary to or inconsistent with existing substantive or procedural provisions of the Constitution or law in force? 14. Does the Constitution bar any other jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to resolve disputes between the Union Government and the State Governments except by way of a suit under Article 131 of the Constitution of India? Last month, the Vice President of India, Jagdeep Dhankhar, questioned the Supreme Court's use of its extraordinary powers under Article 142 to set a deadline for both the President and the Governor, and cleared 10 bills passed by the Tamil Nadu Assembly without the Executive's nod, calling it a case of \"judicial overreach.\" On April 12, the top court, in a first, ruled that the President must take a decision on the bills reserved by the Governor within three months. The bench observed that the powers of the President under Article 201 were subject to judicial review, thus setting the cat among the pigeons."

Sources said Purnam Kumar Shaw was kept blindfolded, deprived of sleep and verbally abused by Pakistani authorities. While Shaw was not subjected to physical torture, he was questioned on BSF deployments along the border. He also wasn't allowed to brush his teeth, sources said. The BSF jawan was arrested by the Pakistan Rangers after he mistakenly crossed over to Pakistani territory during duty in the Ferozepur sector on April 23. Throughout his captivity, Shaw, who belongs to the 24th BSF battalion, was taken to three undisclosed locations in Pakistan. One of the locations was near an airbase where he could hear the sounds of aircraft. During these movements, the jawan was mostly kept blindfolded. In one location, he was put in a jail cell. Sources said Pakistani officials, dressed in civilian clothes, questioned Shaw about BSF deployments along the border and sought details about senior officers posted at the International Border. He was also pressed to give the contact details, but as Shaw was not carrying a mobile phone at the time of his capture, as per BSF protocol, he was unable to provide the numbers. After the BSF jawan was handed over to Indian authorities at the Attari-Wagah border, Shaw was allowed to speak to his family. He underwent a formal debriefing and is reported to be in a stable physical and mental condition. As per protocol, the clothes he wore while in Pakistani custody were inspected and discarded. PK Shaw, who is from West Bengal's Hooghly district, was part of the BSF's 'Kisan Guard' that is deployed for the protection of Indian farmers. His release comes days after India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire following three days of armed hostilities across the LoC post India's 'Operation Sindoor', where it destroyed nine terrorist camps linked to groups Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT)."

During the hearing, the bench questioned the FIR's substance, asking, \u201cIs this it? Have you read the FIR? Where are the ingredients of the offence?\u201d Observing that the FIR lacked any material that could constitute a cognisable offence, the court remarked that it had been \u201cdrafted in such a way that it can be quashed.\u201d The bench added, \u201cThere is nothing in the FIR.\u201d In the interest of justice, the High Court said the investigation shall be closely monitored. \u201cThe FIR is to be amended to include the entirety of the High Court's earlier order in Para 12 \u2014 all details of actions by Vijay Shah are to be mentioned clearly.\" The court reiterated, \u201cThere has to be a cognisable offence,\u201d and asked, \u201cWhere are the contents of those offences?\u201d It further said, \u201cThis FIR can easily be quashed.\u201d When the counsel admitted to not drafting the FIR, the court retorted, \u201cObviously you have not drafted it!\u201d The counsel submitted that the entire High Court order had been attached to the FIR, to which the court said, \u201cIt was registered last night but the content must be there in the FIR. If you have annexed the order, it will be read as part of the FIR.\u201d Responding to the court's observations, the Advocate General said, \u201cWe will act as the court directs, while the counsel requested the bench not to assume that they were protecting the accused. The court, however, remarked, \u201cThe intention is apparent from the act. The act shows that the contents of the FIR are not there.\u201d The minister had approached the Supreme Court for relief a day after the Madhya Pradesh High Court ordered an FIR against him for \u201chate speech\u201d against Army\u2019s Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, A case has also been registered against Shah in Indore under relevant sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). The case was registered in compliance with a high court order, which called the minister's remarks \"disparaging and dangerous\". This came despite Vijay Shah issuing an unconditional apology for his remarks, which sparked nationwide outrage and drew flak from all quarters. \"I am not only ashamed and saddened by my statement but sincerely apologise from the bottom of my heart,\" Vijay Shah said in a video statement. The development came a day after Shah, while speaking at a government event, had said that the Prime Minister had sent a \"sister from the same community\" as those in Pakistan to avenge the April 22 terror attack in Kashmir\u2019s Pahalgam. \"Modi ji is striving for society. Those who widowed our daughters [in Pahalgam], we sent a sister of their own to teach them a lesson,\" he said."

In a video shared by Vogue India, Cruise was seen riding a bike in an all-black outfit, surrounded by security and cheering fans. Later, he stepped out of a hotel, smiled and waved at the crowd, and patiently posed for pictures before heading to the festival in a car, this time in a black tuxedo, white shirt, bow tie, and stylish sunglasses. As he reached the red carpet, a live orchestra welcomed him by playing the famous 'Mission: Impossible' theme. Cruise, along with his co-stars Simon Pegg, Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, and others, walked the red carpet and greeted the audience warmly. He also hugged Cannes director Thierry Frmaux, showing his excitement and gratitude. The highlight of the evening was, of course, the premiere of 'Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning', the eighth and possibly last film in the iconic spy series. After the screening, the film received a five-minute standing ovation. Fans were blown away by Cruise\u2019s daring stunts, especially a scene where he performs a three-minute knife fight on a submarine wearing only boxer shorts. After the screening ended, Tom Cruise bowed before the audience, thanking them for their love. He also shared a touching moment with director Christopher McQuarrie and greeted the rest of the cast.

            "title": "Modi's watershed war doctrine lurks well below Pakistan's N-threshold",
            "text": "At 8 pm on May 12, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation in a 22-minute speech that will define his legacy. Speaking over 72 hours after the IAF\u2019s devastating air strikes against Pakistan\u2019s terrorist and military infrastructure, the Prime Minister described how Operation Sindoor had established a new normal in India\u2019s fight against terrorism. \u201cIndia\u2019s drones and missiles attacked with precision,\u201d he said, \u201cdamaging Pakistani airbases and causing unimaginable damage in the first three days.\u201d PM Modi outlined a three-pronged strategy to tackle state-sponsored terrorism: a fitting response for every act of terror, no differentiation between state sponsors of terror and terrorists and, significantly, \u2018striking precisely at terrorist hideouts developing under the cover of nuclear blackmail.\u2019 Operation Sindoor, unprecedented in its scale, scope and audacity, has many firsts. India has signalled that it has seen through the Pakistan army\u2019s perfidy of using terrorists to strike at India. The strikes were triggered by the April 22 massacre of 26 tourists in Pahalgam, but given its scale, was a retaliation for over three decades of proxy war waged by the Pakistan Army against India -- from Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, to the streets of Mumbai -- relentlessly targeted by the Pakistan Army in three attacks between 1993 and 2008, which killed over 600 Mumbaikars. Operation Sindoor marks India\u2019s first tri-services cross-border counter-terror mission\u2014 the army struck from along the LoC, the air force pounding targets deep inside Pakistan and an Indian Navy carrier battle group positioned to strike from south of Karachi. These punitive strikes, which killed 100 terrorists, were undeterred by Pakistan\u2019s nuclear weapons arsenal. And this is why Operation Sindoor is a watershed -- one which will be studied by military strategists for decades. Nuclear-armed countries have militarily clashed only twice before. The Sino-Soviet border war of 1969 and the India-Pakistan war in Kargil, 1999. Both conflicts were confined to the border. The air forces of either side did not cross the border for fear of escalation. Both India and Pakistan who had fought three wars since 1947, tested nuclear weapons in 1998 to become overt nuclear weapon states. India\u2019s nuclear weapons programme is steered by its civilian Prime Ministers. In Pakistan, the military seized the N-weapons programme from the civilian government after General Zia\u2019s coup in 1976, five years after Pakistan\u2019s dismemberment in 1971. Pakistan\u2019s bomb was to ensure it did not suffer further loss of territory. But somewhere down the line, its nuclear weapons became an enabler of the terrorist proxies the Pakistan Army began rearing after the Afghan war of 1979-1988. Pakistan perfected this double-game during the US Global War on Terror (GWOT) which began after the 9/11 terror strikes which killed 2,977 people. Between 2001 and 2021, Pakistan befooled the US. The so-called frontline state in the GWOT was also sheltering the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, which were killing US soldiers in Afghanistan. With India, the duplicity was further refined. If India struck Pakistan using its larger military in response to a terror strike by its proxies, it would force it to use nuclear weapons, or so the Generals threatened. This bizarre Nuclear Weapons Enabled Terrorism (NWET) was emboldened in the face of India\u2019s limited retaliatory options to Pakistan\u2019s provocations. \u201cUnke paas bomb hain,\u201d (they have the bomb) a worried Vajpayee told Indian military brass in an Operation Parakram briefing. The Pakistan military escaped unpunished. Prime Minister Vajpayee weathered international opprobrium when he ordered Indian nuclear weapon tests on May 10, 1998. But the Pakistan army\u2019s NWET hydra was a beast even the great Vajpayee had no answer to. The answer came from the pylons of Indian Air Force fighter jets in the early hours of May 7, 2025. Dozens of precision-guided munitions spun out over the nighttime skies, hurtling towards pre-selected targets inside Pakistan. On the ground below, BrahMos missiles streaked at three times the speed of sound, death-diving into the Jaish-e-Mohammed\u2019s headquarters where Parliament attack mastermind Maulana Masood Azhar preached war against India. The IAF and Pakistan Air Force duelled in beyond-visual-range combat, blasting hundreds of beyond-visual range missiles at each other in the 21st century\u2019s largest single-day air battle. Forty-eight hours later Pakistan responded with a barrage of drone and ballistic missile attacks against Indian airbases, including at least one Fatah-2 ballistic missile fired at the Sirsa airbase in Haryana, 258 km from the national capital. A threshold had been crossed. A nuclear weapons state has never shot a ballistic missile at another N-weapon state, for fear this could be misconstrued as a nuclear weapons launch. This attack was casus belli for the IAF to begin Phase 3 of Operation Sindoor -- a ninety-minute predawn rampage on May 10. IAF aircraft blasted Pakistani airbases, installations and radars across a 1600-km distance from the high-altitude deserts of PoK to the Cholistan deserts of Sindh. PM Modi\u2019s May 12 statement made it clear that massive mobilisations like Op Parakram were a thing of the past. \u201cPakistan had prepared for an attack on the border, but India struck at the heart of Pakistan,\u201d he said. Indian officials say the May 10 strikes by the IAF damaged 20% of the PAF\u2019s infrastructure and killed 50 personnel forced the PAF to withdraw to its rear bases and activate its wartime contingencies of operating from highways. The Pakistan military\u2019s accountants would be totalling the losses to military infrastructure over the last 72 hours. The losses to its military infrastructure would possibly be more than the $1 billion (8,500 crore Indian rupees or 28,000 crore Pakistani rupees) IMF loan disbursed to Islamabad on May 9. GHQ Rawalpindi pursued terrorism as a low-cost option to bleed India. It is now faced with the highest one-week cost since 1971. The Pakistan Army will have to carefully weigh the costs of NWET, particularly since the Indian response was well below Pakistan\u2019s nuclear threshold, the four red lines enunciated by then chief of its Strategic Plans Division (SPD), Lt General Khalid Kidwai in 2001. Pakistan would nuke India if it lost territory, was internally destabilised, economically blockaded or lost its war machinery. Prime Minister Modi has shown a greater understanding of these red lines than his predecessors. His actions since 2016 have explored the space below the threshold to punish Pakistan\u2019s sponsorship of terror. He has expanded the punitive military option in scale over the past decade. From shallow cross-border raids by Indian Army special forces commandos in 2016 to a single strike by the IAF on February 26, 2019. Operation Sindoor is a whole different ball game. It opens up a new \u2018tri-services escalation ladder mechanism\u2019 as mentioned by DG Naval Operations Vice Admiral AN Pramod in the May 11 briefing. The ball is now firmly at the door of Pakistan\u2019s Generals in GHQ Rawalpindi. The Generals, who have stealthily usurped all power from behind the curtains, can choose to focus on building up their battered economy, improving the lives of its wretched populace, or use terrorists and risk the wrath of further punitive strikes. But the leopard-like Generals are unlikely to change their spots."

            "title": "Indian Test team after Rohit, Virat: A peek into the future",
            "text": "The two modern-day guardians of Indian cricket \u2013 Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli \u2013 have retired from two out of the three formats of international cricket. Between the two, India have scored 21,950 runs in T20I and Test cricket, and have also featured in six finals in ICC tournaments. Rohit and Kohli's departures feel bittersweet. Together, they broke India's ICC trophy jinx, winning the T20 World Cup 2024 and Champions Trophy 2025, and before that in 2023, they played one of the most dominating campaigns in the history of the ODI World Cup, albeit missing out on the trophy. While they retired from the T20I format on a high, leaving the Indian team an ample amount of time to prepare for the next tournament, their Test retirements came when they were at their all-time low. India are set to play a five-match Test series against England between June and August, which will also usher in the new World Test Championship cycle. It is imperative for the two-time WTC finalists to start well, given the confidence of the Test team is at an all-time low after their losses against New Zealand and Australia. The Indian management has to fill three holes in the playing XI for the England side: the opening slot left vacant by Rohit Sharma, the crucial No. 4 spot left by Virat Kohli, and the lead spinner\u2019s spot left by Ravichandran Ashwin. The Ashwin vacancy will not bother India in England, given the team does not play an out-and-out spinner in those conditions. Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, or Axar Patel are more than capable spinners for those conditions, who can also give a fine output with the bat. Here\u2019s a look at what India\u2019s squad could look like in the absence of the three stalwarts of the Indian cricket team. The last time India played in England (2021/22), Rohit Sharma was a beast of a Test batter. 345 runs in four Tests at an average of 57.50 \u2013 this was a very different kind of Rohit Sharma, seen in the past two years. Rohit\u2019s signature style was to dent the new ball by defending everything, and then unleashing on the fast bowlers. India would ideally need Rohit\u2019s assurance at the top, and the man perhaps best fit for that role is KL Rahul. Rahul was Rohit\u2019s partner in 2021, scoring 315 runs from four matches, after being shoehorned in, in place of Mayank Agarwal. KL Rahul has been moved across the batting line-up in the last few years, and he has done it without any complaints. In the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Down Under, Rahul looked like the only batter apart from Yashasvi Jaiswal who had the confidence to score runs. It is perhaps time that India settled him in one position in the next two-and-a-half-year cycle. Very few batters in world cricket brought in confidence at No. 4 as Virat Kohli. In his 14-year Test career, there were times that Virat Kohli looked invincible with the blade in his hand. One can argue that Virat sacrificed many of his Test runs in the hunt for wins in the Indian subcontinent, making pitches that were friendlier towards bowlers. \"I don't mind compromising on (batsmen's) averages as long as we are winning Test matches,\" Kohli had said in 2015 after a match against South Africa at home. If one wants the swagger of Virat Kohli back at No. 4, they should not look beyond Shubman Gill. His short-arm jab, his ability to drive the ball at will \u2013 Shubman is an elite batter. Shubman transitioned from opening to No. 3 in 2022, and it is perhaps time that he settled into No. 4, where the most important batter in any Test team plays. In case India give Shubman the No. 4 position, the team will have to find someone steady at No. 3. It would be highly recommended that they do not look at KL Rahul once again, who has been moved in and out of positions. India have choices at their hands \u2013 if they want someone dynamic, Sai Sudharsan is their man. If they want someone with defensive capabilities, they have Karun Nair at their hands, who just played out a record-breaking season in the Ranji Trophy. If they want someone with grit and the ability to bite down in hard circumstances, maybe they can audition Sarfaraz Khan. And this is where Rohit Sharma\u2019s \u2018garden me ghoomne vaale\u2019 kids come into play. They will have to step up big time in the England series, because that essentially sets the tone for what\u2019s to come. If India win in England, Gautam Gambhir gets a fresh slate, free of any baggage from Australia, because this will be his team \u2013 a team that he himself has designed. But if India lose in England, the panic would set in once again, and Gambhir might also lose his job, in the Test format at least."

You showed rare composure \u2013 maintaining both passion and wisdom.\u201d Taking a strong stance on terrorism, the Defence Minister said, \u201cIndia\u2019s resolve against terrorism is so firm that we have not even cared about nuclear blackmail. The world has seen how irresponsibly Pakistan has issued nuclear threats to India multiple times. From the soil of Srinagar, I want to ask the world: Are nuclear weapons safe in the hands of such an irresponsible rogue nation? I believe Pakistan\u2019s nuclear weapons should be brought under IAEA supervision.\u201d Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has clearly redefined India\u2019s policy against terrorism, declaring any terrorist attack on Indian soil an act of war. He added that the current understanding between the two countries is based on preventing any cross-border aggression. The Union Minister emphasised that if such actions occur, the consequences will be severe. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh emphasised India\u2019s firm stance against terrorism, saying that India has not been deterred by nuclear blackmail. He highlighted how the world has witnessed Pakistan\u2019s irresponsible nuclear threats towards India multiple times. Speaking from Srinagar, Singh questioned the safety of nuclear weapons in the hands of such a rogue nation. He urged that Pakistan\u2019s nuclear arsenal should be brought under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Defence Minister Rajnath Singh paid tribute to all the innocent civilians killed in the recent terrorist attack in Pahalgam. He also honoured the soldiers who attained martyrdom during \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019 and saluted the bravery of the injured soldiers.

            "text": "Can we say there\u2019s finally a clear timeline for the much-delayed Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake? If you are unaware, Ubisoft has confirmed that The Sands of Time remake will arrive by the end of March 2026. This means the title is expected to launch sometime during Ubisoft\u2019s 2025-26 financial year. While that\u2019s still a while away, it\u2019s at least a concrete window \u2014 especially after years of silence, delays and developmental troubles. To give a little recap, the remake was originally announced in 2020, and since then, it has had a rocky journey so far, including fan backlash to its first trailer, developer changes, and the game essentially going back to the drawing board. The latest update came during Ubisoft\u2019s earnings report for the 2024-25 fiscal year, where it outlined its plans for the next year and confirmed the Sands of Time remake as part of its upcoming line-up. Alongside the remake, Ubisoft also revealed titles such as Anno 117: Pax Romana, Rainbow Six Mobile, and The Division Resurgence are all targeting the same launch window. But we are here to talk about the Sands of Time remake. While Ubisoft had previously mentioned a vague 2026 timeline, this new statement helps narrow it down to a January-March release. Of course, that is assuming there are no further delays \u2014 something fans will be understandably wary of given how long the project has already taken. For those who\u2019ve been following the game, the journey has been anything but smooth. The original remake was in development at Ubisoft\u2019s India-based studios in Mumbai and Pune, but following criticism over poor visuals and a general lack of polish, Ubisoft shifted the project to its Montreal and Toronto teams. This transition brought a major overhaul, with the game reportedly being rebuilt from the ground up, including fresh animations, combat mechanics, and a complete visual makeover. Insiders familiar with the project have also hinted at a more authentic take on the setting. This includes casting a new actor of Persian origin for the Prince\u2019s role, replacing Yuri Lowenthal, who voiced the character in the original trilogy. Despite the delays, Ubisoft appears committed to delivering a better version of the game than what fans first saw. The success of Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown earlier this year has likely helped boost internal confidence, reminding Ubisoft that there is still strong interest in the franchise. As a fan myself, I am now only waiting for when Ubisoft decides to show the game again. A re-reveal trailer is expected any time now, considering we are less than a year away from the expected release. Stay tuned to India Today Tech for all the latest on the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake."

(Image: Google Maps) The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has clarified that there was no radiation leak from any nuclear facility in Pakistan during the hostilities with India last week. Over the past few days, social media have been abuzz with speculation about a possible nuclear leak at Pakistan's Kirana Hills, which is believed to be a storage facility for nuclear warheads in Sargodha district. In an exclusive interview with India Today, Fredrik Dahl, spokesperson of the global nuclear watchdog, said, \"Based on information available to the IAEA, there has been no radiation leak or release from any nuclear facility in Pakistan.\" Previously, both India and Pakistan have rejected claims about the nuclear facility at Kirana Hills being hit during India's missile attacks. The Sargodha airbase was among the 11 military sites in Pakistan that were targeted by India after Islamabad launched a wave of drone strikes."

            "text": "Google has all but confirmed that its long-anticipated Android smart glasses will take centre stage at the upcoming I/O 2025. This developer conference is scheduled for 20 May. The tech giant gave a clue about its smart glasses during the livestream of The Android Show: I/O Edition, where Sameer Samat, President of Android Ecosystem, ended the broadcast by slipping on a futuristic-looking headset, teasing \u201ca few more really cool Android demos\u201d for the big day. Now, the concept of getting smart glasses from Google is not new. The tech giant has flirted with the idea of smart glasses before, with one of the most notable being Google Glass. However, this device didn\u2019t work out well for the company and was eventually discontinued. We can say the Google Glass was not very refined and was too wacky. In fact, the concept was also too early to make its way into the market. But now, particularly after success of the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, Google feels that it needs to enter the arena again. Google had earlier shown the prototype of the Android smart glasses multiple times. At the TED 2025 \u201cHumanity Reimagined\u201d event in Vancouver, the company showcased a working prototype of its Android XR glasses. Unlike earlier efforts, these new glasses closely resemble ordinary eyewear \u2014 like Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban \u2014 but come equipped with a suite of advanced features powered by Gemini, Google\u2019s generative AI. The prototype also showcased features like real-time transcription, translation, and even a memory function. This feature uses the onboard camera and AI to keep track of what the user is seeing \u2014 such as helping them recall where they last left their keys. Google even demonstrated how the prototype can record real-time conversations and perform visual recognition. Looking at it, the Android smart glasses seem far more refined and smarter than Google Glass. Another feature which looks promising is a built-in display. However, according to reports, the final product expected to debut at I/O might not include one. According to reports from South Korea's ETNews, Google is collaborating with Samsung on a separate smart glasses initiative codenamed \u201cHaean.\u201d While these smart glasses are still in the production stage, they are rumoured to arrive as a direct competitor to Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban smart glasses cost Rs 29,900 in India and feature an ultra-wide 12-megapixel camera to capture photos and videos.

The company has confirmed that the new smartphone, the iQOO Neo 10, will be officially launched in India on May 26. In the lead up to the launch, the company has been teasing a few details about the device, but a recent leak claims to reveal one of the most critical pieces of information about the phone \u2013 the pricing. Leaks suggest that the iQOO Neo 10 will be priced in India between the range of Rs 33,000 and Rs 35,000. Reportedly, the pricing of the phone may actually be higher, but it will be launched along with bank offers, which will bring its effective price down to Rs 35,000. This makes sense considering the iQOO Neo 10R (review), which is supposed to be a somewhat lighter version of the Neo 10, was launched earlier this year at a selling price of Rs 26,999, and the pricing of the highest variant currently goes up to Rs 30,999 (offers included). With its pricing being set at around Rs 35,000, the iQOO Neo 10 will be able to set its own price territory, without being too expensive. Ahead of the launch, a lot of details about the iQOO Neo 10 have already been confirmed. For instance, the company has already confirmed that the smartphone will be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 processor, and it will use a Vivo Q1 chip for camera processing. Supporting the system-on-chip will be LPPDDR5x RAM and UFS4.1 storage. The exact specifications for the RAM and storage are yet to be revealed. Additionally, the iQOO Neo 10 is confirmed to sport an AMOLED display with 1.5K resolution, a whopping 5,500nits of peak brightness and a refresh rate up to 144Hz. The size of the display has not been revealed but it will likely be larger than 6.5-inch. For perspective, the iQOO Neo 10R features a 6.78-inch AMOLED display, with similar display specifications with the exception of its support for 4,500nits peak brightness. iQOO also says that the iQOO Neo 10 will support 144FPS gaming, and will offer 3,000Hz touch sampling rate. One of the highlights of the smartphone will be its battery. iQOO has confirmed that the Neo 10 will come with a huge 7,000mAh battery, with support for 120W fast charging (wired). The company claims that the fast-charging tech will allow users to charge the phone from zero to 50 per cent in 15 minutes. For photography, the iQOO Neo 10 will sport a dual-camera setup on the rear, which will include a 50-megapixel Sony image sensor on the primary camera. For selfies, the phone is confirmed to come with a 32-megapixel camera.

(Photo: GettyImages) Indian mutual funds turned buyers in the IT sector this April, even as foreign investors pulled out large sums. This came during a time of uncertainty caused by weak earnings and concerns over US growth due to tariff issues. According to Primedatabase data, mutual funds invested over Rs 9,599 crore in IT shares during the month. In contrast, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold more than Rs 15,000 crore worth of tech stocks, as per NSDL data. Unlike FIIs, mutual funds release detailed monthly reports showing exactly where they\u2019ve put their money. This gives a clearer picture of stock-wise investments. Among IT companies, Infosys saw the highest interest from mutual funds, with fresh investments of Rs 3,011 crore. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Coforge followed, receiving Rs 2,375 crore and Rs 1,432 crore, respectively. Other major names that drew investment included HCL Technologies, Persistent Systems, Mphasis, LTIMindtree, Hexaware, and Cyient, with amounts ranging from Rs 170 crore to Rs 960 crore. However, mutual funds did sell shares of some tech firms. They reduced their holdings in Tech Mahindra by Rs 270 crore and also cut down on Birlasoft and Zaggle Prepaid, selling more than Rs 85 crore each. Smaller cuts were made in Oracle Financial Services, Affle, Neweb Technologies, and Inventurus Knowledge Solutions. Meanwhile, both mutual funds and FIIs put money into financial stocks. MFs invested Rs 4,450 crore in this space, while FIIs were even more bullish, pouring in Rs 18,409 crore. Kotak Mahindra Bank attracted the highest MF investment in the financial sector, with Rs 1,586 crore. IDFC First Bank and HDFC Bank followed, drawing Rs 1,150 crore and Rs 1,026 crore. Other financial names that saw increased MF holdings included Max Financial Services, Axis Bank, HDFC Life, RBL Bank, and Shriram Finance. On the other hand, mutual funds pulled money out of the telecom and FMCG sectors. They sold Rs 2,787 crore worth of telecom shares and Rs 2,211 crore in FMCG stocks. Interestingly, FIIs did the opposite, buying Rs 4,648 crore worth of telecom shares and Rs 2,917 crore in FMCG. Bharti Airtel saw the biggest MF exit in telecom, with Rs 2,499 crore worth of shares sold. Indus Towers and Bharti Hexacom followed with sell-offs of Rs 584 crore and Rs 173 crore. In FMCG, the biggest drop came in ITC, where MFs reduced holdings by Rs 2,779 crore. HUL and Marico also faced selling of Rs 596 crore and Rs 382 crore. Other FMCG companies that saw mutual fund exits included Nestle India, Tata Consumer Products, United Spirits, and Avanti Feeds."

            "title": "Google DeepMind brings AlphaEvolve tuned to tackle maths and computing problems",
            "text": "Google DeepMind launches AlphaEvolve Ahead of the Google I/O 2025 annual developer conference, starting May 20, Google has announced its new AI agent called AlphaEvolve. The company introduces the AI agent as \"an evolutionary coding agent powered by large language models for general-purpose algorithm discovery and optimisation.\" It explains that AlphaEvolve combines the inventive problem-solving strengths of Google\u2019s Gemini models with automated evaluators that validate solutions, employing an evolutionary system to refine and build on the most promising concepts. Let's delve deeper into Google's latest AI agent -- AlphaEvolve. Google DeepMind has unveiled AlphaEvolve, a powerful new tool designed to tackle complex coding challenges by harnessing the strengths of its Gemini 2.0 large language models (LLMs). While LLMs are often hit-or-miss when it comes to generating code, AlphaEvolve takes a different approach. It continuously refines its output by scoring each of Gemini\u2019s suggestions, discarding weaker attempts and iteratively improving the stronger ones. This evolutionary process enables the system to produce highly optimised algorithms, many of which outperform the best human-written alternatives in terms of speed or accuracy. One standout example of AlphaEvolve\u2019s capabilities, as shared by the company, is its role in improving Google\u2019s job scheduling software, which allocates computing tasks across millions of servers worldwide. According to DeepMind, the refined algorithm has been running in production across Google\u2019s global data centres for over a year, unlocking a 0.7 per cent gain in computing efficiency\u2014a modest-sounding figure, but a massive boost at Google\u2019s scale. AlphaEvolve also addresses one of the major pitfalls of modern AI: hallucinations. Most AI systems, due to their probabilistic nature, sometimes fabricate confident but false answers. In fact, newer models, including OpenAI\u2019s o3, have demonstrated an increased tendency to do so. To combat this, AlphaEvolve introduces an automated evaluation layer. It prompts the model to generate multiple potential answers, then critiques and scores them based on accuracy, effectively filtering out unreliable responses. Google DeepMind in its blogpost stated, \"AlphaEvolve verifies, runs and scores the proposed programs using automated evaluation metrics. These metrics provide an objective, quantifiable assessment of each solution\u2019s accuracy and quality. This makes AlphaEvolve particularly helpful in a broad range of domains where progress can be clearly and systematically measured, like in math and computer science.\" Using AlphaEvolve involves presenting it with a clearly defined problem\u2014this could include technical instructions, mathematical equations, code examples, or academic references. Crucially, the user must also supply a method for automatically assessing the output, typically via a formula or test mechanism. As such, AlphaEvolve is best suited to domains where self-verification is possible, like computing and systems optimisation. However, the system is not without its limitations. AlphaEvolve can only tackle problems it can evaluate on its own, and it exclusively produces algorithmic solutions. This means it's less effective\u2014or entirely unsuitable\u2014for tackling open-ended, qualitative, or non-numerical problems.

(Photo: Nasa) Nasa's Magellan mission launched in 1989 has now revealed unknown facts about Venus, which is also dubbed as Earth's mysterious twin. Researchers discovered, hidden in the archival data, new evidence that tectonic activity may be deforming the Venus\u2019s surface. This is another similarity the planet could be sharing with Earth, which is continually renewed by the constant shifting and recycling of massive sections of crust, called tectonic plates, that float atop a viscous interior. Researchers studied a type of feature called a corona that ranges in size from dozens to hundreds of miles across. Nasa said that corona is most often thought to be the location where a plume of hot, buoyant material from the planet\u2019s mantle rises, pushing against the lithosphere above. These structures are usually oval, with a concentric fracture system surrounding them. Hundreds of coronae are known to exist on Venus. The details, published in the journal Science Advances, reveal the evidence of this tectonic activity within data from NASA\u2019s Magellan mission, which orbited Venus in the 1990s and gathered the most detailed gravity and topography data on the planet currently available. \u201cCoronae are not found on Earth today; however, they may have existed when our planet was young and before plate tectonics had been established. By combining gravity and topography data, this research has provided a new and important insight into the possible subsurface processes currently shaping the surface of Venus,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author, Gael Cascioli said. The spacecraft used its radar system to see through Venus\u2019 thick atmosphere and map the topography of its mountains and plains. Researchers found a number of coronae on Venus. \"The most exciting thing for our study is that we can now say there are most likely various and ongoing active processes driving their formation. We believe these same processes may have occurred early in Earth\u2019s history,\u201d coauthor Anna Glcher added. This work marks the latest instance of scientists returning to Magellan data to find that Venus exhibits geologic processes that are more Earth-like than originally thought."

Where are the ingredients of the offence?\u201d Observing that the FIR lacked any material that could constitute a cognisable offence, the court remarked that it had been \u201cdrafted in such a way that it can be quashed.\u201d The bench added, \u201cThere is nothing in the FIR.\u201d In the interest of justice, the High Court said the investigation shall be closely monitored. \u201cThe FIR is to be amended to include the entirety of the High Court's earlier order in Para 12 \u2014 all details of actions by Vijay Shah are to be mentioned clearly.\" The court reiterated, \u201cThere has to be a cognisable offence,\u201d and asked, \u201cWhere are the contents of those offences?\u201d It further said, \u201cThis FIR can easily be quashed.\u201d When the counsel admitted to not drafting the FIR, the court retorted, \u201cObviously you have not drafted it!\u201d The counsel submitted that the entire High Court order had been attached to the FIR, to which the court said, \u201cIt was registered last night but the content must be there in the FIR. If you have annexed the order, it will be read as part of the FIR.\u201d Responding to the court's observations, the Advocate General said, \u201cWe will act as the court directs, while the counsel requested the bench not to assume that they were protecting the accused. The court, however, remarked, \u201cThe intention is apparent from the act. The act shows that the contents of the FIR are not there.\u201d The minister had approached the Supreme Court for relief a day after the Madhya Pradesh High Court ordered an FIR against him for \u201chate speech\u201d against Army\u2019s Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, A case has also been registered against Shah in Indore under relevant sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). The case was registered in compliance with a high court order, which called the minister's remarks \"disparaging and dangerous\". This came despite Vijay Shah issuing an unconditional apology for his remarks, which sparked nationwide outrage and drew flak from all quarters. \"I am not only ashamed and saddened by my statement but sincerely apologise from the bottom of my heart,\" Vijay Shah said in a video statement. The development came a day after Shah, while speaking at a government event, had said that the Prime Minister had sent a \"sister from the same community\" as those in Pakistan to avenge the April 22 terror attack in Kashmir\u2019s Pahalgam. \"Modi ji is striving for society. Those who widowed our daughters [in Pahalgam], we sent a sister of their own to teach them a lesson,\" he said."

            "text": "A sudden spike in dust pollution since last night has blanketed Delhi and its surrounding regions in a thick layer of dust, severely affecting visibility and deteriorating the air quality. The Air Quality Index (AQI) has breached the 200-mark, entering the \u2018poor\u2019 category, raising serious health concerns. Data from multiple pollution observation centres in the capital show PM10 and PM2.5 levels soaring to nearly 20 times the normal limits. These fine particulate matters are considered hazardous to human health, especially for individuals with respiratory conditions. Post-midnight, the wind speed dropped significantly to around 3\u20137 km/h, allowing the dust to linger in the atmosphere. As a result, visibility has remained low, fluctuating between 1,200 and 1,500 meters. This sharp decline in visibility not only poses a risk to road traffic but also poses a serious threat to those suffering from respiratory ailments such as asthma and bronchitis. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) explained the cause behind this sudden environmental shift. According to the IMD, strong, dust-laden winds blew across the Palam area near IGI Airport between 10:00 PM and 11:30 PM, reducing visibility drastically from 4,500 meters to just 1,200 meters. Wind speeds during this period reached 30\u201340 km/h, contributing to the swift dispersal of dust particles across the region. In a surprising development, several monitoring stations have stopped displaying PM10 readings, sparking questions about their reliability. In a slight reprieve, the IMD reported that this morning, westerly winds at 10 km/h helped improve visibility in the Palam area from 1,300 meters to 1,500 meters. The weather department expects a gradual decline in pollution levels over the coming days."

The top court also passed a directive to all states and union territories to probe if any forest land was allotted to any private parties for non-forest activities. \"Chief secretaries to ensure that all land with state governments and union territories which are forest land be handed over to the forest department. If the land has become non-forest by conversion, then let an adequate amount be calculated for afforestation,\" observed the Supreme Court. \"Reserved forest land cannot be assigned by lease by state authorities to any person/entity without prior approval of the centre,\" the bench added. The case pertains to the allotment of 11.86 acres of forest land in Pune's Kondhwa Budruk by the Maharasthra revenue department to Richie Rich Colony -- despite resistance from the forest department. The Court said that the environmental clearance given to the Richie Rich Colony was illegal."

(Satellite image \u00a92025 Maxar Technologies) India demonstrated a decisive advantage over Pakistan in targeting high-value military assets during their recent four-day confrontation, according to a detailed New York Times report supported by high-resolution satellite imagery. Described as the most intense military engagement between the two nuclear-armed nations in over five decades, the flare-up that started after India's Operation Sindoor saw both sides unleash drones and precision-guided missiles. However, as per the NYT analysis, India\u2019s strikes were significantly more effective and better targeted. \"Where India appears to have had a clear edge is in its targeting of Pakistan's military facilities and airfields, as the latter stretch of fighting shifted from symbolic strikes and shows of force to attacks on each other's defence capabilities,\u201d the report added. Even more notable, according to the NYT, was India\u2019s successful strike on the Nur Khan Air Base, \u201cperhaps the most sensitive military target that India struck.\u201d The base is near Pakistan\u2019s army headquarters and is close to the country's nuclear command infrastructure. India also targeted key airfields across Pakistan, including runway sections at the Rahim Yar Khan and Sargodha bases. Satellite images supported these claims, showing the affected infrastructure. On May 10, Pakistan itself issued a notice confirming that the Rahim Yar Khan runway was non-operational. In contrast, Pakistan\u2019s claims of striking key Indian bases, including the Udhampur airbase, were not substantiated by satellite evidence. Imagery from May 12 showed no visible damage at the site, raising doubts about the effectiveness of Pakistan\u2019s retaliatory strikes. Pakistan also claimed damage to the critical Adampur airbase in Punjab, which was also debunked by India and even more when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the site on Tuesday. Earlier, on May 7, India launched Operation Sindoor and destroyed nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The operation came in response to the deadly terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam, which left 26 people dead. India and Pakistan subsequently agreed to a ceasefire understanding on May 10 following four days of intense military exchanges targeting each other\u2019s installations."

(Photo: Axiom Space) The highly anticipated launch of Indian astronaut Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla to the International Space Station (ISS) has been postponed. The postponement comes amid the backdrop of a major escalation in tensions between Indian and Pakistan that led to the Indian Air Force calling back one of the astronauts part of the Gaganyaan Mission o his unity. This has led to concern if Shubhanshu Shukla's launch was postponed due to this. Instead, the delay comes after a minor technical issue was discovered during pre-launch checks, as confirmed by officials from Axiom Space and NASA. Originally scheduled for May 29, Shukla\u2019s historic flight as part of the Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4) crew will now lift off on June 8, 2025, from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The mission will use SpaceX\u2019s Dragon spacecraft atop a Falcon 9 rocket, carrying Shukla and three international crewmates: mission commander Peggy Whitson (USA), Sawosz Uznaski-Winiewski (Poland), and Tibor Kapu (Hungary). Shukla, serving as mission pilot, is set to become the first Indian to visit the ISS and only the second Indian in space since Rakesh Sharma\u2019s 1984 flight. Axiom Space and NASA cited the need to review the ISS flight schedule and ensure operational readiness for several upcoming missions as the reason for the postponement. During the Ax-4 mission, expected to last up to 14 days, Shukla will conduct a series of scientific experiments, including studies on muscle loss, microgravity adaptation, and bio-farming. These experiments are closely tied to India\u2019s Gaganyaan human spaceflight programme, with findings expected to inform future missions."

In an interview with ANI, Rubin credited India\u2019s swift and precise military retaliation \u2014 dubbed Operation Sindoor \u2014 for shifting global focus to Pakistan\u2019s role in cross-border terrorism and undermining Islamabad\u2019s long-standing narrative. \u201cIndia won this both diplomatically and militarily,\u201d Rubin said. \u201cThe reason why India won diplomatically is that all attention is now on Pakistan's terrorist sponsorship.\u201d What followed was a brief but intense period of Pakistani retaliation that India effectively countered by also striking Pakistani airbases. Rubin emphasised how the operation exposed the links between Pakistan\u2019s military and terrorist groups. \u201cThe fact that Pakistani officers in uniform attended the funeral of terrorists shows there is no differentiation between a terrorist and a member of the ISI or the Pakistani armed forces,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world is going to demand that Pakistan extract the rot from its own system.\u201d Rubin painted a scathing picture of Pakistan\u2019s battlefield performance. \u201cMilitarily, Pakistan is shocked... Pakistan has started every single war with India and yet convinced itself that somehow it has won,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult for Pakistan to convince itself that it won this 4-day war.\u201d He described Pakistan\u2019s military response as disorganised and ineffective. \u201cIslamabad went running to try to achieve a ceasefire like a scared dog with its tail between its legs,\u201d Rubin told ANI, adding, \u201cThere is absolutely no spin that the Pakistani military can put on what occurred... they not only lost, they lost very, very badly.\u201d Rubin acknowledged that the United States often engages in quiet diplomacy during Indo-Pakistani tensions, especially to prevent escalation. \u201cThe United States is trying diplomatically to provide an off-ramp to prevent unrestricted warfare and also, in a worst-case scenario, prevent an escalation to any sort of nuclear exchange,\u201d he noted. On US President Donald Trump\u2019s past claims of mediating between India and Pakistan, Rubin said with sarcasm, \u201cDonald Trump likes to claim credit for everything.

Tharoor\u2019s remarks, which diverged from the Congress's official stand, became a flashpoint during a closed-door party meeting held to discuss US President Donald Trump\u2019s claim of mediating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. Tharoor has been vocal about his praise of government\u2019s Operation Sindoor, calling India\u2019s air strikes on terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir \"calibrated\" and \"very, very calculated.\" He also offered a strong rejoinder over Trump\u2019s claims of trying to portray India-Pakisitan mediation as a US-led de-escalation Sources said Tharoor was pulled up for his statements that questioned aspects of Trump\u2019s assertion\u2014something the party has raised as an issue against the ruling BJP government. Sources said Congress leader Jairam Ramesh directly confronted Tharoor, asking why he had gone off-script. There was enough democracy in the party and everyone had the freedom to speak, but Tharoor had crossed the Lakshman rekha this time, a Congress leader said on condition of anonymity. Another source said that Tharoor defended his stance and pointed to the upcoming Parliamentary Standing Committee meeting on External Affairs scheduled for May 19, where Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri has been summoned. Later, when asked at a press conference whether Tharoor\u2019s views aligned with the party line, the Congress distanced itself. \u201cWhat Shashi Tharoor says is his personal opinion. He speaks for himself and not for the Congress party,\u201d said Jairam Ramesh. On Monday, Tharoor lashed out at Trump\u2019s claim that his administration helped de-escalate tensions between India and Pakistan, calling the remarks \u201cdisappointing\u201d for India. He said Trump\u2019s assertion \u201coffers Pakistan a negotiating framework which it certainly has not earned,\u201d and declared, \u201cIndia will never negotiate with a terrorist gun pointed at its head.\u201d Tharoor also warned that Trump\u2019s framing of events \u201cinternationalises\u201d the Kashmir issue\u2014something India has consistently rejected\u2014and \u201cre-hyphenates\u201d India and Pakistan in global discourse.

            "text": "Blake Lively has reportedly threatened her best friend, pop superstar Taylor Swift, with the release of private text messages unless Swift publicly supports her claims against co-star Justin Baldoni, according to a new court filing. Swift\u2019s legal team is now working to keep her distance from the escalating legal battle. Legal documents obtained by Page Six reveal that Lively\u2019s attorney, Michael Gottlieb of Willkie Farr, allegedly contacted Swift\u2019s legal representatives with a demand. The filing claims that Gottlieb urged Swift to issue a public statement in support of Lively, implying that failure to do so would result in the release of personal and private text messages in Lively\u2019s possession. However, Gottlieb has strongly denied these allegations. In a statement on behalf of Lively\u2019s team, he said: \"We unequivocally deny all of these so-called allegations, which are cowardly sourced to supposed anonymous individuals and are completely untethered from reality. Justin Baldoni's team is attempting to cause damage without any supporting evidence.\" Baldoni\u2019s production company, Wayfarer Studios, maintains that they received the information from a highly credible source. The actor also alleged that Lively had asked Swift to delete their message history. According to Baldoni's legal team, Swift\u2019s attorney responded in writing, calling the alleged threat \"inappropriate\" and \"extortionate,\" and requested that Lively\u2019s team cease all such communications. Baldoni\u2019s lawyers are now pushing for access to the private exchanges, claiming that Swift is a key witness in the case. While the specific contents of the messages remain unclear, the documents note that Lively allegedly compared Swift and her husband to Game of Thrones characters while suggesting creative changes to a rooftop scene in 'It Ends With Us'. Swift\u2019s team has previously denied any involvement in the film or the ongoing dispute, aside from granting permission for her song My Tears Ricochet to be used in the movie. The controversy stems from a lawsuit filed in December 2024, in which Blake Lively accused Justin Baldoni of sexual harassment, along with additional abuse claims and allegations of a targeted smear campaign."

On May 7, India launched Operation Sindoor and struck nine terror bases in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Muridke was one of the sites that was targeted during the operation. The main targets of the strikes were the jihadist structures of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Toiba, the two terrorist organisations responsible for major attacks on Indian soil over the past three decades. Located about 33 km from Lahore on the historic Grand Trunk Road, Muridke hosts the headquarters of the Lashkar-e-Toiba. Called the Markaz-e-Toiba, the LeT headquarter operates under the facade of a charitable organisation, Jammat-ud_Dawa. It is said to be spread over 200 acres of land, making it one of the largest terror facilities in not just Pakistan but across the world."

            "title": "Endometriosis can start as early as age 10: Here's why that matters",
            "text": "The average delay in diagnosing endometriosis is 7 to 10 years globally. (Photo: Getty Images) Endometriosis, a disease too commonly misunderstood as a problem only in adult women, can start much earlier, sometimes at 10 or 12 years of age. This condition happens when the tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. It depends on the female hormone called estrogen, according to Dr. Smeet Patel, Endometriosis Specialist, Mayflower Women\u2019s Hospital, Ahmedabad. Since estrogen secretion starts at around the time of menarche (the onset of the first period in a girl), endometriosis can arise precisely at the time of puberty onset. This phase of a young girl's life is characterised by a burst of hormonal activity, causing significant physical, emotional, and psychological changes. The body begins to prepare for menstruation even before the onset of the first period by secreting hormones, which can lead to fluctuations and imbalances. These hormonal changes are frequently accompanied by pain or discomfort, but not all pain should be ignored as normal. Endometriosis can manifest with symptoms like pelvic pain, painful menstruation, gastrointestinal discomfort, fatigue, or low energy. Mild discomfort during the initial few cycles is usual, but severe pain lasting more than six months or affecting daily life might be a cause for concern. A 2021 study published in the Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology found that over 60% of women with endometriosis reported experiencing symptoms during adolescence, but diagnosis was often delayed by years. The catch? Even imaging tests such as ultrasounds and MRIs may reveal normal readings, particularly with early-stage disease. This typically results in delayed diagnosis, where pain is normalised or ignored. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the average delay in diagnosing endometriosis is 7 to 10 years globally, which often means that crucial years for early intervention and support are lost. Two widely debated hypotheses describe how endometriosis could develop. One is retrograde menstruation, whereby menstrual blood flows backwards through the fallopian tubes and into the pelvic cavity and permits endometrial cells to implant and become established outside the uterus. The second is the embryonic Mullerian cell theory, which suggests that during fetal development, some Mullerian cells fail to leave the body as they normally should. Instead, they remain and later develop into tissue similar to the lining of the uterus (endometrium). Both of these hypotheses predict that endometriosis may become apparent at an early age. Early detection is important, not just to treat the pain but also to halt the progression of disease and preserve fertility. The Endometriosis UK charity reports that delayed diagnosis is one of the top contributors to poor quality of life and increased mental health issues among patients. Certain girls are enduring a lot of pain during their periods. For the first 2\u20133 years, if there is immense pain, then it may possibly be something that needs to be checked,\" said Dr. Patel. A gynecologist can help determine if symptoms arise due to puberty, endometriosis, or other health conditions such as PCOS. PCOS, OBESITY, AND OTHER HORMONAL RED FLAGS IN TEENS Notably, early symptoms of PCOS and obesity-induced hormonal problems can also appear during adolescence. With timely intervention, by way of lifestyle modifications such as exercise or diet changes, these can often be reversed. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, lifestyle changes during adolescence can significantly improve symptoms in both PCOS and early-stage endometriosis. Routine check-ups provide young girls with the necessary advice, not only on coping with symptoms, but also on menstrual hygiene, identifying abnormal patterns, and even on preventive treatments such as the HPV vaccine. Education and early screening can bridge the diagnostic gap that so many girls currently fall through. Adolescence is a defining moment for reproductive health. Educating girls about conditions like endometriosis and encouraging early medical help empowers them to understand their bodies, seek timely care, and take charge of their future."

The operation targeted nine bases, including Lashkar-e-Taiba headquarters at Muridke. India has launched Operation Sindoor, targeting 9 terror locations in Pakistan, including Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad headquarters. The strikes hit targets in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Punjab province, using Rafale jets, missiles, and drones. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri stated the response was swift and proportionate, while warning of further action if Pakistan retaliates or escalates. India has conducted unprecedented strikes on multiple terror targets deep inside Pakistan, including in Punjab province, in an operation dubbed 'Sindoor'. The strikes hit 9 terror camps using various air and ground-based assets. Military experts describe it as a well-planned, calibrated joint operation that has exposed weaknesses in Pakistan's air defenses. The strikes are seen as retaliation for decades of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism against India. As India looks at imminent options to crack down on the threat of cross-border terrorism following the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, India Today TV spoke to a few defence experts on what options India can avail to tackle the issue."

The Supreme Court on Friday rejected all the petitions seeking the complete verification of votes cast using Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) with Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips. A two-judge bench comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta also rejected a demand to go back to ballot papers in elections. \"We rejected all pleas related to bringing ballot papers again.\" Justice Khanna said at the hearing. During the hearing, the bench said that it gave the Election Commission of India (ECI) two directions. \"One direction is after the completion of the symbol loading process, the Symbol Loading Unit (SLU) should be sealed. The SLU should be stored at least for a period of 45 days,\" it said. \"The burnt memory in the microcontroller EVM shall be checked by a team of engineers after the declaration of results on a request by candidates in serial numbers 2 and 3. Such a request has to be made within seven days after the declaration of results.\" Justice Khanna further asked the poll body to examine the suggestion for an electronic machine for vote counting the paper slips and whether along with the symbol there can be a bar code for each party. Justice Khanna said the \"expenses for the verification (of the program) to be borne by the candidates making the request, in case the EVM is found to be tampered, the expenses will be refunded\". \"Blindly distrusting a system can lead to unwarranted suspicions,\" Justice Datta said, adding, \"democracy is all about maintaining harmony and trust among all the pillars\". On April 18, the court had reserved its judgement on the petitions after a two-day hearing, and on Wednesday, it asked the ECI to provide clarification on five of its queries regarding the functioning of EVMs. During the hearing on Wednesday, the bench asked the poll body to clarify if the microcontroller is installed in the controlling unit or in the VVPAT; is the microcontroller one-time programmable; the number of available Symbol Loading Units; data period storage; and whether the Control Unit is only sealed or is the VVPAT is kept separately. After a poll body official responded to the court's queries, the bench said, \"We cannot control the elections, we cannot control the functioning of another constitutional authority.\" \"The ECI has cleared doubts. We cannot change your thought process. We cannot issue a mandamus on the basis of suspicion,\" it added. Presently, VVPAT verification is done only in five randomly selected EVMs in each Assembly segment of a parliamentary constituency. At all the EVM-VVPAT verification hearings, the ECI had maintained that the EVMs cannot be tampered with under any circumstances and that the complete counting of the VVPAT slips is not practically feasible. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court had issued a notice to the ECI on a petition seeking the counting of all VVPAT paper slips in elections, instead of verifying only the five randomly selected EVMs. The petition challenged the Election Commission's guidelines that mandate that VVPAT verification shall be done sequentially, that is one after the other, thereby causing undue delay. It contended that if simultaneous verification was done and an additional number of officers were deployed for counting in each Assembly constituency, then complete VVPAT verification could be done in just five to six hours."

The drama is set to premiere on Netflix on May 24. For the first time in her career, Korean actor Park Bo-young will take on dual roles. This role expands further when both the characters she plays take the other's identity, compelling Bo-young to deliver a nuanced performance that captures four separate personas. The trailer starts with their childhood memories together with the line \u201cDoppelganger, Hardheaded. We were together from page one,\u201d and then there is a split screen showing them at a bus station portraying different life choices. While Yu Mi-rae is seen in a crowded station, Yu Mi-ji is seen cycling through an empty road in the countryside. Mi-rae is portrayed as a diligent office worker while Mi-ji works at a supermarket. As shown in the trailer, Mi-ji doesn't like talking about her dreams and is visibly tired of her mother constantly asking how she will face her sister, Mi-rae. The trailer then shifts to snippets of tragic events, accompanied by the question, \u201cAre you comfortable?\u201d One scene shows Mi-rae attempting suicide, only to be saved by Mi-ji. Jinyoung, who plays the character Lee Ho-soo, is later seen offering to help Mi-rae. The trailer ends on a pistive note, as Mi-rae and Mi-ji ry to find their true selves. 'Our Unwritten Seoul\u2019 centres on twin sisters, Yu Mi-ji and Yu Mi-rae, who are identical in appearance yet opposite in personality and choose different life paths. After a complicated twist of fate, they swap identities, each sister navigating unfamiliar challenges to discover love and their true selves. Park Bo-young masterfully portrays both Yu Mi-ji, a vivacious former sprinting prodigy whose promising athletic career was tragically cut short, and Yu Mi-rae, her more reserved sister. The series is directed by Park Shin-woo, known for dramas like \u2018It\u2019s Okay Not to be Okay\u2019, and written by Lee Kang, known for dramas like \u2018Youth of May\u2019. The series is planned by Studio Dragon and co-produced by Monster Union, Higround, and Next Scene. Park Bo-young was last seen in the drama \u2018Melo Movie\u2019, released in February 2025. Jinyoung was last seen in the drama \u2018The Witch\u2019, which was also released in February 2025."

After the lukewarm reception to 'Retro', which hit the screens on May 1, Suriya has swiftly moved on to his next project. He is currently working on 'Suriya 45' with RJ Balaji. The film also marks his reunion with actor Trisha Krishnan after nearly two decades. The duo last shared screen space in 'Aaru' (2005), and have previously appeared together in 'Mounam Pesiyadhe' and 'Aaytha Ezhuthu'. Reports indicate they will play lawyers in the film. On the other hand, Vijay Deverakonda is gearing up for his next big release, 'Kingdom', which is slated to hit theatres on July 4, 2025. The film also features Bhagyashree Borse and Satyadev in pivotal roles. Also read | Retro review: Suriya, Karthik's overstuffed film stumbles between eras and ideas"

A sequel to the 2005 comedy hit No Entry - featuring Salman Khan, Fardeen Khan, and Anil Kapoor - the film is being directed by Anees Bazmee and produced by Boney Kapoor. As per a report by Filmfare, casting decisions had been underway for several months. While Diljit was initially enthusiastic about joining the ensemble, he ultimately chose to step away from the project due to creative differences. \u201cDiljit was very excited to collaborate with Varun Dhawan and Arjun Kapoor. But over the last few weeks, he couldn\u2019t align with the film\u2019s creative vision. That\u2019s why he has decided to exit the project,\u201d a source told the publication. An official announcement regarding the final cast is still awaited. Interestingly, Diljit and Varun are currently working together on 'Border 2', which also stars Sunny Deol in the lead role. Back in 2024, Pinkvilla had reported that pre-production for 'No Entry 2' was in full swing. At the time, a source revealed, \u201cNo Entry 2 is a hilarious script that has everyone excited.

As it struggles to escape, a pack of dogs rushes to its rescue, barking and attacking the big cat in a show of solidarity. In the midst of the scuffle, the leopard escapes, but not before chasing another dog. The video, however, concludes without revealing the fate of the dog being pursued. Watch the video here: While the exact location of the incident is yet to be confirmed, sources suggest it took place in the BHEL area, which borders the Rajaji Tiger Reserve.

The company cited \u201corganisational changes\u201d as part of its strategy to adapt to a shifting market. One of those affected, Gabriela de Queiroz, served as Director of AI under Microsoft for Startups. In a now-viral post on X, she shared what she described as \u201cbittersweet news,\u201d writing, \u201cI was impacted by Microsoft\u2019s latest round of layoffs.\u201d According to her LinkedIn profile, Queiroz joined Microsoft in 2022 as a Principal Cloud Advocate. Eight months into the role, she moved up to lead AI efforts for startup initiatives within the company. In a follow-up post, she spoke about the sudden nature of the announcement. \u201cWe were asked to stop work immediately and set an out-of-office. But I chose to stay a little longer\u2014showing up for meetings, saying goodbye, wrapping up what I could. That felt right to me,\u201d she wrote.

            "text": "Can we say there\u2019s finally a clear timeline for the much-delayed Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake? If you are unaware, Ubisoft has confirmed that The Sands of Time remake will arrive by the end of March 2026. This means the title is expected to launch sometime during Ubisoft\u2019s 2025-26 financial year. While that\u2019s still a while away, it\u2019s at least a concrete window \u2014 especially after years of silence, delays and developmental troubles. To give a little recap, the remake was originally announced in 2020, and since then, it has had a rocky journey so far, including fan backlash to its first trailer, developer changes, and the game essentially going back to the drawing board. The latest update came during Ubisoft\u2019s earnings report for the 2024-25 fiscal year, where it outlined its plans for the next year and confirmed the Sands of Time remake as part of its upcoming line-up. Alongside the remake, Ubisoft also revealed titles such as Anno 117: Pax Romana, Rainbow Six Mobile, and The Division Resurgence are all targeting the same launch window. But we are here to talk about the Sands of Time remake. While Ubisoft had previously mentioned a vague 2026 timeline, this new statement helps narrow it down to a January-March release. Of course, that is assuming there are no further delays \u2014 something fans will be understandably wary of given how long the project has already taken. For those who\u2019ve been following the game, the journey has been anything but smooth. The original remake was in development at Ubisoft\u2019s India-based studios in Mumbai and Pune, but following criticism over poor visuals and a general lack of polish, Ubisoft shifted the project to its Montreal and Toronto teams. This transition brought a major overhaul, with the game reportedly being rebuilt from the ground up, including fresh animations, combat mechanics, and a complete visual makeover. Insiders familiar with the project have also hinted at a more authentic take on the setting. This includes casting a new actor of Persian origin for the Prince\u2019s role, replacing Yuri Lowenthal, who voiced the character in the original trilogy. Despite the delays, Ubisoft appears committed to delivering a better version of the game than what fans first saw. The success of Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown earlier this year has likely helped boost internal confidence, reminding Ubisoft that there is still strong interest in the franchise. As a fan myself, I am now only waiting for when Ubisoft decides to show the game again. A re-reveal trailer is expected any time now, considering we are less than a year away from the expected release. Stay tuned to India Today Tech for all the latest on the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake."

            "text": "Google has all but confirmed that its long-anticipated Android smart glasses will take centre stage at the upcoming I/O 2025. This developer conference is scheduled for 20 May. The tech giant gave a clue about its smart glasses during the livestream of The Android Show: I/O Edition, where Sameer Samat, President of Android Ecosystem, ended the broadcast by slipping on a futuristic-looking headset, teasing \u201ca few more really cool Android demos\u201d for the big day. Now, the concept of getting smart glasses from Google is not new. The tech giant has flirted with the idea of smart glasses before, with one of the most notable being Google Glass. However, this device didn\u2019t work out well for the company and was eventually discontinued. We can say the Google Glass was not very refined and was too wacky. In fact, the concept was also too early to make its way into the market. But now, particularly after success of the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, Google feels that it needs to enter the arena again. Google had earlier shown the prototype of the Android smart glasses multiple times. At the TED 2025 \u201cHumanity Reimagined\u201d event in Vancouver, the company showcased a working prototype of its Android XR glasses. Unlike earlier efforts, these new glasses closely resemble ordinary eyewear \u2014 like Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban \u2014 but come equipped with a suite of advanced features powered by Gemini, Google\u2019s generative AI. The prototype also showcased features like real-time transcription, translation, and even a memory function. This feature uses the onboard camera and AI to keep track of what the user is seeing \u2014 such as helping them recall where they last left their keys. Google even demonstrated how the prototype can record real-time conversations and perform visual recognition. Looking at it, the Android smart glasses seem far more refined and smarter than Google Glass. Another feature which looks promising is a built-in display. However, according to reports, the final product expected to debut at I/O might not include one. According to reports from South Korea's ETNews, Google is collaborating with Samsung on a separate smart glasses initiative codenamed \u201cHaean.\u201d While these smart glasses are still in the production stage, they are rumoured to arrive as a direct competitor to Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban smart glasses cost Rs 29,900 in India and feature an ultra-wide 12-megapixel camera to capture photos and videos.

            "text": "iQOO Neo 10 is scheduled to launch in India on May 26 iQOO is set to launch a new mid-range segment smartphone in India at the end of this week. The company has confirmed that the new smartphone, the iQOO Neo 10, will be officially launched in India on May 26. In the lead up to the launch, the company has been teasing a few details about the device, but a recent leak claims to reveal one of the most critical pieces of information about the phone \u2013 the pricing. Leaks suggest that the iQOO Neo 10 will be priced in India between the range of Rs 33,000 and Rs 35,000. Reportedly, the pricing of the phone may actually be higher, but it will be launched along with bank offers, which will bring its effective price down to Rs 35,000. This makes sense considering the iQOO Neo 10R (review), which is supposed to be a somewhat lighter version of the Neo 10, was launched earlier this year at a selling price of Rs 26,999, and the pricing of the highest variant currently goes up to Rs 30,999 (offers included). With its pricing being set at around Rs 35,000, the iQOO Neo 10 will be able to set its own price territory, without being too expensive. Ahead of the launch, a lot of details about the iQOO Neo 10 have already been confirmed. For instance, the company has already confirmed that the smartphone will be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 processor, and it will use a Vivo Q1 chip for camera processing. Supporting the system-on-chip will be LPPDDR5x RAM and UFS4.1 storage. The exact specifications for the RAM and storage are yet to be revealed. Additionally, the iQOO Neo 10 is confirmed to sport an AMOLED display with 1.5K resolution, a whopping 5,500nits of peak brightness and a refresh rate up to 144Hz. The size of the display has not been revealed but it will likely be larger than 6.5-inch. For perspective, the iQOO Neo 10R features a 6.78-inch AMOLED display, with similar display specifications with the exception of its support for 4,500nits peak brightness. iQOO also says that the iQOO Neo 10 will support 144FPS gaming, and will offer 3,000Hz touch sampling rate. One of the highlights of the smartphone will be its battery. iQOO has confirmed that the Neo 10 will come with a huge 7,000mAh battery, with support for 120W fast charging (wired). The company claims that the fast-charging tech will allow users to charge the phone from zero to 50 per cent in 15 minutes. For photography, the iQOO Neo 10 will sport a dual-camera setup on the rear, which will include a 50-megapixel Sony image sensor on the primary camera. For selfies, the phone is confirmed to come with a 32-megapixel camera.

While LLMs are often hit-or-miss when it comes to generating code, AlphaEvolve takes a different approach. It continuously refines its output by scoring each of Gemini\u2019s suggestions, discarding weaker attempts and iteratively improving the stronger ones. This evolutionary process enables the system to produce highly optimised algorithms, many of which outperform the best human-written alternatives in terms of speed or accuracy. One standout example of AlphaEvolve\u2019s capabilities, as shared by the company, is its role in improving Google\u2019s job scheduling software, which allocates computing tasks across millions of servers worldwide. According to DeepMind, the refined algorithm has been running in production across Google\u2019s global data centres for over a year, unlocking a 0.7 per cent gain in computing efficiency\u2014a modest-sounding figure, but a massive boost at Google\u2019s scale. AlphaEvolve also addresses one of the major pitfalls of modern AI: hallucinations. Most AI systems, due to their probabilistic nature, sometimes fabricate confident but false answers. In fact, newer models, including OpenAI\u2019s o3, have demonstrated an increased tendency to do so. To combat this, AlphaEvolve introduces an automated evaluation layer. It prompts the model to generate multiple potential answers, then critiques and scores them based on accuracy, effectively filtering out unreliable responses. Google DeepMind in its blogpost stated, \"AlphaEvolve verifies, runs and scores the proposed programs using automated evaluation metrics. These metrics provide an objective, quantifiable assessment of each solution\u2019s accuracy and quality. This makes AlphaEvolve particularly helpful in a broad range of domains where progress can be clearly and systematically measured, like in math and computer science.\" Using AlphaEvolve involves presenting it with a clearly defined problem\u2014this could include technical instructions, mathematical equations, code examples, or academic references. Crucially, the user must also supply a method for automatically assessing the output, typically via a formula or test mechanism. As such, AlphaEvolve is best suited to domains where self-verification is possible, like computing and systems optimisation. However, the system is not without its limitations. AlphaEvolve can only tackle problems it can evaluate on its own, and it exclusively produces algorithmic solutions. This means it's less effective\u2014or entirely unsuitable\u2014for tackling open-ended, qualitative, or non-numerical problems.

            "title": "Indian Test team after Rohit, Virat: A peek into the future",
            "text": "The two modern-day guardians of Indian cricket \u2013 Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli \u2013 have retired from two out of the three formats of international cricket. Between the two, India have scored 21,950 runs in T20I and Test cricket, and have also featured in six finals in ICC tournaments. Rohit and Kohli's departures feel bittersweet. Together, they broke India's ICC trophy jinx, winning the T20 World Cup 2024 and Champions Trophy 2025, and before that in 2023, they played one of the most dominating campaigns in the history of the ODI World Cup, albeit missing out on the trophy. While they retired from the T20I format on a high, leaving the Indian team an ample amount of time to prepare for the next tournament, their Test retirements came when they were at their all-time low. India are set to play a five-match Test series against England between June and August, which will also usher in the new World Test Championship cycle. It is imperative for the two-time WTC finalists to start well, given the confidence of the Test team is at an all-time low after their losses against New Zealand and Australia. The Indian management has to fill three holes in the playing XI for the England side: the opening slot left vacant by Rohit Sharma, the crucial No. 4 spot left by Virat Kohli, and the lead spinner\u2019s spot left by Ravichandran Ashwin. The Ashwin vacancy will not bother India in England, given the team does not play an out-and-out spinner in those conditions. Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, or Axar Patel are more than capable spinners for those conditions, who can also give a fine output with the bat. Here\u2019s a look at what India\u2019s squad could look like in the absence of the three stalwarts of the Indian cricket team. The last time India played in England (2021/22), Rohit Sharma was a beast of a Test batter. 345 runs in four Tests at an average of 57.50 \u2013 this was a very different kind of Rohit Sharma, seen in the past two years. Rohit\u2019s signature style was to dent the new ball by defending everything, and then unleashing on the fast bowlers. India would ideally need Rohit\u2019s assurance at the top, and the man perhaps best fit for that role is KL Rahul. Rahul was Rohit\u2019s partner in 2021, scoring 315 runs from four matches, after being shoehorned in, in place of Mayank Agarwal. KL Rahul has been moved across the batting line-up in the last few years, and he has done it without any complaints. In the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Down Under, Rahul looked like the only batter apart from Yashasvi Jaiswal who had the confidence to score runs. It is perhaps time that India settled him in one position in the next two-and-a-half-year cycle. Very few batters in world cricket brought in confidence at No. 4 as Virat Kohli. In his 14-year Test career, there were times that Virat Kohli looked invincible with the blade in his hand. One can argue that Virat sacrificed many of his Test runs in the hunt for wins in the Indian subcontinent, making pitches that were friendlier towards bowlers. \"I don't mind compromising on (batsmen's) averages as long as we are winning Test matches,\" Kohli had said in 2015 after a match against South Africa at home. If one wants the swagger of Virat Kohli back at No. 4, they should not look beyond Shubman Gill. His short-arm jab, his ability to drive the ball at will \u2013 Shubman is an elite batter. Shubman transitioned from opening to No. 3 in 2022, and it is perhaps time that he settled into No. 4, where the most important batter in any Test team plays. In case India give Shubman the No. 4 position, the team will have to find someone steady at No. 3. It would be highly recommended that they do not look at KL Rahul once again, who has been moved in and out of positions. India have choices at their hands \u2013 if they want someone dynamic, Sai Sudharsan is their man. If they want someone with defensive capabilities, they have Karun Nair at their hands, who just played out a record-breaking season in the Ranji Trophy. If they want someone with grit and the ability to bite down in hard circumstances, maybe they can audition Sarfaraz Khan. And this is where Rohit Sharma\u2019s \u2018garden me ghoomne vaale\u2019 kids come into play. They will have to step up big time in the England series, because that essentially sets the tone for what\u2019s to come. If India win in England, Gautam Gambhir gets a fresh slate, free of any baggage from Australia, because this will be his team \u2013 a team that he himself has designed. But if India lose in England, the panic would set in once again, and Gambhir might also lose his job, in the Test format at least."

            "text": "South Africa players will now return on June 3 for WTC preps. (Photo: PTI) Hours after saying that South African players will return from the IPL for the World Test Championship final on May 26, Cricket South Africa (CSA) has performed a U-turn and announced that the squad members for the summit clash against Australia would now start their training on June 3. The BCCI confirmed on May 12 that the IPL will resume on May 17, with the final of the tournament set for June 3. This left South African and Australian players in a tough spot as the WTC final is all set to begin at Lord's on June 11. CSA reiterated their commitment to the WTC final preparations at first, saying that they had told BCCI that the players would return on May 26. \"It is an individual decision, obviously, to return or to play or continue,\" CSA's director of national teams and high performance Enoch Nkwe said during press conference. \"One thing we've made clear, and we are finalising this with the IPL and the BCCI, is sticking to our original plan when it comes to the WTC preparations.\" \"May 26 is the latest for the Test guys to come back. The original plans don't change because the No. 1 priority is the WTC final. We've been engaging with them over the last day or two to make sure we're all on the same page.\" However, a report by the West Australian Today has said that Nkwe went back on his statement and said that the date for return has been changed. Nkwe said discussion is happening at the executive and board levels between CSA, the BCCI and IPL franchises. \u201cCorrection \u2013 the squad will resume training for the game on June 3rd,\u201d he said. \u201cThe matter is being discussed higher up than me. At ground level, we are focusing on preps for the WTC final.\u201d The playoffs of the revised IPL 2025 schedule will run from May 29 to June 3, which will be the date of the final. This will mean that South Africa's preparation game against Zimbabwe will have to be pushed back."

Last year, she also defeated Zheng in the final of the Australian Open at the Rod Laver Arena. But on Wednesday, Zheng opened her account, winning 6-4, 6-3 on Centre Court. The 22-year-old Zheng also ended Sabalenka\u2019s 15-match winning streak in WTA 1000 events. Sabalenka, who had won the Miami Open followed by the Madrid Open earlier this year, looked completely out of sorts and surrendered without much of a fight. Zheng took an hour and 37 minutes to get the better of Sabalenka. In the first set, the Paris Olympic gold medallist earned a break to come up trumps. Sabalenka would have been gutted for not being able to convert any of her three break point chances. Zheng dominated even in the second set, breaking Sabalenka\u2019s serve twice. Yet again, Sabalenka couldn\u2019t make use of the two break point opportunities she got. Zheng also outplayed Sabalenka in first serves, winning 82.4 per cent of points from them. Sabalenka only won 59.1 per cent of her first serve points. In the semi-final, Zheng will be up against USA\u2019s Coco Gauff, who is fresh from beating teen sensation Mirra Andreeva in straight sets.

            "text": "Brazil football legends Dunga, Felipe Melo and Mauro Silva have hailed the impending arrival of Carlo Ancelotti as the new head coach of the national team and hopes that the Italian can bring about a change in fortunes for the side. Ancelotti, who is currently the coach of Real Madrid, will leave his post with Los Blancos at the end of the season and take up the Brazil job. Ancelotti is the first manager to capture titles in each of Europe's top five leagues, for England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France and also guided Real Madrid to two Champions League and La Liga doubles in three seasons. Speaking to the reporters, as quoted by Reuters, Melo said that everyone is happy with the arrival of the best coach in the world. \"I'm very happy, and I can't believe there's anyone who isn't happy when the arrival of the best coach in the world is announced,\" Felipe Melo, a three-time Copa Libertadores winner and World Cup player with Brazil in 2010, told reporters. Since Tite left the job in late 2022, Brazil have appointed and parted ways with Ramon Menezes, Fernando Diniz, and Dorival Jr. but success hasn't come their way. Brazil are currently fourth in CONMEBOL, with six wins from 14 matches. Former World Cup-winning captain Dunga said that Ancelotti has been brought in to get results and everyone has to help him. \"If we changed four coaches in less than three years, something isn't working (...) In my opinion, Ancelotti was brought in to get results, so we have to help him,\" said Dunga. Silva said that Ancelotti has a broader vision of different football schools around the world and that will be a great asset for Brazil. The former World Cup winner said it is a delicate moment for Brazilian football and is hoping that Ancelotti succeeds, despite some structural issues. \"He has a broader vision of the different football schools around the world, and I think that's a great asset,\" said Mauro Silva, a World Cup winner with Brazil in 1994. \"It's a delicate moment for Brazilian football. We have some structural issues, but all in all, I hope Ancelotti succeeds.\" Ancelotti's first job with Brazil will be to finalise the preliminary squad for the World Cup qualifiers against Ecuador and Paraguay next month. On May 26, the Italian is expected to announce the squad. Read More: | Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim insists he has no plans to quit"

(Photo: Nasa) Nasa's Magellan mission launched in 1989 has now revealed unknown facts about Venus, which is also dubbed as Earth's mysterious twin. Researchers discovered, hidden in the archival data, new evidence that tectonic activity may be deforming the Venus\u2019s surface. This is another similarity the planet could be sharing with Earth, which is continually renewed by the constant shifting and recycling of massive sections of crust, called tectonic plates, that float atop a viscous interior. Researchers studied a type of feature called a corona that ranges in size from dozens to hundreds of miles across. Nasa said that corona is most often thought to be the location where a plume of hot, buoyant material from the planet\u2019s mantle rises, pushing against the lithosphere above. These structures are usually oval, with a concentric fracture system surrounding them. Hundreds of coronae are known to exist on Venus. The details, published in the journal Science Advances, reveal the evidence of this tectonic activity within data from NASA\u2019s Magellan mission, which orbited Venus in the 1990s and gathered the most detailed gravity and topography data on the planet currently available. \u201cCoronae are not found on Earth today; however, they may have existed when our planet was young and before plate tectonics had been established. By combining gravity and topography data, this research has provided a new and important insight into the possible subsurface processes currently shaping the surface of Venus,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author, Gael Cascioli said. The spacecraft used its radar system to see through Venus\u2019 thick atmosphere and map the topography of its mountains and plains. Researchers found a number of coronae on Venus. \"The most exciting thing for our study is that we can now say there are most likely various and ongoing active processes driving their formation. We believe these same processes may have occurred early in Earth\u2019s history,\u201d coauthor Anna Glcher added. This work marks the latest instance of scientists returning to Magellan data to find that Venus exhibits geologic processes that are more Earth-like than originally thought."

Shukla, serving as mission pilot, is set to become the first Indian to visit the ISS and only the second Indian in space since Rakesh Sharma\u2019s 1984 flight. Axiom Space and NASA cited the need to review the ISS flight schedule and ensure operational readiness for several upcoming missions as the reason for the postponement. During the Ax-4 mission, expected to last up to 14 days, Shukla will conduct a series of scientific experiments, including studies on muscle loss, microgravity adaptation, and bio-farming.

            "text": "This artist\u2019s concept shows the Moon\u2019s hot interior and volcanism about 2 to 3 billion years ago. (Photo: Nasa) Moon has two sides, one visible to us and the other permanently hidden away from Earth as the natural satellite remains tidally locked on one side. A new Nasa study, published in Nature, has now revealed why the two sides, the far side and the nearside, of the Moon are completely different from each other. Researchers developed a new gravity model of the Moon that includes tiny variations in the celestial body\u2019s gravity during its elliptical orbit around Earth. Nasa said that these fluctuations cause the Moon to flex slightly due to Earth\u2019s tidal force \u2014 a process called tidal deformation \u2014 which provides critical insights into the Moon\u2019s deep internal structure. The data from the Nasa's GRAIL, or Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory, mission indicates that the moon's deep interior has an asymmetrical structure, apparently caused by intense volcanism on its nearside billions of years ago that helped shape its surface features. \"Our study shows that the moon's interior is not uniform: the side facing Earth - the nearside - is warmer and more geologically active deep down than the farside,\" said Ryan Park, supervisor of the Solar System Dynamics Group at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The moon's nearside is covered by vast plains, called mare, formed from molten rock that cooled and solidified billions of years ago. Its farside has much more rugged terrain, with few plains. Some theories suggest intense volcanism on the near side likely caused the gravitational differences. That process would have caused radioactive, heat-generating elements to accumulate deep inside the near side\u2019s mantle, and the new study offers the strongest evidence yet that this is likely the case. \"The moon plays a vital role in stabilising Earth's rotation and generating ocean tides, which influence natural systems and daily rhythms. Our knowledge of the moon has expanded through human and robotic missions that have revealed details about its surface and interior, yet many questions about its deep structure and history remain. As our closest neighbour, the moon continues to be an important focus of scientific discovery,\" Ryan added. From the two studies, the team could better understand what the Moon and Vesta are made of and how planetary bodies across the solar system formed."

Shukla, who was originally scheduled to launch on May 29 as part of Axiom Space\u2019s Ax-4 mission, will now lift off from Nasa\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida in early June due to a minor technical issue detected during pre-launch preparations. Shukla\u2019s mission is historic for India. He will be the first Indian to travel to the ISS and only the second Indian in space, four decades after Rakesh Sharma\u2019s iconic 1984 mission aboard a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft. During the mission, Shukla and his international crewmates will conduct scientific research, technology demonstrations, and outreach activities. Shukla is also expected to carry out experiments relevant to India\u2019s upcoming Gaganyaan human spaceflight program, including studies on muscle loss, microgravity adaptation, and bio-farming. A decorated test pilot with over 2,000 hours of flying experience, Shukla was selected for India\u2019s astronaut program in 2019 and has undergone extensive training in Russia, India, and the US. His participation in the Ax-4 mission is seen as a critical step in India\u2019s ambitions to become a key player in global human spaceflight and to prepare for the country\u2019s first indigenous crewed mission, Gaganyaan, scheduled for 2027. Despite the delay, officials from ISRO and Axiom Space have expressed full confidence in the reliability of the launch vehicle and the mission\u2019s overall readiness."

In terms of the score itself, the Fronx scored 163.75 out of 193.8 points in the Overall Safety Performance, which is an impressive 84 per cent. In the Preventive Safety Performance, again, the Fronx was impressive once again with a total score of 79.42 out of 85.8 points, which amounts to 92 per cent. In the Collision Safety Performance, it scored 76.33 out of 100 points and in the Automatic Emergency Call System, the Fronx produced a perfect 8 out of 8 score. Furthermore, it was tested for pedestrian safety as well, wherein it scored Level 3/5 for pedestrian head protection and a Level 5 for pedestrian leg protection, which again is a good score. When it comes to Autonomous Emergency braking, the Fronx scored a perfect Level 5 rating, and Level 3 for the intersection part of the test. It remains to be seen if the Fronx sold in India can secure a similar score, since it lacks the aforementioned additional safety equipment."

It first showcased the Flying Flea C6 at EICMA 2024, as a new electric brand outside the purview of Royal Enfield\u2019s legacy. The brand is looking to alter the paradigm of the electric two-wheeler space by using legacy value that draws on Royal Enfield\u2019s iconic paramilitary motorcycle called the \u2018flying flea\u2019 for its lightweight approach to construction that allowed it to be dropped out of military aircraft right onto the battlefield. Very similarly, the first two motorcycles from the brand will be minimalist and lightweight, challenging the existing electric two-wheeler framework. According to Royal Enfield, it filed 45 patents pertaining to a range of native technologies. The company has also developed a central 'Vehicle Control Unit,' integrating physical digital touchpoints. The VCU offers more than 200,000 ride mode combinations, continuously monitors the motorcycle's performance, and stays current through Over The Air (OTA) updates and new feature integrations. The FF-C6, available in both single-seat and dual-seat versions, will include features such as lean-angle sensitive ABS and a convenient domestic 3-pin charging plug. Not just the C6, Royal Enfield will also launch a scrambler version under the Flying Flea brand, which will be called the S6. Royal Enfield will first launch the C6, followed by the S6. However, the company hasn't revealed the exact timeline for the S6."

Limited to just 1,990 units worldwide\u2014a nod to the 1990 debut\u2014this exclusive motorcycle blends nostalgic design with modern technology, priced at $25,399 (around Rs 21.65 lakh). The Fat Boy Gray Ghost dazzles with its Reflection finish, a chrome-like sheen achieved through physical vapor deposition (PVD). This innovative process coats the fuel tank and fenders, marking the first time Harley-Davidson has applied PVD to such large components on a production model. The result is a mirror-like brilliance that surpasses traditional chrome plating while meeting stringent corrosion-resistance standards. \u201cThe original Fat Boy redefined custom style with its bold proportions and post-war DNA,\u201d said Brad Richards, Harley-Davidson\u2019s Vice President of Design and Creative Director. \u201cThe Gray Ghost amplifies that legacy with a modern, industrial edge.\u201d Nostalgic touches include a round air cleaner, yellow accents on the powertrain and tank console, and a leather seat valance with lacing and tassels. The iconic winged fuel tank medallions and a serialised tank console insert pay homage to the original, while an Icons Collection medallion adorns the rear fender. Chrome side covers and a bright silver powder-coated frame complete the radiant look, paired with exclusive Lakester cast aluminium wheels and Michelin Scorcher 11 tires (160/60R18 front, 240/40R18 rear). Powering the Gray Ghost is a 1,923cc V-twin engine, delivering 101bhp at 4,800rpm and 166Nm of torque at 3,000rpm. Enhanced with a 2-into-2 exhaust and advanced muffler materials, the engine emphasises deep, resonant tones. A frame-mounted oil cooler and cylinder head cooling passages ensure rider comfort in hot conditions or low-speed riding. The motorcycle features recalibrated suspension for optimal comfort, with dual-bending valve 49mm front forks and hydraulic pre-load adjustment for the rear. Selectable ride modes (Road, Rain, Sport) tailor performance, while Harley-Davidson\u2019s rider safety enhancements include cornering ABS, traction control, and tyre pressure monitoring. All-LED lighting, a USB-C power port, relocated heated gear connectors, and a new 5-inch analogue-digital instrument cluster elevate the riding experience. With only 1,990 units produced, the Fat Boy Gray Ghost is a collector\u2019s dream, blending iconic style with modern performance. Although there's no official confirmation regarding its launch in India, considering the limited global production of just 1,990 units, it remains to be seen if any, will make it to the country."

(Photo: GettyImages) Indian mutual funds turned buyers in the IT sector this April, even as foreign investors pulled out large sums. This came during a time of uncertainty caused by weak earnings and concerns over US growth due to tariff issues. According to Primedatabase data, mutual funds invested over Rs 9,599 crore in IT shares during the month. In contrast, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold more than Rs 15,000 crore worth of tech stocks, as per NSDL data. Unlike FIIs, mutual funds release detailed monthly reports showing exactly where they\u2019ve put their money. This gives a clearer picture of stock-wise investments. Among IT companies, Infosys saw the highest interest from mutual funds, with fresh investments of Rs 3,011 crore. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Coforge followed, receiving Rs 2,375 crore and Rs 1,432 crore, respectively. Other major names that drew investment included HCL Technologies, Persistent Systems, Mphasis, LTIMindtree, Hexaware, and Cyient, with amounts ranging from Rs 170 crore to Rs 960 crore. However, mutual funds did sell shares of some tech firms. They reduced their holdings in Tech Mahindra by Rs 270 crore and also cut down on Birlasoft and Zaggle Prepaid, selling more than Rs 85 crore each. Smaller cuts were made in Oracle Financial Services, Affle, Neweb Technologies, and Inventurus Knowledge Solutions. Meanwhile, both mutual funds and FIIs put money into financial stocks. MFs invested Rs 4,450 crore in this space, while FIIs were even more bullish, pouring in Rs 18,409 crore. Kotak Mahindra Bank attracted the highest MF investment in the financial sector, with Rs 1,586 crore. IDFC First Bank and HDFC Bank followed, drawing Rs 1,150 crore and Rs 1,026 crore. Other financial names that saw increased MF holdings included Max Financial Services, Axis Bank, HDFC Life, RBL Bank, and Shriram Finance. On the other hand, mutual funds pulled money out of the telecom and FMCG sectors. They sold Rs 2,787 crore worth of telecom shares and Rs 2,211 crore in FMCG stocks. Interestingly, FIIs did the opposite, buying Rs 4,648 crore worth of telecom shares and Rs 2,917 crore in FMCG. Bharti Airtel saw the biggest MF exit in telecom, with Rs 2,499 crore worth of shares sold. Indus Towers and Bharti Hexacom followed with sell-offs of Rs 584 crore and Rs 173 crore. In FMCG, the biggest drop came in ITC, where MFs reduced holdings by Rs 2,779 crore. HUL and Marico also faced selling of Rs 596 crore and Rs 382 crore. Other FMCG companies that saw mutual fund exits included Nestle India, Tata Consumer Products, United Spirits, and Avanti Feeds."

            "text": "Brokerage firm CLSA has given Tata Motors an \u2018outperform\u2019 rating and set a target price of Rs 805. Shares of Tata Motors rose by nearly 3% on Thursday, recovering some ground after falling around the previous day following its fourth-quarter results for the financial year 2024\u201325. The company's shares were trading at Rs 717.35, up 2.63%, at the time this report was written. The stock opened at Rs 699.15 and touched the day\u2019s high of Rs 717.35. The rise in Tata Motors\u2019 share price comes even after the company reported a 51% fall in its consolidated net profit to Rs 8,470 crore for the quarter ending March 2025. In the same period last year, the company had reported a profit of Rs 17,407 crore. Kranthi Bathini, Equity Strategist at WealthMills Securities Pvt Ltd, said that Tata Motors was in a consolidation phase recently and the current US and China trade deal is definitely a positive for Tata Motors. \"The trade deal between UK and US also in a way very positive for Tata Motors with respect to the JLR sales are concerned. The free trade agreement between India and UK helps Tata Motors JLR portfolio sales very attractive and competitive with Indian luxury brands, which has a positive impact in the medium to long term. So, that is the reason we can see some kind of buying interest that is emerging in Tata Motors,\" he added. Brokerage firm CLSA has given Tata Motors an \u2018outperform\u2019 rating and set a target price of Rs 805. Analysts at CLSA said that the performance of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) was in line with expectations. Tata Motors' commercial vehicle business also performed well, with EBITDA margin, including the benefit from the government\u2019s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, at 12.2%. The India passenger vehicle segment posted an EBITDA margin of 7.9%, which was a 60 basis points rise from the previous quarter. Analysts attributed this improvement to a better mix of products and the support from PLI incentives. The company\u2019s efforts in the electric vehicle (EV) space have also made news recently. Tata Motors announced that two of its electric cars, the Curvv.ev and Tiago.ev, are now available for procurement through the Government e-Marketplace (GeM). These vehicles were also delivered to Rashtrapati Bhavan, underlining the company's progress in supplying EVs to government bodies. By listing the Curvv.ev and Tiago.ev on GeM, Tata Motors is allowing government departments across the country to purchase these electric models, which supports the shift to cleaner transport. While the profit figures were down, Tata Motors reported a slight rise in total revenue from operations. The company\u2019s consolidated revenue for the quarter was Rs 1,19,503 crore, up 0.4% from Rs 1,19,033 crore during the same period last year. This was lower than market estimates. Despite the decline in profit, Tata Motors announced a dividend for shareholders. In a filing to the stock exchanges, the company said, \u201cThe Board of Directors at its meeting held today has recommended declaration of final dividend of Rs 6 per equity share of Rs 2 each (at 300%) for the financial year ended March 31, 2025.\u201d (Disclaimer: The views, opinions, recommendations, and suggestions expressed by experts/brokerages in this article are their own and do not reflect the views of the India Today Group.

            "title": "Raymond shares jump 5%. Why stock hit upper circuit today?",
            "text": "According to the scheme of arrangement, each shareholder of Raymond will receive one share of Raymond Realty for every share held in Raymond. Raymond Ltd shares surged 5% on Thursday, hitting the upper circuit limit and recovering some ground after a sharp plunge in the previous session. The rebound comes as investors recalibrate following the recent demerger of the company\u2019s real estate arm, Raymond Realty. At the Bombay Stock Exchange, Raymond shares were locked at Rs 578.70 in early trade, up 4.99%. The buying comes a day after the stock appeared to lose more than 60% of its value, a fall that was not driven by weak fundamentals or selling pressure but by a mechanical price adjustment. Wednesday\u2019s steep decline caught many investors off guard, especially those using trading platforms that did not immediately reflect the post-demerger price adjustment. The drop, however, was purely technical. Shareholders of Raymond Ltd will receive one share of Raymond Realty for every share held, as per the scheme approved earlier this month. Raymond Realty, which has carved out a strong position in Mumbai\u2019s residential real estate market, will be listed separately by the September quarter. Until then, the parent company\u2019s stock will no longer include the realty business in its valuation, hence the markdown. Market experts had urged investors not to panic, pointing out that the drop in Raymond Ltd\u2019s share price was a repricing event. \u201cThis is a notional correction, not a fundamental one. Investors now hold shares in two separate entities with distinct growth trajectories,\u201d said one analyst. The enthusiasm around Raymond Realty\u2019s impending listing is not without reason. In Q4 FY25, the real estate arm reported Rs 766 crore in revenue, up 13% year-on-year. EBITDA stood at Rs 194 crore with a margin of 25.3%, and the business sits on a healthy net cash surplus of 399 crore. The company is actively expanding beyond its Thane base, having recently signed JDAs in Mahim and Wadala with a combined potential value of 6,800 crore. These projects take the estimated gross development value of Raymond Realty\u2019s portfolio to nearly 40,000 crore. \u201cThis strategic move reinforces our commitment to unlock shareholder value and focus on pure-play businesses,\u201d said Chairman and MD Gautam Hari Singhania. The realty demerger follows Raymond\u2019s earlier spinoff of its lifestyle division, which listed on the bourses in September 2024. Both steps are part of a larger transformation to create sharper business verticals and offer investors greater transparency and focused opportunities. While the initial volatility may have triggered knee-jerk reactions, Thursday\u2019s sharp rebound reflects renewed investor confidence as the dust around the demerger settles. With a strong order book, a robust balance sheet, and a clear listing timeline, Raymond Realty\u2019s next chapter may yet be one of the group\u2019s most value-accretive."

            "text": "A sudden spike in dust pollution since last night has blanketed Delhi and its surrounding regions in a thick layer of dust, severely affecting visibility and deteriorating the air quality. The Air Quality Index (AQI) has breached the 200-mark, entering the \u2018poor\u2019 category, raising serious health concerns. Data from multiple pollution observation centres in the capital show PM10 and PM2.5 levels soaring to nearly 20 times the normal limits. These fine particulate matters are considered hazardous to human health, especially for individuals with respiratory conditions. Post-midnight, the wind speed dropped significantly to around 3\u20137 km/h, allowing the dust to linger in the atmosphere. As a result, visibility has remained low, fluctuating between 1,200 and 1,500 meters. This sharp decline in visibility not only poses a risk to road traffic but also poses a serious threat to those suffering from respiratory ailments such as asthma and bronchitis. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) explained the cause behind this sudden environmental shift. According to the IMD, strong, dust-laden winds blew across the Palam area near IGI Airport between 10:00 PM and 11:30 PM, reducing visibility drastically from 4,500 meters to just 1,200 meters. Wind speeds during this period reached 30\u201340 km/h, contributing to the swift dispersal of dust particles across the region. In a surprising development, several monitoring stations have stopped displaying PM10 readings, sparking questions about their reliability. In a slight reprieve, the IMD reported that this morning, westerly winds at 10 km/h helped improve visibility in the Palam area from 1,300 meters to 1,500 meters. The weather department expects a gradual decline in pollution levels over the coming days."

            "text": "The fire engulfed the bus within minutes, reducing it to ashes Five people, including two children, were burnt alive after a fire broke out in a moving sleeper bus in Lucknow. The bus, travelling from Delhi to Bihar, was carrying around 60 passengers at the time of the incident. According to eyewitnesses, the bus was heavily overcrowded. In fact, extra seats had been installed near the exit window, which was shut, making rescue efforts extremely difficult once the fire broke out. Most passengers were asleep when the blaze began. Thick smoke filled the interior, waking them up and causing widespread panic. The fire spread rapidly, engulfing the bus within minutes and reducing it to ashes. The intensity of the fire was such that flames were visible from nearly a kilometre away. In a disturbing detail, eyewitnesses claimed the bus kept moving for almost a kilometre even after the fire broke out, which further intensified the flames. The driver allegedly smashed the windshield, jumped out, and fled the scene. Eyewitnesses also revealed that he didn\u2019t alert any of the passengers before fleeing. Several passengers became trapped, especially near the front, where the extra seat blocked the main exit route. Locals rushed to the scene upon learning about the fire and quickly informed the police and fire brigade. However, by the time emergency services arrived and managed to douse the flames, the bus had already been completely gutted. Among the victims was Masoodan Kumar, a resident of Begusarai, Bihar, who was travelling with his relatives Randhir Kumar and Ravi Kishan to Delhi to visit their brother. Tragically, Masoodan lost his life, while Ravi sustained serious injuries. Another survivor, Afroz, who was travelling with his wife and two children to Delhi, recounted how he saved his family. \u201cWhen the fire broke out, I threw my child out of the window and jumped along with my wife,\u201d he said. However, all of their belongings were destroyed in the fire. Mohit, who works in an IT company, lost his laptop and important documents in the blaze. Dharveer was unable to save his mother and sister, both of whom perished in the fire. Village head Ram Khilawan Rawat, who arrived at the scene, confirmed that the driver continued driving for nearly a kilometre after the fire started, worsening the situation. He also stated that arrangements for food, water, and financial support have been made for the victims. Nipun Agarwal, Deputy Commissioner of Police South Zone confirmed that five people died in the incident and the rest were rescued. He said the cause of the fire is believed to be a short circuit, and added that women and children were among the deceased."

(Representative image) The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday invited bids to remediate 185 lakh tonnes of legacy waste at the Deonar dumping ground for the redevelopment of Dharavi, Asia's largest slum. With an estimated contract valued at over Rs 2,368 crore, this is among the largest tenders floated in recent years by the BMC for solid waste management. In October last year, the Maharashtra cabinet approved a proposal to hand over a portion of the Deonar dumping ground for the Dharavi redevelopment project. Of the 126.30 hectares of land, the BMC will keep 55 hectares of land while the Dharavi redevelopment project authorities will get 70.82 hectares of land. \"All the existing waste at Deonar will be cleared. Hence, the contract states reclamation of approximately 110 hectares of land,\" an official said. The scope of the project covers the reclamation of approximately 110 hectares of land at the Deonar site, one of Mumbai's oldest solid waste dumping grounds. It includes bioremediation of 185 lakh tonnes of legacy waste along with the disposal of excavated, processed and segregated material. The Dharavi redevelopment project has faced numerous setbacks since the Maharashtra government first proposed an action plan in 2004. Despite multiple failed attempts to attract bidders over the years, the Adani Group won the bid in November 2023 to redevelop 645 acres of prime land in central Mumbai.

            "text": "In 2024, Turkey recorded 5.26 crore foreign visitors, with 3.3 lakh from India. A fallout from the recent India-Pakistan conflict appears to be Indian tourists\u2019 boycott of Turkey (Trkiye) and Azerbaijan, as both nations backed Pakistan. And of the two, Turkey is facing a stronger backlash. After all, Pakistan used Turkish-made drones in its attacks. Many Indians called for these boycotts on social media, including popular singer Vishal Mishra, who declared: \"Never ever going to Turkey and Azerbaijan!\". Actor and Bharatiya Janata Party member Rupali Ganguly said, \"Can we please cancel our bookings for Turkey? This is my request to all Indian celebs/ influencers/ travellers. This is the least we can do as Indians.\" The Confederation of All India Traders also called for these travel boycotts against Turkey and Azerbaijan. Praveen Khandelwal, CAIT Secretary General and Member of Parliament, stated that such boycotts would hurt the economies of both countries. Turkey reportedly earned $61.1 billion from tourism in 2024, of which Indian tourists accounted for $291.6 million. But this is only 0.48 per cent India contribute. Azerbaijan also benefited significantly from Indian visitors, who contributed around $308.6 million to its economy. Travel companies like EaseMyTrip and Go Homestays have already halted tour packages for Turkey and Azerbaijan. EaseMyTrip co-founder, Prashant Pitti, told CNN-News18 that there was a significant rise in cancellations for these countries. He said that cancellations for Turkey reached about 22 per cent, while for Azerbaijan, it was over 30 per cent. \u201cIndian travellers have expressed strong sentiments over the past one week, with bookings for Azerbaijan and Turkey decreasing by 60 per cent, while cancellations have surged by 250 per cent during the same period,\u201d a spokesperson for MakeMyTrip told Business Standard. According to Tourism of Turkey data, Indian arrivals did not cross two per cent of total foreign arrivals. In 2015, out of 3.62 crore foreign arrivals, only 1.3 lakh were from India, just 0.4 per cent. These figures include all purposes of travel. By 2019, foreign visitor arrivals in Turkey rose to 4.51 crore, with India accounting for just 2.3 lakh, only 0.5 per cent. In 2023, total arrivals increased to 4.92 crore, while Indian arrivals stood at 2.7 lakh or 0.6 per cent. And in 2024, Turkey recorded 5.26 crore foreign visitors, with only 3.3 lakh from India, still only 0.6 per cent. However, in Azerbaijan, Indians accounted for a higher percentage of tourists, though it remains less than 10 per cent. In 2017, Indian arrivals made up just 0.5 per cent of foreign visitors there. This increased to 1.4 per cent in 2018 and 2.1 per cent in 2019. This grew further in the following years, reaching 5.6 per cent in 2023 and 9.3 per cent in 2024. Meanwhile, the Shiv Sena is reportedly pressuring the Mumbai International Airport to end its contract with CelebiNAS Airport Services India, a Turkish company responsible for handling a majority of its ground operations."

As India and Pakistan skirmished in the aftermath of Operation Sindoor, the shares of state-run arms makers jumped. Tensions at the border pushed investors toward defence firms, adding billions in market value in just a few days. What's new: India's defence stocks rose sharply after the May 7 military strike on terrorist camps in Pakistan. Why it matters: Investors see defence firms as winners in India's post-strike security and military spending push. In-depth: After India conducted airstrikes on Pakistani terrorist camps on May 7, investors bet that national security concerns and the government's push for defence self-reliance would boost orders for domestic manufacturers. Major state-run arms makers surged. Bharat Dynamics gained over 21 per cent. BEL and Mazagon Dock stocks rose sharply as well. The defence sector remained strong despite market volatility and rising geopolitical tensions. The Nifty India Defence index has risen 9.39 per cent since April 22, outpacing the Nifty 50's 1.98 per cent increase. Bharat Electronics, Hindustan Aeronautics, and Bharat Dynamics added Rs 57,682 crore in market value as of May 13, 2025. The Make in India push is now firmly aligned with military policy.

            "text": "US is the world's second largest steel importer. (Representative Image) India moved to retaliate against the US metal tariffs on Monday. Filing a notice at the World Trade Organisation, India said it would raise duties on select American goods, even as the two countries work to finalise a broader trade deal. What\u2019s new: India has told the WTO it will raise tariffs on US products, reacting to import taxes that have remained in place since March. Why it matters: This is India\u2019s strongest trade response to the US in recent years, and it comes just as Washington DC tries to reset trade ties with China. In-depth: The US first raised these tariffs on Indian steel and aluminium years ago. They were extended again in February and took effect on March 12. India says the US did not follow global trade rules or hold talks before doing so. This trade move comes at a tense time. Earlier this week, the US announced it would cut tariffs on Chinese goods after China refused to raise its own. Markets rose after that decision. But India saw no such relief. Instead, it got another warning. President Trump said in a press briefing that trade with India could depend on its role in talks with Pakistan. \u201cIf you stop it, we\u2019re doing trade. If you don\u2019t stop it, we\u2019re not going to do any trade,\u201d he said. India denied linking trade to foreign policy. Big picture: India stayed quiet on US tariffs for years, even lowering duties on some American products earlier this year, including bourbon whiskey and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. But now, with no sign of US cooperation, India is taking a stronger stand. The next step depends on how Washington, DC responds. What they said: \u201cIndia reserves its right to suspend concessions... equal to the harm caused by U.S. tariffs,\u201d India said in its WTO filing. \u201cIf you stop it, we\u2019re doing trade. If you don\u2019t stop it, we\u2019re not going to do any trade,\u201d said Donald Trump"

Now, both sides have agreed to a 90-day truce, dialling back tariffs as talks resume. However, another trade war began when US President Donald Trump called the European Union \"nastier than China\" on trade issues. What's new: The US and China unexpectedly agreed to slash tariffs and pause their trade war, even as Trump turned his eyes to the EU. After talks in Geneva, the US agreed to cut reciprocal tariffs it imposed on China from 125 per cent to a more digestible 10 per cent for at least 90 days. According to the agreement, US duties on Chinese goods will be lowered from 145 to 30 per cent, while China's retaliatory tariffs on US imports will be reduced from 125 to 10 per cent. Both sides agreed to continue negotiations during the truce. After the trade truce with China, Trump warned that the EU would \"come down a lot\" in trade negotiations, claiming the US has \"all the cards\" due to the significant trade imbalance, particularly in the automotive and agricultural sectors. Why it matters: The US-China tariff deal defused weeks of global market turmoil, but a new threat to Europe could escalate another trade battle. In-depth: Stock markets responded quickly to the US-China tariff pause. The S&P 500 jumped 3.7 per cent, and India's NSE rose 6.1 per cent. Japan's Nikkei surged by over seven per cent. European markets rallied, too, with Germany's DAX gaining 4.7 per cent. Reportedly, Trump said he would speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this week following a dramatic easing of tensions. But hours after announcing the truce, Trump accused the European Union of \"extorting\" drugmakers and warned it was \"in many ways nastier than China.\" That signalled a possible new start to a trade dispute, this time with Europe. The EU is maintaining a substantial trade surplus with the US. In 2024, the EU exported 531.6 billion in goods to the US and imported 333.4 billion, resulting in a surplus of 198.2 billion. However, US data shows a $235.6 billion deficit for the same period. Big picture: US tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods remain at 25 per cent, though some goods are exempt under the USMCA agreement. Most other countries, including the European Union, Japan, Vietnam, and South Korea, now face a flat 10 per cent tariff. India's case stands out. The US had briefly proposed a hike to 26 per cent. But that was never implemented. Instead, India now faces a 10 per cent tariff, the same as many other mid-sized trading partners. The US may try to avoid more tension with India as Asian alliances shift. India has started fighting back against US tariffs on steel and aluminium with its taxes on some American goods. India informed the World Trade Organisation that the US tariffs on these metals are \"safeguard measures\" \u2014 trade restrictions \u2014 that will adversely impact India's trade. What they said: \"No winners in tariff wars or trade wars,\u201d Xi Jinping, the President of China, said."

During the Indian armed forces\u2019 media briefings on Operation Sindoor, two faces stood out: Colonel Sofiya Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh. Both took charge with authority, exuding composure and allaying fears. From the battlefield to the boardroom, Indian women are taking charge, and this change did not happen overnight. Women are taking leadership roles in businesses head-on, steadily claiming spaces once dominated by men across startups. The number of Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade-recognised startups with at least one woman director jumped from just 36 per cent in 2017 to 51 per cent in 2024. States like Maharashtra (14,284), Delhi (8,012), and Karnataka (8,000) have emerged as hubs of female entrepreneurship. This change is also visible in managerial positions. While men continue to hold the larger share of leadership roles in the last decade, the presence of women has been growing steadily. From 2017 to 2025, the number of women in boardrooms doubled, from 4.5 lakh to 9.1 lakh, and their representation in senior management grew from 23,685 to 38,745. Similarly, in other management roles, women increased from 4.3 lakh to 8.8 lakh in 2025. However, women's overall share has increased only slightly in all the roles. These figures tell a story not just of participation but of persistence. Each increase in women's representation is a glass ceiling broken through perseverance and policy. The presence of two women defence officers as spokespersons for Operation Sindoor shows how far we\u2019ve come."

The Day 1 red carpet of the international film festival was replete with the excessive sartorial drama it is known for. Celebrities like Heidi Klum and Chinese actor Wan QianHui unabashedly ditched the new rules as they posed on the prestigious red carpet at the French Riviera in flamboyant outfits.

Voluminous outfits, in particular those with a large train, that hinder the proper flow of traffic of guests and complicate seating in the theatre are not permitted,\u201d the updated guidelines read. The new dress code affected many, including American actress and model Halle Berry, who had to change her outfit at the last minute because of the new rules. \"I had an amazing dress by Gupta (presumably Gaurav Gupta) to wear tonight, and I cannot wear it because the train's too big,\" Berry, who is a festival jury member this year, said at a news conference. However, not many cared about the rules. Heidi Klum was one among them. She turned up wearing a maximalist floral Elie Saab gown that was in direct violation of the festival's new dress code. Chinese actor and influencer Wan QianHui also ignored the new dress code. She wore an all-white strapless gown with a billowing, cloudlike and tiered voluminous skirt. Actress Eva Longoria too turned up clad in a strapless metallic gown with a long black train. Influencer and \u2018Dubai Bling\u2019 star Farhana Bodi too turned up in a sparkling pink gown featuring sculptural ruffles and a flowing petal cape from the label Atelier Zuhra."

            "title": "Can an Open Phone Policy help your relationship or end it?",
            "text": "An open phone policy doesn\u2019t fix insecurity, say experts. (Photo: Generative AI) Ever found yourself getting a little too curious about who your partner is texting late at night? Maybe you've even considered suggesting an open phone policy just to put your mind at ease? If that sounds familiar, you\u2019ll want to keep reading. At a time when our phone literally has it all - calendars, conversations, secrets, screenshots, and sometimes even our emotional lives, it\u2019s no wonder the idea of an \u201copen phone policy\u201d has become a relationship litmus test. But is sharing passwords a sign of love\u2014or the beginning of its slow unravelling? The idea of being able to access each other\u2019s phones sounds simple enough. For some couples, it might work brilliantly because this could mean a symbol of trust, connection, and openness. As counselling psychologist Absy Sam explains, \u201cThere are couples who have complete transparency, they might even share accounts. And others who are okay with keeping things entirely separate. It depends on comfort, not correctness.\u201d Here\u2019s what an open phone policy can offer, according to Absy: Transparency: For some, access eases anxiety and builds trust. Connection: It offers a peek into your partner\u2019s digital world\u2014shared memes, texts, or that work rant they forgot to mention. Reassurance: Especially for those with anxious attachment styles, openness can soothe fears of abandonment. Convenience: With so much of life happening digitally, shared access can actually be functional. So yes, for the right couple in the right emotional space, this policy can be comforting, even bonding. There is a reason why people demand space in a relationship, because that\u2019s a breather. While many may like to share every minute update with their partners, even better if both partners are in line on this, but what happens when one doesn\u2019t want to conform to this idea? That\u2019s a problem in the making. \u201cAssuming that an open phone policy equals transparency is misleading; it often borders on surveillance,\u201d says psychologist and author Aanya Jai. \u201cJust like locking a bathroom door isn\u2019t secrecy but a basic right to privacy, phone access should be a personal choice, not a test of loyalty.\u201d \u201cIn many cases I\u2019ve encountered, infidelity actually tends to surface more often in relationships that already have an open phone policy,\u201d Aanya points out. \u201cPeople who cheat often thrive on the thrill of deceit. It\u2019s not about access. It\u2019s about mindset.\u201d In short: If someone wants to lie, they\u2019ll lie. No lock screen can stop that, and no open phone can prevent it. Besides, what looks like \u201copenness\u201d to one person may feel like surveillance to another. Sam also cautions: \u201cFor someone with a trauma history, especially those who\u2019ve been gaslighted or emotionally controlled, this kind of access can feel threatening. It\u2019s not about hiding something. It\u2019s about preserving a sense of self.\u201d When you feel the need to check your partner\u2019s phone, question yourself \u2013 why? The urge could be because you have been encountering some questionable behaviour, or maybe your partner has been on their phone way more than they used to. There\u2019s always a reason why you may feel the urge to know what they are up to, always. So, confront. An open phone policy doesn\u2019t fix insecurity. It doesn\u2019t replace emotional intimacy. And it certainly can\u2019t substitute for actual communication. \u201cThe phone isn\u2019t the issue,\u201d says Absy. \u201cThe deeper issues lie around fear of abandonment, poor boundaries, or past wounds that haven\u2019t healed. Sometimes, partners check phones obsessively, not out of curiosity, but out of fear. \u2018Am I being replaced?\u2019\u201d Knowing what your partner is up to all the time is not going to help. Instead, both experts agree that the solution lies in emotional safety. Open, non defensive conversations: Talk openly about your doubts, fears, or insecurities. Don\u2019t jump to conclusions, and most importantly, stay away from the blame game. Voluntary sharing: Trust builds in moments when we choose to be transparent. Like saying, \u201cHey, I ran into my ex today, just wanted you to know,\u201d before being asked. Digital boundaries: We often talk about physical boundaries, but no one mentions about the digital ones. Be clear. \u201cI\u2019d prefer not to share my browsing history\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cI\u2019m cheating\u201d\u2014it could mean \u201cI value my space.\u201d And of course, mention the reason if need be. Let trust grow organically: Trust cannot be forced, it\u2019s best if it grows organically. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to barge in through a closed door,\u201d Absy says. \u201cSometimes, it\u2019s about knocking, waiting, and being let in.\u201d"

The international film festival, which has become extremely popular over the years for its star-studded, extravagant red carpet moments, is now likely to miss its trademark drama. No nudity (sheer dresses), no voluminous silhouettes, and not even long trains. All for \u2018decency\u2019 reasons. \u201cFor decency reasons, nudity is prohibited on the red carpet, as well as in any other area of the Festival,\u201d the updated guidelines read.

Some\u2014though not all, we agree\u2014of the most memorable fashion moments featuring Indian celebrities at the prestigious film festival owe their impact to the extravagance. Remember when Deepika Padukone finally shed her \u2018safe style\u2019 image at the Cannes 2018 red carpet, arriving in a elaborate hot pink Ashi Studio gown? With its dramatic ruffles and exaggerated shoulders, the look screamed high-octane glamour. The following year, she made another unforgettable\u2014and widely memed\u2014appearance in an over-the-top tulle green gown by Giambattista Valli. India\u2019s OG Cannes queen, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, has often turned to larger-than-life gowns for her red carpet appearances on the French Riviera. While she began her Cannes journey in sleek, slender silhouettes\u2014and largely stuck to them until 2017\u2014what followed was a steady stream of voluminous, statement-making looks year after year. From her fairytale moment in a pastel blue Michael Cinco ball gown to a regal red Ralph & Russo number, her butterfly-inspired 2018 look (also by Michael Cinco), the dramatic hooded black-and-silver couture gown by Sophie Couture, the floral bouquet-like ensemble by Dolce & Gabbana, to the latest kitschy green-and-silver creation by Falguni Shane Peacock\u2014voluminous silhouettes have remained her signature Cannes style. Influencers like Nancy Tyagi also rely on billowing silhouettes and layers upon layers of ruffles\u2014dramatic enough to practically get lost in\u2014all in a bid to stand out and gain visibility on the red carpet. Even for international celebrities, these newly banned elements (think naked dressing\u2014wearing rather risque ensembles) and elaborate silhouettes have been go-to choices for creating noteworthy red carpet moments. And what if someone decides to ditch the new dressing guidelines? The celebrity would not be allowed to walk the red carpet at all. \u201cThe Festival welcoming teams will be obligated to prohibit red carpet access to anyone not respecting these rules,\u201d says the new update. The growing dominance of fashion over cinema at the Cannes Film Festival is something that sparks debate every year. Despite being one of the most prestigious film festivals in the world, Cannes often makes more headlines for its extravagant red carpet appearances than for the films themselves. Over time, this shift has only become more apparent, with fashion coverage overshadowing the actual films. Furthermore, the increasing presence of influencers and content creators at the festival has only added to this. Fashion stylist Divyak D\u2019Souza, who works with celebrities like Kareena Kapoor Khan and Malaika Arora, admits he\u2019s \u201ca bit on the fence when it comes to dress codes in general,\u201d pointing out that they can sometimes \u201chinder self-expression and experimentation in fashion.\u201d At the same time, he recognises that events like the Cannes Film Festival come with their own set of expectations. \u201cIt\u2019s important to respect the institutional framework of the event one is attending, and to consider the perspective of the organisers and how they envision the festival,\u201d he says. D\u2019Souza feels that, in recent years, the red carpet has begun to eclipse the core purpose of the festival. \u201cAt the end of the day, Cannes is a film festival,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I do feel that, especially over the past few years, the focus has increasingly shifted away from cinema it often seems more like a photo opportunity or fashion parade than a celebration of film.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe this is the platform to be provocative or to wear outfits that are barely there. Nor do I think impractical, overly voluminous ensembles are appropriate when you're simply attending a film screening,\u201d D\u2019Souza tells India Today. One cannot, however, entirely overlook the role of major fashion and lifestyle brands that sponsor the festival and have their celebrity ambassadors walk the red carpet. This year, for instance, L\u2019Oreal, Chopard, and Kering are once again among the top sponsors. The new dress code revelation right before the film festival kick-starts may have left many celebrities and their stylists on edge, especially if they were planning on wearing voluminous or risqu sheer ensembles. That said, the Cannes red carpet is also known for its rebellious fashion moments. Remember Heelgate? The term dates back to 2015, when 50 women were denied access to the Cannes red carpet for not wearing heels. In 2016, Julia Roberts went barefoot, and Kristen Stewart wore flats. In 2018, when Stewart was a jury member, she made a bolder move by walking up the stairs barefoot. So, you never know there might still be some naked dresses, long trains, and that hearty dose of drama that the Cannes red carpet is known for!"

            "title": "Obsessed with probiotics? You might be missing the whole prebiotic plot",
            "text": "Probiotics vs prebiotics: Which one should you choose for pristine gut health? (Photo: Generative AI) Yogurt, kimchi, kombucha, kefir \u2013 you know what they have in common? Most of you will get the answer right: they\u2019re brimming with probiotics, the so-called gut-friendly bacteria that have become the poster child of modern wellness. The narrative around probiotics (or let\u2019s say, the marketing) is so strong that now, it has become several brands\u2019 go-to excuse for you to get their products in your hands. Even social media has cemented them as a daily essential for better digestion, glowing skin, immunity, and beyond. But amid the hullaballoo around probiotics and their importance in keeping our gut condition pristine, are we missing the real plot? \u201cProbiotics are live microorganisms that can offer health benefits, but only when consumed in adequate amounts,\u201d says Dietician Vidhi Chawla, founder of FISICO Diet and Aesthetic Clinic. \u201cThey\u2019re essentially good bacteria that can help balance your gut microbiome\u2014found in fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, and sauerkraut.\u201d But here\u2019s the catch: simply introducing these bacteria into your system doesn\u2019t guarantee they\u2019ll survive the journey through your stomach\u2019s acidic environment. That\u2019s where prebiotics come in, the often-forgotten fibre-rich fuel that your existing gut bacteria need to thrive. \u201cThink of them as fertiliser,\u201d says Chawla. \u201cThey\u2019re non-digestible fibres that pass through the upper digestive tract intact and get fermented in the colon, feeding the good bacteria already living in your gut.\u201d Unlike probiotics, prebiotics aren\u2019t fragile. They\u2019re found in everyday foods, bananas (especially the slightly green ones), garlic, onions, oats, barley, legumes, flaxseeds, and they\u2019re not destroyed by digestion. While Dr. Kiran B, Consultant - Gastroenterologist, Manipal Hospital, Varthur Road, Bengaluru, doesn\u2019t deny that probiotics have become the wellness industry's darling, she raises a few questions. \u201cWalk through any supermarket aisle and you\u2019ll find everything from yogurt to granola bars boasting \u2018live cultures\u2019 or \u2018gut-friendly bacteria.\u2019 While it\u2019s a compelling marketing hook, we need to ask \u2014 is this science or just sales?\u201d she questions. Chawla says that the obsession with probiotics isn\u2019t entirely unfounded, but it\u2019s just incomplete. \u201cThe idea of directly introducing \u2018good\u2019 bacteria is appealing and easily marketable, but many probiotic products lack strong scientific backing. The strains and doses vary, and survival in the gut is inconsistent,\u201d she adds. What\u2019s worse is that some products boast probiotic content but don\u2019t list actual strains or colony counts. That\u2019s like buying a mystery pill and hoping for the best. The truth is, many of the probiotics consumed through food or supplements don\u2019t actually survive the harsh acidity of the stomach. These fragile strains may not reach the intestines in adequate numbers to make a meaningful difference. This raises another question: are we focusing too much on adding bacteria instead of nourishing the beneficial bacteria we already have? Despite all the discussion in favour of prebiotics, probiotics are still important, but with caveats. Dr. Aasima Boxwalla, associate consultant - surgical gastroenterology, GI and HPB Oncology at Manipal Hospital, explains, \u201cProbiotics break down prebiotics to produce beneficial metabolites like short-chain fatty acids. These metabolites trigger the release of peptides that help protect against conditions like IBD, allergies, even some cancers, while also strengthening the gut barrier function.\u201d So no, probiotics aren\u2019t a scam, but they are often misunderstood and overhyped. Now, the important question is \u2013 what does your body really want? Well, a combination of both, known in scientific circles as synbiotics. \u201cPrebiotics alone can be incredibly beneficial because they feed and support the good bacteria already present in your gut,\u201d says Dr. Boxwalla. \u201cBut pairing them with probiotics creates a synergistic effect.\u201d It\u2019s not as complicated as it sounds. Think: yogurt with banana, buttermilk with oats, or kimchi with a lentil salad. This combo not only introduces helpful bacteria but ensures they\u2019ve got something to feed on once they arrive. Here\u2019s your prebiotic-rich starter pack, straight from the experts: These are all prebiotic foods, they don\u2019t contain live bacteria, but they help the good ones in your gut thrive. Chawla recommends aiming for variety, \u201cTry to include multiple types of plant-based, fibre-rich foods each day. This diversity feeds different species of bacteria, helping your microbiome stay balanced and resilient.\u201d"

Operation Sindoor was in response to the Pahalgam terror attack where 26 people \u2013 mostly tourists \u2013 were killed by terrorists after asking their religion. On May 7, India launched Operation Sindoor and struck nine terror bases in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Muridke was one of the sites that was targeted during the operation. The main targets of the strikes were the jihadist structures of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Toiba, the two terrorist organisations responsible for major attacks on Indian soil over the past three decades. Located about 33 km from Lahore on the historic Grand Trunk Road, Muridke hosts the headquarters of the Lashkar-e-Toiba. Called the Markaz-e-Toiba, the LeT headquarter operates under the facade of a charitable organisation, Jammat-ud_Dawa.

Where are the ingredients of the offence?\u201d Observing that the FIR lacked any material that could constitute a cognisable offence, the court remarked that it had been \u201cdrafted in such a way that it can be quashed.\u201d The bench added, \u201cThere is nothing in the FIR.\u201d In the interest of justice, the High Court said the investigation shall be closely monitored. \u201cThe FIR is to be amended to include the entirety of the High Court's earlier order in Para 12 \u2014 all details of actions by Vijay Shah are to be mentioned clearly.\" The court reiterated, \u201cThere has to be a cognisable offence,\u201d and asked, \u201cWhere are the contents of those offences?\u201d It further said, \u201cThis FIR can easily be quashed.\u201d When the counsel admitted to not drafting the FIR, the court retorted, \u201cObviously you have not drafted it!\u201d The counsel submitted that the entire High Court order had been attached to the FIR, to which the court said, \u201cIt was registered last night but the content must be there in the FIR.

The court, however, remarked, \u201cThe intention is apparent from the act. The act shows that the contents of the FIR are not there.\u201d The minister had approached the Supreme Court for relief a day after the Madhya Pradesh High Court ordered an FIR against him for \u201chate speech\u201d against Army\u2019s Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, A case has also been registered against Shah in Indore under relevant sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). The case was registered in compliance with a high court order, which called the minister's remarks \"disparaging and dangerous\". This came despite Vijay Shah issuing an unconditional apology for his remarks, which sparked nationwide outrage and drew flak from all quarters. \"I am not only ashamed and saddened by my statement but sincerely apologise from the bottom of my heart,\" Vijay Shah said in a video statement. The development came a day after Shah, while speaking at a government event, had said that the Prime Minister had sent a \"sister from the same community\" as those in Pakistan to avenge the April 22 terror attack in Kashmir\u2019s Pahalgam. \"Modi ji is striving for society. Those who widowed our daughters [in Pahalgam], we sent a sister of their own to teach them a lesson,\" he said."

The top court also passed a directive to all states and union territories to probe if any forest land was allotted to any private parties for non-forest activities. \"Chief secretaries to ensure that all land with state governments and union territories which are forest land be handed over to the forest department. If the land has become non-forest by conversion, then let an adequate amount be calculated for afforestation,\" observed the Supreme Court. \"Reserved forest land cannot be assigned by lease by state authorities to any person/entity without prior approval of the centre,\" the bench added. The case pertains to the allotment of 11.86 acres of forest land in Pune's Kondhwa Budruk by the Maharasthra revenue department to Richie Rich Colony -- despite resistance from the forest department. The Court said that the environmental clearance given to the Richie Rich Colony was illegal."

            "text": "The Supreme Court on Thursday came down heavily on Madhya Pradesh BJP Minister Kunwar Vijay Shah over his remarks against Indian Army officer Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, refusing to intervene in the FIR lodged against him for now. A day after the Madhya Pradesh High Court ordered an FIR against BJP Minister Kunwar Vijay Shah for \u201chate speech\u201d against Army\u2019s Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, the minister had approached the Supreme Court for relief. In a plea filed late night on Wednesday, Shah has sought stay on the High Court order, on grounds that his statement has been \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d. During the urgent mentioning of Shah\u2019s plea challenging the Madhya Pradesh High Court\u2019s May 14 order directing the registration of an FIR, Chief Justice of India (CJI) BR Gavai, heading the bench, said, \u201cA person holding constitutional office is expected to act responsibly. What kind of statements is he making? Is it appropriate for a minister to make such statements?\u201d The High Court had initiated suo motu action against Shah for calling Colonel Qureshi a \u201csister of terrorists,\u201d describing his comments as \u201cscurrilous\u201d and \u201clanguage of the gutters.\u201d Shah\u2019s counsel told the Supreme Court that the minister had apologised, expressed remorse, and that his statement was distorted and hyped by the media. \u201cHe has expressed remorse, and his statements have been misunderstood,\u201d the counsel submitted. However, the CJI observed, \u201cEvery sentence uttered by a person in such a position is heard, especially when the country is going through a sensitive situation.\u201d He added, \u201cYou know who you are nothing will happen in 24 hours.\u201d The court did not pass any stay order on the FIR but agreed to hear the matter on Friday (May 16). A case has also been registered against Shah in Indore under relevant sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). The case was registered in compliance with a high court order, which called the minister's remarks \"disparaging and dangerous\". This came despite Vijay Shah issuing an unconditional apology for his remarks, which sparked nationwide outrage and drew flak from all quarters. \"I am not only ashamed and saddened by my statement but sincerely apologise from the bottom of my heart,\" Vijay Shah said in a video statement. The development came a day after Shah, while speaking at a government event, had said that the Prime Minister had sent a \"sister from the same community\" as those in Pakistan to avenge the April 22 terror attack in Kashmir\u2019s Pahalgam. \"Modi ji is striving for society. Those who widowed our daughters [in Pahalgam], we sent a sister of their own to teach them a lesson,\" he said. Shah's controversial remarks also provided political ammunition to the Congress, whose national president Mallikarjun Kharge called the comment \"insulting, shameful and vulgar\u201d, and demanded his immediate dismissal. During the hearing in the Madhya Pradesh High Court on Thursday, the court strongly criticised the state police over the manner in which the FIR was registered against BJP Minister Kunwar Vijay Shah. The bench questioned the FIR's substance, asking, \u201cIs this it? Have you read the FIR? Where are the ingredients of the offence?\u201d Observing that the FIR lacked any material that could constitute a cognisable offence, the court remarked that it had been \u201cdrafted in such a way that it can be quashed.\u201d The bench added, \u201cThere is nothing in the FIR.\u201d When the counsel admitted to not drafting the FIR, the court retorted, \u201cObviously you have not drafted it!\u201d The counsel submitted that the entire High Court order had been attached to the FIR, to which the court said, \u201cIt was registered last night but the content must be there in the FIR. If you have annexed the order, it will be read as part of the FIR.\u201d The court reiterated, \u201cThere has to be a cognisable offence,\u201d and questioned, \u201cWhere are the contents of those offences?\u201d It further said, \u201cThis FIR can easily be quashed.\u201d Responding to the court's observations, the Advocate General said, \u201cWe will act as the court directs, while the counsel requested the bench not to assume that they were protecting the accused. The court, however, remarked, \u201cThe intention is apparent from the act. The act shows that the contents of the FIR are not there.\u201d"

            "text": "At a time when the gap between the judiciary and the executive is widening, Justice BR Gavai, who was sworn in as the country's top-ranking judicial officer on Wednesday, will face several pressing questions to begin with -- from setting a timeline for the Governor and President\u2019s assent to bills, to the use of the Supreme Court\u2019s extraordinary powers under Article 142 to deliver complete justice. The newly sworn-in Chief Justice of India (CJI), BR Gavai, faces his first challenge in addressing the President's question on whether the Supreme Court can set a timeline for governors and the President, as observed by a two-judge bench in a landmark judgment in the Tamil Nadu Governor case. The President has used the powers conferred under Article 143 of the Constitution to seek advice on the Supreme Court's decision in the landmark Tamil Nadu governor judgement, with President Droupadi Murmu asking the top court: How can Supreme Court put a timeline when the Constitution does not?\" Chief Justice of India Gavai will now be required to set up a Constitution bench -- comprising five or more judges -- to provide an opinion to the 14 questions posed by President Droupadi Murmu. India Today TV has accessed the list of questions that were posed by President Murmu on Tuesday, day before Chief Justice of India Gavai took oath. Listed below are all the 14 questions referred to the Supreme Court: 1. What are the constitutional options before a Governor when a Bill is presented to him under Article 200 of the Constitution of India? 2. Is the Governor bound by the aid & advice tendered by the Council of Ministers while exercising all the options available with him when a Bill is presented before him under Article 200 of the Constitution of India? 3. Is the exercise of constitutional discretion by the Governor under Article 200 of the Constitution of India justiciable? 4. Is Article 361 of the Constitution of India an absolute bar to the judicial review in relation to the actions of a Governor under Article 200 of the Constitution of India? 5. In the absence of a constitutionally prescribed time limit, and the manner of exercise of powers by the Governor, can timelines be imposed and the manner of exercise be prescribed through judicial orders for the exercise of all powers under Article 200 of the Constitution of India by the Governor? 6. Is the exercise of constitutional discretion by the President under Article 201 of the Constitution of India justiciable? 7. In the absence of a constitutionally prescribed timeline and the manner of exercise of powers by the President, can timelines be imposed and the manner of exercise be prescribed through judicial orders for the exercise of discretion by the President under Article 201 of the Constitution of India? 8. In light of the constitutional scheme governing the powers of the President, is the President required to seek advice of the Supreme Court by way of a reference under Article 143 of the Constitution of India and take the opinion of the Supreme Court when the Governor reserves a Bill for the President's assent or otherwise? 9. Are the decisions of the Governor and the President under Article 200 and Article 201 of the Constitution of India, respectively, justiciable at a stage anterior into the law coming into force? Is it permissible for the Courts to undertake judicial adjudication over the contents of a Bill, in any manner, before it becomes law? 10. Can the exercise of constitutional powers and the orders of/by the President / Governor be substituted in any manner under Article 142 of the Constitution of India? 11. Is a law made by the State legislature a law in force without the assent of the Governor granted under Article 200 of the Constitution of India? 12. In view of the proviso to Article 145(3) of the Constitution of India, is it not mandatory for any bench of this Hon'ble Court to first decide as to whether the question involved in the proceedings before it is of such a nature which involves substantial questions of law as to the interpretation of constitution and to refer it to a bench of minimum five Judges? 13. Do the powers of the Supreme Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India limited to matters of procedural law or Article 142 of the Constitution of India extends to issuing directions /passing orders which are contrary to or inconsistent with existing substantive or procedural provisions of the Constitution or law in force? 14. Does the Constitution bar any other jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to resolve disputes between the Union Government and the State Governments except by way of a suit under Article 131 of the Constitution of India? Last month, the Vice President of India, Jagdeep Dhankhar, questioned the Supreme Court's use of its extraordinary powers under Article 142 to set a deadline for both the President and the Governor, and cleared 10 bills passed by the Tamil Nadu Assembly without the Executive's nod, calling it a case of \"judicial overreach.\" On April 12, the top court, in a first, ruled that the President must take a decision on the bills reserved by the Governor within three months. The bench observed that the powers of the President under Article 201 were subject to judicial review, thus setting the cat among the pigeons."

            "title": "Obesity in Indian women is a growing crisis, starting as early as age 18",
            "text": "Obesity is increasing and affecting younger women, including those planning pregnancies. (Photo: Getty Images) Indian women are increasingly being affected by obesity, and this is starting early in life, doctors warn. In fact, recent data shows that more than half of women aged 18-30 are already overweight, a trend that experts say demands immediate public health attention. A new consensus statement published in the Indian Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology Research has raised concerns about the rising burden of obesity among women, especially in the reproductive age group. Led by Dr. Nandita Palshetkar from Mumbai\u2019s Lilavati Hospital, along with 11 other specialists from across India, the study puts forward clear clinical recommendations on how doctors should assess and manage obesity among Indian women, with specific guidance for those planning a pregnancy. According to the report, the problem of obesity is not limited to urban or affluent women. In fact, the National Family Health Survey-5 (2019\u201321) found that 33.2% of urban women and 19.7% of rural women in India are overweight or obese (defined as BMI of more than 25 kg/m2). The numbers climb sharply with age. A study of over 6.4 lakh Indian women found that nearly 49% of those aged 35-49 were overweight or obese. In the 18\u201330 age group, another study revealed that more than half, 52.4%, were already obese. \"The trends are very clear. Obesity is increasing and affecting younger women, including those planning pregnancies. We need urgent action, at the clinical and public health level,\" the paper states. From PCOS to stillbirths, how obesity affects women\u2019s health Obesity in women is linked to a wide range of health complications, some of them unique to women. These include: Doctors say these effects begin early, from puberty, and continue through menopause. Obesity also worsens conditions like depression, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women. The consensus calls on gynaecologists and primary care physicians to routinely assess BMI, waist circumference, and lifestyle factors in women during check-ups \u2014 especially if they are planning to conceive. Why losing 5\u201310% body weight can make a big difference Women with PCOS who lost weight reported: In addition, weight loss improves urinary incontinence, mobility, and mental health, enhancing overall quality of life. \u201cBy managing obesity early, ideally before conception, we can significantly improve fertility outcomes and reduce risks during pregnancy. Our aim is to help women make small, sustainable lifestyle changes, which can go a long way in protecting maternal, fetal and child health,\u201d said lead author Dr Nanditha Palshetkar, Medical Director, Bloom IVF Lilavati hospital. What works: Diet, exercise, therapy, and when needed, medicines When lifestyle changes alone are not enough, doctors may consider medication for women with BMI more than 27 and a related health condition, or BMI more than 30. Currently, Orlistat is available in India. Semaglutide (2.4 mg) has been approved by the drug regulator but is not yet available in the Indian market. These drugs have shown significant weight-loss effects in clinical trials, alongside improvements in hormone levels and fertility parameters. However, they are not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Bariatric surgery is an option, but only for some For women with BMI more than 35 or those with serious health complications, bariatric surgery may be considered. The procedure has been linked to rapid weight loss, improved fertility, better hormone levels, and reduced risks during pregnancy. However, conception is advised only after a 12-month waiting period post-surgery. Weight gain during pregnancy should be monitored and tailored to BMI categories, while postpartum weight management should involve structured programs aiming for a weight loss of 0.5 kg/week. \"Breastfeeding should be encouraged, and anti-obesity medications may only be considered after cessation of breastfeeding. For perimenopausal and post-menopausal women, evaluating muscle mass, bone health, and screening for metabolic disorders is crucial before implementing weight management strategies,\u201d said study co-author Dr. Piya Ballani Thakkar, an endocrinologist specialising in diabetes and metabolic disorders. Obesity among Indian women is not just about body image, it's a serious medical issue with long-term health consequences. The ISAR-led recommendations provide a much-needed roadmap for doctors to screen, manage, and treat obesity more effectively."

            "title": "Endometriosis can start as early as age 10: Here's why that matters",
            "text": "The average delay in diagnosing endometriosis is 7 to 10 years globally. (Photo: Getty Images) Endometriosis, a disease too commonly misunderstood as a problem only in adult women, can start much earlier, sometimes at 10 or 12 years of age. This condition happens when the tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. It depends on the female hormone called estrogen, according to Dr. Smeet Patel, Endometriosis Specialist, Mayflower Women\u2019s Hospital, Ahmedabad. Since estrogen secretion starts at around the time of menarche (the onset of the first period in a girl), endometriosis can arise precisely at the time of puberty onset. This phase of a young girl's life is characterised by a burst of hormonal activity, causing significant physical, emotional, and psychological changes. The body begins to prepare for menstruation even before the onset of the first period by secreting hormones, which can lead to fluctuations and imbalances. These hormonal changes are frequently accompanied by pain or discomfort, but not all pain should be ignored as normal. Endometriosis can manifest with symptoms like pelvic pain, painful menstruation, gastrointestinal discomfort, fatigue, or low energy. Mild discomfort during the initial few cycles is usual, but severe pain lasting more than six months or affecting daily life might be a cause for concern. A 2021 study published in the Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology found that over 60% of women with endometriosis reported experiencing symptoms during adolescence, but diagnosis was often delayed by years. The catch? Even imaging tests such as ultrasounds and MRIs may reveal normal readings, particularly with early-stage disease. This typically results in delayed diagnosis, where pain is normalised or ignored. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the average delay in diagnosing endometriosis is 7 to 10 years globally, which often means that crucial years for early intervention and support are lost. Two widely debated hypotheses describe how endometriosis could develop. One is retrograde menstruation, whereby menstrual blood flows backwards through the fallopian tubes and into the pelvic cavity and permits endometrial cells to implant and become established outside the uterus. The second is the embryonic Mullerian cell theory, which suggests that during fetal development, some Mullerian cells fail to leave the body as they normally should. Instead, they remain and later develop into tissue similar to the lining of the uterus (endometrium). Both of these hypotheses predict that endometriosis may become apparent at an early age. Early detection is important, not just to treat the pain but also to halt the progression of disease and preserve fertility. The Endometriosis UK charity reports that delayed diagnosis is one of the top contributors to poor quality of life and increased mental health issues among patients. Certain girls are enduring a lot of pain during their periods. For the first 2\u20133 years, if there is immense pain, then it may possibly be something that needs to be checked,\" said Dr. Patel. A gynecologist can help determine if symptoms arise due to puberty, endometriosis, or other health conditions such as PCOS. PCOS, OBESITY, AND OTHER HORMONAL RED FLAGS IN TEENS Notably, early symptoms of PCOS and obesity-induced hormonal problems can also appear during adolescence. With timely intervention, by way of lifestyle modifications such as exercise or diet changes, these can often be reversed. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, lifestyle changes during adolescence can significantly improve symptoms in both PCOS and early-stage endometriosis. Routine check-ups provide young girls with the necessary advice, not only on coping with symptoms, but also on menstrual hygiene, identifying abnormal patterns, and even on preventive treatments such as the HPV vaccine. Education and early screening can bridge the diagnostic gap that so many girls currently fall through. Adolescence is a defining moment for reproductive health. Educating girls about conditions like endometriosis and encouraging early medical help empowers them to understand their bodies, seek timely care, and take charge of their future."

            "text": "Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk said it agrees \"that Americans need more access to affordable medication, and we will continue to engage with policymakers.\" (Photo: Getty Images) The Trump administration on Monday singled out powerful new weight-loss drugs including Wegovy and Zepbound as targets in its push to lower prescription drug prices. President Donald Trump's executive order demands that drugmakers cut prices on their products in the coming months to hew more closely to what they charge in other developed countries, or face new regulations and enforcement actions, from export restrictions to tariffs. At the signing ceremony, Trump described a conversation with a businessman friend who lamented how much more expensive weight-loss treatments are in the United States. \"'I'm in London, and I just paid for this damn fat drug I take,'\" Trump quoted the man as saying. \"'I just paid $88 and in New York I paid $1,300. What the hell is going on? ... It's the same box made in the same plant by the same company.'\" He didn\u2019t name the medicine. Injected weight-loss drugs Wegovy, from Novo Nordisk, and Eli Lilly's Zepbound have U.S. list prices of over $1,000 a month. For some patients, much of that cost is covered by health insurance. For those without coverage, both Novo and Lilly recently began selling their drugs directly to U.S. consumers at a cash price of $499 a month. But with 40% of Americans estimated to have obesity, U.S. politicians and healthcare experts have urged both companies to make the treatments more affordable. A White House official told reporters on Monday that Trump's executive order will have \"a particular focus on drugs where there is the largest disparities and the largest expenditures.\" \"It would be fair to expect that GLP-1s, given that they hit both of those categories, will be a focus,\" the official said, referring to the class of drugs for weight loss that Wegovy and Zepbound, as well as related diabetes medicines Ozempic and Mounjaro, belong to. \"There will be an expectation that those prices should come down, and then if they don't, that we will be looking at our various policy levers that can be used to force those prices down.\" Lilly on Monday said it agreed that costs for breakthrough medicines should be shared more fairly across developed countries. But the Indianapolis-based drugmaker said that could only happen if intermediaries within the U.S. healthcare system, such as pharmacy benefit managers, take a smaller share of sales transactions. Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk said it agrees \"that Americans need more access to affordable medication, and we will continue to engage with policymakers.\" Countries where health insurance is mainly provided by the government often negotiate lower prices with pharmaceutical companies. In Japan, for instance, the monthly price for a 10 milligram Zepbound injection pen is $61.68. The trade-off is that some drugs are not covered under the government-run plans. In the UK, access to the new obesity drugs within the National Health Service is very limited, while Germany\u2019s health plan does not cover the medications for weight loss. \"These drug pricing issues resonate for a lot of people on GLP-1s,\" said Benedic Ippolito, a senior fellow in economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. Many U.S. patients had also come to rely on much cheaper copycat versions of GLP-1s made by compounding pharmacies, a practice that will soon come to an end under a crackdown by the Food and Drug Administration now that the brand name medicines are no longer in shortage."

            "text": "The procedure uses sound waves to focus on a specific part of the brain. (Photo: Getty Images) Patients suffering from Parkinson\u2019s tremors might find relief as doctors have used a non-surgical method to treat the condition. Doctors at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in New Delhi treated a patient successfully using a method called MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS). According to the experts, this is the first time this method has been used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease in North India. Parkinson\u2019s disease is a brain condition that affects how a person moves. It happens when certain nerve cells in the brain that produce a chemical called dopamine begin to break down or die. Dopamine helps control smooth and balanced movement, so when its levels drop, a person can have trouble moving normally. Common symptoms of the condition include tremors (shaking), especially in the hands, stiff muscles, slowed movements, balance and coordination problems, and small handwriting or changes in speech. Reema (name changed), a retired schoolteacher, had been battling severe hand tremors for years. These tremors made everyday tasks like drinking water, eating, or writing nearly impossible. When she was advised to undergo Deep Brain Stimulation, a complicated brain surgery, she was terrified and chose to continue living with the problem. That changed when she learned about a new non-invasive treatment available in Delhi. Initially considering travelling to the UK for the procedure, Reema was relieved to find the same technology here in India. She underwent the MRgFUS procedure, conducted by Dr. Anshu Rohatgi, Vice Chairman of Neurology, and saw results immediately. Her right hand stopped shaking during the treatment itself. MRgFUS is a modern treatment that doesn\u2019t require any cuts or implants. It works by using focused sound waves to target the exact part of the brain causing the tremors. The procedure is done using an MRI, which ensures high accuracy. It is especially useful for people with Essential Tremors (a common neurological disorder) and Parkinson\u2019s Disease where shaking is the main symptom. \u201cThis is a completely non-invasive technique, so patients avoid the risks of open surgery and recover faster,\u201d said Dr. Satnam Chhabra, Chairman of Neurosurgery. \u201cThis is part of our ongoing effort to bring the latest technology to our patients. For those who don\u2019t respond to medicines, this treatment offers a new lease on life,\u201d Dr. Ajay Swaroop, Chairman of the hospital\u2019s Board of Management, said."

Sharing this video, an X user wrote, \u201cTraitors supporting Pakistan and raising 'Pakistan Zindabad' slogans serviced and paraded by Bhopal Police.\u201d India Today Fact Check found that the viral video shows gangster Zubair Maulana's arrest by the Bhopal Police after he was seen using firearms in a public place. Reverse-searching key frames from the viral video led us to a news report uploaded to YouTube on May 12. Per the report, notorious gangster Zubair Maulana and three of his associates were arrested by the Bhopal Police. Over 55 criminal cases have been registered against him. He was accused of vandalising vehicles and firing guns in public to create panic in Bhopal. The police recovered illegal firearms and other weapons from them. We found several news reports about this incident. Per the Free Press Journal, the operation was carried out on May 8, jointly by police teams from Mangalwara, Tila Jamalpura, the Crime Branch, and Hanumanganj. Zubair Maulana had been absconding since October 2024. He was accused of triggering violence and shooting in public places to scare rivals in Bhopal\u2019s Mangalwara and Tila Jamalpura areas on May 6. We did not find any mention of Pakistan or \u201cPakistan Zindabad\u201d slogans in any news report. To confirm this, we contacted the SHO of Mangalwara police station, Ajay Kumar Soni. Speaking to India Today Fact Check, Soni refuted the viral claim that the police arrested these people for chanting \u201cPakistan Zindabad\u201d. He confirmed that the arrests were made on May 8, because he and his aides started firing guns in public. Thus, it\u2019s clear that this video does not show people beaten up for saying \u201cPakistan Zindabad\u201d in India. Want to send us something for verification?

            "title": "Half clips, full lies: How Pak used doctored news videos to push their propaganda",
            "text": "Showing the full story would have revealed the truth. So, the Pakistan Army chose to pick up news reports, including AajTak\u2019s, and carved out portions from them to present to the press and the international community. Shockingly, this was done by none other than Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). In a press briefing on May 11, he explained how Operation Bunyan Marsoos met all the objectives set out by Pakistan. As evidence, he showed clips of national and international news reports about cross-border airstrikes by India and Pakistan. However, not only did the Pakistan Army clip these reports to paint a false picture of its military might, but it also omitted parts of the same reports that didn\u2019t suit its narrative. Here are two such news reports that Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry twisted during the press conference: Chaudhry showed an AajTak clip, claiming the news anchor stated that Indians were panicking as their armed forces could not protect airbases from Pakistan\u2019s airstrikes. The anchor could be heard saying, \u201cThere is a visible sense of panic among people because all the airbases appear to be under attack, they look like they\u2019re engulfed in flames. The biggest concern being discussed is if you cannot protect your airbases, how will you protect the public?\u201d The original news report, however, showed quite the opposite. In it, a video shared by the Indian Army showing Pakistani airbases being targeted by India was first shown. The report begins with correspondent Jitendra Bahadur Singh explaining how India attacked Pakistan\u2019s launch pads, airbases, and critical military assets, while Pakistan used civilian flights as shields. The news anchor, Shashi Tushar Sharma, then elaborated on how people in Pakistan were panicking amid these attacks, questioning how Pakistan would save its civilians when it couldn\u2019t save its airbases. You can see the original news broadcast below. Another such \u201cevidence\u201d used by the Pakistan Army was a news report by Al Jazeera, in which journalist Umar Mehraj stated that a series of loud explosions were heard across Jammu and Kashmir just after morning prayers on May 10. We found an Al Jazeera news report dated May 10, featuring Mehraj\u2019s bite. In it, he reported that a series of loud explosions were heard across Jammu and Kashmir, including in Jammu, Nagrota, Uri, and Srinagar. However, right after this, he added that whether these blasts were caused by a Pakistani airstrike or India\u2019s air defence systems intercepting the airstrikes remained unclear. He also added how Pakistani shelling in Jammu Kashmir\u2019s Rajouri killed \u201ca senior government official\u201d, referring to Additional District Development Commissioner Raj Kumar Thappa. The Pakistan Army, however, omitted these parts completely from the video shown at the presser. If splicing media reports was not enough, the Pakistan Army also doctored Wing Commander Vyomika Singh\u2019s statement from the official Indian Armed Forces press briefing of May 10. A detailed report about it can be read here."

            "text": "Pakistani propaganda through proxy accounts to target India is now well-known. However, Pakistan has now taken the disinformation campaign to an entirely new level. Even during a military conflict, one does not expect a top-ranking army officer in uniform to conduct an official press conference and present doctored clips to prove a point. You don\u2019t expect to hear \u201cquotes\u201d that have been manufactured by picking up random parts of a sentence in a manner that distorts its meaning. But that\u2019s exactly what happened on Sunday night, May 11, when Ahmed Shareef Chaudhry, the Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the Pakistan Armed Forces media wing, addressed the press on its Operation Bunyan Marsoos. During the presser, he played a clip of Wing Commander Vyomika Singh of the Indian Air Force, who, alongside Colonel Sofiya Qureshi of the Indian Army, became the face of Operation Sindoor. The clip was from a press briefing a day earlier on May 10. Ahmed Shareef Chaudhry wanted to prove through the press conference that Pakistan only targeted military installations, not civilian areas. However, what he presented as evidence was a video of Vyomika Singh stitched together from various sentences. If you look carefully, you can see several jump-cuts throughout the video. Every time the continuity breaks, there's a jump-cut, suggesting editing. Here are four instances which make it amply clear how heavily Vyomika Singh\u2019s statements were twisted and distorted. The Pakistan Army removed the words \u201ccivilian areas\u201d from Vyomika Singh\u2019s statement to make it look like they attacked only military bases. They removed the part where Vyomika Singh says the Pakistani attacks were neutralised. They created a whole new sentence by picking up words from various sentences. They dropped all mention of the Pakistani armed forces targeting civilian areas, Pakistan\u2019s disinformation campaign, and targets hit by Indian armed forces. They chose to omit the part where Vyomika Singh countered Pakistan\u2019s claims of destroying Indian airbases in Punjab and Rajasthan. You can see the original Indian press conference right here. And you can see the Pakistani press conference here."

            "text": "With the announcement of a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, let\u2019s look at some of the key items in Pakistan\u2019s disinformation campaign in the run-up to the dtente. The campaign provides an insight into what might have been on Pakistan\u2019s agenda against India amid its slew of unsuccessful air raids. Pakistan-based accounts attempted to cause infighting in India through their disinformation campaign. They shared a video of many people gathered on a farm, and claimed that Sikhs in India had turned against the Indian Army in Amritsar. The video, however, predates the recent India-Pakistan military escalations that began with India\u2019s Operation Sindoor on May 7. Of course, India\u2019s covert operation was in retaliation against the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack. The video actually shows a clash between the police and protesters over a biogas plant in Ludhiana\u2019s Akhara village on April 26. Pakistan-based accounts overwhelmingly spread lies about an Indian Air Force pilot called Shivangi Singh getting captured across the border. Of course, that\u2019s untrue. For starters, the Press Information Bureau, while referring to a separate video shared with the claim, refuted this outright. It said that an Indian female Air Force pilot \u201chas NOT been captured\u201d. Indian Female Air Force pilot has NOT been captured Pro-Pakistan social media handles claim that an Indian Female Air Force pilot, Squadron Leader Shivani Singh, has been captured in Pakistan.#PIBFactCheck This claim is FAKE!#IndiaFightsPropaganda@MIB_India pic.twitter.com/V8zovpSRYk\u2014 PIB Fact Check (@PIBFactCheck) May 10, 2025 \u201cEven Bollywood can\u2019t deliver such action that the Pakistan Air Force did in real life to India,\u201d wrote Pakistan-based accounts, as they shared a video of a fighter jet doing some rather impressive flying. This video also predates Operation Sindoor and the subsequent skirmishes between India and Pakistan. It was shared by a YouTube account on April 30."

            "title": "Supreme Court rejects 100% VVPAT-EVM verification: 'Need culture of trust'",
            "text": "The Supreme Court also rejected a demand to go back to ballot papers. The Supreme Court on Friday rejected all the petitions seeking the complete verification of votes cast using Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) with Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips. A two-judge bench comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta also rejected a demand to go back to ballot papers in elections. \"We rejected all pleas related to bringing ballot papers again.\" Justice Khanna said at the hearing. During the hearing, the bench said that it gave the Election Commission of India (ECI) two directions. \"One direction is after the completion of the symbol loading process, the Symbol Loading Unit (SLU) should be sealed. The SLU should be stored at least for a period of 45 days,\" it said. \"The burnt memory in the microcontroller EVM shall be checked by a team of engineers after the declaration of results on a request by candidates in serial numbers 2 and 3. Such a request has to be made within seven days after the declaration of results.\" Justice Khanna further asked the poll body to examine the suggestion for an electronic machine for vote counting the paper slips and whether along with the symbol there can be a bar code for each party. Justice Khanna said the \"expenses for the verification (of the program) to be borne by the candidates making the request, in case the EVM is found to be tampered, the expenses will be refunded\". \"Blindly distrusting a system can lead to unwarranted suspicions,\" Justice Datta said, adding, \"democracy is all about maintaining harmony and trust among all the pillars\". On April 18, the court had reserved its judgement on the petitions after a two-day hearing, and on Wednesday, it asked the ECI to provide clarification on five of its queries regarding the functioning of EVMs. During the hearing on Wednesday, the bench asked the poll body to clarify if the microcontroller is installed in the controlling unit or in the VVPAT; is the microcontroller one-time programmable; the number of available Symbol Loading Units; data period storage; and whether the Control Unit is only sealed or is the VVPAT is kept separately. After a poll body official responded to the court's queries, the bench said, \"We cannot control the elections, we cannot control the functioning of another constitutional authority.\" \"The ECI has cleared doubts. We cannot change your thought process. We cannot issue a mandamus on the basis of suspicion,\" it added. Presently, VVPAT verification is done only in five randomly selected EVMs in each Assembly segment of a parliamentary constituency. At all the EVM-VVPAT verification hearings, the ECI had maintained that the EVMs cannot be tampered with under any circumstances and that the complete counting of the VVPAT slips is not practically feasible. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court had issued a notice to the ECI on a petition seeking the counting of all VVPAT paper slips in elections, instead of verifying only the five randomly selected EVMs. The petition challenged the Election Commission's guidelines that mandate that VVPAT verification shall be done sequentially, that is one after the other, thereby causing undue delay. It contended that if simultaneous verification was done and an additional number of officers were deployed for counting in each Assembly constituency, then complete VVPAT verification could be done in just five to six hours."

Sources added that in the letter to the Ministry of External Affairs, Pakistan's Ministry of Water Resources said the decision to pause the agreement would create a crisis in the country. India has suspended the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty after Pakistan-backed terrorists attacked tourists in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam on April 22. Pak ministry writes to India, urges it to reconsider Indus treaty stance: Sources Indian tourists are boycotting Turkey and Azerbaijan due to their support for Pakistan. Tourism to Turkey is down 22%, while Azerbaijan has seen a 30% decrease in Indian visitors."

            "text": "India's latest aircraft carrier, INS Vikrant, played a significant role in Operation Sindoor. The warship moved from its Karwar base towards Pakistan, prowling near Karachi by May 9th. Equipped with BrahMos missiles and MiG-29K fighters, INS Vikrant's presence forced Pakistan to keep its aerial assets in a defensive mode. The Indian Navy maintains a credible capability to neutralise any aerial threats, effectively ensuring dominance in the maritime space. Pakistan's decision to rebuild the Lashkar-e-Taiba headquarters in Muridshah, Punjab province, following an Indian airstrike, has raised concerns. Prime Minister Modi stated that 'Operation Sindoor' is now India's 'new normal' in response to terror attacks. The reconstruction plan coincides with a recent $2 billion IMF bailout to Pakistan, prompting questions about the source of funds for rebuilding terror infrastructure."

He is the first Buddhist and only the second judge from the Scheduled Caste to ascend to the nation's highest judicial office. Justice Gavai will serve until 23rd November 2025. His elevation is seen as symbolic of the judiciary's commitment to inclusivity and constitutional morality. The new CJI has been part of several important benches, including one that condemned bulldozer actions. The Supreme Court has criticised Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah for his controversial remarks, calling them inappropriate and disparaging. The High Court had directed an immediate FIR against Shah under sections related to separatist activities and maintenance of harmony. The Supreme Court refused to pass a stay order on the FIR, with the Chief Justice emphasising the responsibility of those in constitutional positions. The Indo-UAE Conclave 2025 commenced with an inspiring inaugural address by Aroon Purie, Editor-in-Chief of the India Today Group. In his remarks, Purie praised the UAE\u2019s remarkable transformation, calling its progress nothing short of a miracle. He described the country as one of the most advanced and cosmopolitan regions in the world."

The jawan, who had inadvertently crossed over from Firozpur on April 23, was handed over at the Attari-Wagah border at 10:30 am.

Pak returns BSF jawan to India 20 days after he accidentally crossed border Sukhpreet Singh, a resident of Zirakpur\u2019s Aashiana Complex, was arrested on May 12, 2025, for stealing an Indian Air Force uniform and impersonating IAF personnel in public. In an exclusive interview with India Today, military historian and aviation analyst Tom Cooper hailed the Indian Air Force and said that India was a clear winner in the air battle against Pakistan. A day after reiterating that Op Sindoor is India's new normal, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said not a single Pakistani missile could breach India's air bases. In an exclusive interview with India Today, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor talked about the Pahalgam terror attack in J&K, Operation Sindoor and President Donald Trump's claim that the US brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan."

We\u2019ve cracked the code on daily engagement with personalised, compassionate coaching\u2014helping patients make meaningful, lasting improvements during and beyond treatment,\u201d Bajaj said. Bajaj had left the Byju\u2019s-owned company, a year after the online coding tutor was acquired in an all-cash deal worth $300 million in 2020, marking its entry into the computer code learning segment, with a focus on high school and college students. Mukker who was the head of customer experience and delivery had replaced Bajaj as the CEO of WhiteHat Jr. Commenting on the investment, Amit A Patel, managing director at Owl Ventures, said, \u201cWith rising cancer incidence rates, Complement 1 is creating a revolutionary new model to improve global cancer outcomes. We were impressed by the team\u2019s ability to combine high-tech personalisation and education with high-touch CoActive Coaching focused on physical activity, somatic and nutrition human guidance to solve a critical gap in oncology.\u201d"

People who use AI will replace people who don't use AI, just like people who used automation or computers probably replaced those who didn't, said Adobe Inc chairman and chief executive Shantanu Narayen adding that the speed and accessibility at which the technology shift is happening this time is making it seem more disruptive. The 62-year-old, who has been steering the $21.5 billion software giant for almost two decades, spoke with ET's Surabhi Agarwal and Annapurna Roy during a recent India visit and said that India is seeing dramatic growth with a significant shift in how people are consuming the technology and software. Edited excerpts There's a lot of uncertainty in the world. What is the impact you see from Adobe's point of view? Firstly, companies like Adobe, we have the wherewithal, the brand, the capability... So in economic downturns, stronger companies actually should get stronger. Second thing we say at Adobe is, we plan for the upside and we'll react to the downside. I would say because we've had this massively successful economic run, the sentiment is probably a little bit more negative, as a result of all these things. But you know, if you think about it as building a company for the long run, it's another blip on the way to long term growth. Do you think countries which are more open will be better in the long term compared to the American economy which has to now bear the burden of tariffs? I'm still a big believer in the Indian and the American economy. As long as the Indian economy and the American economy do well, it's good for both countries. The relentless move towards allowing for free trade, whatever that free may mean between countries, is the way it's going to go. It's true that Post-Covid, people have all said supply chains also need to be closer to home, maybe for security reasons for other reasons. But I like to focus on the things that I can control, which is building great software and serving customers. Where are you on the immigration debate that is happening right now in America? I always tell the story of my graduating class, 65 per cent went to the US. My brother, who's older than me, 90 per cent of his graduating class went to the US. And now I think the new generation, 5 per cent go to the US. This is phenomenal for India, because people are finding incredible ways to grow their career and contribute to India. A lot of this work can be done remotely. It's a sign of the changing times. And we're not one of those companies, unlike the systems integrators or outsourcers who have this big issue with visas or immigration. One of the fears is that AI is going to hit the creative industry. Where do you see this going? People who use AI will replace people who don't use AI, just like people who used automation or computers probably replaced those who didn't. So, that is my fundamental belief. People will be required to create different forms of skill to differentiate their craft. I think what's different this time is the speed at which it's happening and the accessibility at which it's happening. People are going to see this as more disruptive, but I think it's a job of companies like Adobe to view this as an opportunity and leverage it rather than fight it."

The company has been making efforts to reduce its total acquisition related debt of around $1.2 billion. Mumbai: India's biotech flagship Biocon's profitability is being pulled down by structured venture debt prompting it to look at a fundraise of \u20b94,500 crore to increase promoter stake in its subsidiary Biocon Biologics, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, chairperson, Biocon Group, told ET in an exclusive interaction. \"I have a very strong business, but my profitability is being dragged down because of the structured venture debt that I took. This structured venture debt leads to a lot of provisioning and that erodes or erases your profitability,\" said Shaw. \"My aim is to have a QIP and capital raise that can convert that structured venture debt into raised promoter equity. If I remove that, then my promoter equity of Biocon increases in Biologics.\" \"That will then create a very strong balance sheet, and it will also create a good profitability which is what this business can do,\" said Shaw. Biocon Biologics acquired Viatris's global biosimilars business in 2022 for $3.3 billion. The company has been making efforts to reduce its total acquisition related debt of around $1.2 billion. Biocon operates its biosimilars business through BBL. Biocon Biologics has received investment from several entities, including True North, Tata Capital Growth Fund, Goldman Sachs, and ADQ, a sovereign wealth fund from Abu Dhabi. \"I am not taking all of them back...some of them are straight equity which I will not touch but many of them are structured debt and that is what we are taking out,\" said Shaw, making clear her plan. She did not mention a specific timeline for the QIP but added that it will be \"as soon as possible.\" For the quarter ended March, Biocon's net profit surged 153 per cent to \u20b9344 crore, while consolidated total revenue was \u20b94,454 crore, up 2 per cent over last year. \"Today if I look at my business, I have 25 per cent Ebitda on a little over a billion dollars of sales right now...we have generated $260 million of Ebitda but then look at the profitability coming down due to all this provisioning...if I can remove all that it will throw up good cash and profits,\" she added. The company, which was earlier looking at listing its Biologics business, is now considering option to merge it with the parent company in view of the volatile market condition for an IPO. \"Initially, we were obviously focused on an IPO for Biologics. Now, with all these market uncertainties, it's not the right time for an IPO,\" said Shaw. \"So how soon will that window open? We don't know. In the interim, our board said also, look at a merger, because that could also unlock value with all the things that are going on. So, that's what we are also looking at, saying, what is a closer value unlocking opportunity, is it IPO? Or is it a merger? That's what we are looking at,\" she added. However, Shaw also said that ultimately the company may opt for an IPO, \"but we are still also looking at a merger, and we wanted to be transparent about.\" Shaw also said the company aiming to be the number 3 biosimilars company in the world in the next five years. Biocon's global biosimilar launch plans over the next 12 to 18 months include aflibercept, bevacizumab, aspart and denosumab. Presently, Biocon has a portfolio of 20 biosimilars, ten of which are approved, nine have been commercialised globally of which five were launched in the US. In Q4, Biologics delivered a 9 per cent year-on-year revenue increase driven by significant market share gains in the US and key tender wins in emerging markets. On a full-year basis, the company posted a 15 per cent growth in FY25. It is set for five new product launches in the next 12-18 months and expanding patient access. In FY25, biosimilars continued to build shares in global markets with four biosimilars recording sales of $200 million each."

            "text": "In an interview with Vinod Mahanta, Chesky also talks about doing business in a volatile geopolitical environment and how AI would impact hospitality sector. Airbnb is playing the long game in India, betting on a rapidly growing Gen Z and millennial population to turn one of its fastest-growing markets into one of its biggest. 'We are still in investment mode in India, and we will be investing very heavily in coming years,' says Brian Chesky, chief executive of the US-based vacation home rentals company, which projects global spending by Indian travellers to reach $29 billion by 2029. In an interview with Vinod Mahanta, Chesky also talks about doing business in a volatile geopolitical environment and how AI would impact hospitality sector. Edited excerpts: Where does India stand in terms of booking value? We have our first five core markets, and then eight expansion markets after that. Right now, unfortunately, India isn't in the top 10 by size, but it is one of the fastest-growing markets on Airbnb. And I really believe India is a long game. Over time, I think it will become one of the biggest markets for us. Just look at the demographics - India has a huge population of Gen Z and millennials, and this group disproportionately chooses Airbnb compared to older generations... We're going to be investing significantly in India in the coming years. Amid escalating geopolitical tensions and tariff disruption, have you observed significant shifts in global travel patterns or traveller sentiment? We've seen some changes, but no major shifts so far. When cross-border travel slows, domestic travel often picks up - and we have strong local markets that help balance things out. We saw this during the pandemic. Of course, travel is discretionary and exposed to macro shocks. But with new services we're becoming more diversified and less dependent on any one travel pattern. Is volatile geopolitics the new normal for global businesses? Volatile geopolitics may well be the new normal. However, we've built a business that goes far beyond what most hotels or OTAs (online travel aggregators) offer. While many of them remain heavily focused on the US or Europe, Airbnb is growing fastest in Latin America and Asia. We span budget to luxury, urban to rural, young to older travellers - and now with services and experiences, we're diversifying even further. People will start using Airbnb not just when they travel, but in their own cities. That makes us more resilient. And just like major tech platforms, we're expanding our aperture, not just vertically, but horizontally. This is no longer just about vacation rentals. It's the beginning of something bigger: a real-world platform that connects people, places, and services everywhere. You mentioned that 2025 marks the beginning of Airbnb's next chapter. What will be fundamentally different in this new phase? Let me start with what's not changing. If you want to book a home on Airbnb, you still can-same experience, same ease. What we stand for isn't changing either. We've always been about real travel and authentic connection. But now we're expanding. The biggest shift is Airbnb Services. We realised people value time and skills as much as space, so we're expanding beyond homes-bringing in chefs, trainers, stylists, and photographers, while completely rebuilding Airbnb Experiences, launching Originals, and redesigning the app to support it all. This is the biggest redesign we've ever done. You don't even need to be on a trip; this fits into daily life. And this is just the beginning. With Airbnb's latest expansion of services, do you feel the company is starting to resemble the very hotel industry it once set out to disrupt? The goal isn't to become like hotels; it's to take what people already love about Airbnb and add what they love about hotels. At the heart of it all are real people. Hotels are about standardisation; Airbnb is about connection. We're not just building a product. We're building a community. And that's always been the point. How do you see AI reshaping the future of hospitality? I think AI will absolutely change hospitality, but probably more slowly than in other industries. Hospitality is not entirely digital or easily repeatable. It is built around people and around service with heart. So, while AI will transform how we discover and plan travel, how we communicate, and how we get support, the actual experience of travel - meeting people, staying in homes, having real world moments - that part is going to remain deeply human, at least for a while. Robots might lift boxes in warehouses before they are welcoming you to a cabin. Do you see AI becoming foundational to Airbnb's moat? I can't imagine a tech company in the next decade that doesn't have AI at the core of everything it does. It's like imagining a software company in the 2010s with no connection to the internet. For us, AI won't just be a feature - it'll be foundational. We've got incredible design and product teams, and we've always been a human-centred tech company. What sets us apart is our data - not just online behaviour, but how people move through the real world. That's where applied AI comes in. We're imagining Airbnb as a truly personal concierge - something that understands you and helps you move through the world with ease and meaning. And we're already moving fast. The customer service agent is just the beginning. You'll see major AI-driven changes on Airbnb over the next two years. Could we see Airbnb become a super-app for travel-accommodations, experiences, payments, insurance and an AI-driven concierge all in one? There really aren't super apps in the US, the way there are in places like China. I'm not sure we've earned the title 'super app' yet - that's a big one - but we're definitely becoming something bigger. You can now book homes, services, and experiences, all in one place."

Mumbai-based gaming company Dream Sports has invested $50 million (around \u20b9427 crore) in cricket media platform Cricbuzz and North American cricket broadcaster Willow TV, both owned by Times Internet, the companies said on Tuesday. With this investment, Dream Sports will get a strategic minority interest in Cricbuzz and Willow TV, which collectively have 185 million monthly users across more than 150 countries. 'Cricbuzz and Willow sit at the heart of how hundreds of millions of fans follow cricket everyday,' Times Internet vice chairman Satyan Gajwani said. 'We're excited to work with Dream Sports to reimagine and develop new ways to collaboratively create new experiences for cricket fans across the planet.' In March 2023, Willow TV secured rights to broadcast International Cricket Council events in the US and Canada until the end of 2027, extending a partnership that began in 2016. Willow TV, the largest cricket broadcaster in North America, streams more than 1,500 live matches each year to users in the US and Canada, and has also expanded its broadcast footprint into a leading cricket broadcast platform for the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Dream Sports' investment in Cricbuzz and Willow TV will create new opportunities for fan experiences, the statement said, adding that the companies intend to collaborate to provide more real-time analysis and statistics, engagement and commerce integrations, and AI-driven predictions to Cricbuzz's audience. Times Internet is the digital arm of The Times of India Group, which publishes The Economic Times. Dream Sports cofounder and CEO Harsh Jain said: 'Dream Sports' mission is to 'make sports better' for Indian sports fans. Cricbuzz and Dream11 have worked together for over a decade, and with this investment, all cricket fans can expect much more fan engagement, interactive streams, and integrated commerce experiences that will bring them closer to the action and to each other.' Avendus Capital acted as the exclusive financial advisor to the transaction. With 200 million users, Dream Sports, which operates the fantasy platform Dream11, has been expanding its presence beyond India. Earlier this month, it joined the ownership group of English football club Salford City FC, becoming part of a consortium led by footballing icons David Beckham and Gary Neville, alongside business leaders Declan Kelly and Lord Mervyn Davies. The company also runs sports content and commerce platform FanCode and experiential sports travel platform DreamSetGo."

            "text": "Flipkart is limiting the expansion plans of its quick commerce unit, Flipkart Minutes, as it looks to add new dark stores only in the top six to eight cities. Walmart-owned ecommerce giant Flipkart is limiting the expansion of its quick commerce unit, Flipkart Minutes, to the top six to eight cities to rein in costs, according to people familiar with the matter. Flipkart Minutes, which competes with Eternal-owned Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, Zepto, BigBasket\u2019s BB Now and Amazon Now, is currently present in 14 cities and runs a network of more than 300 so-called dark stores, or mini warehouses. The intent is to scale this up to around 500-550 by October. Flipkart group chief executive Kalyan Krishnamurthy had said in April that Minutes would have 800 stores by this year-end. \u201cMore than 90 per cent of the quick commerce volumes are generated from the top eight cities and a bulk of this comes from Delhi-NCR, Mumbai and Bengaluru where Flipkart is going deeper with Minutes,\u201d one of the people said. With this shift, Flipkart joins its Bengaluru-based rival Swiggy in taking a relatively cautious approach to expansion from hereon, notwithstanding Eternal\u2019s plans to aggressively chase market share even at the cost of short-term profitability. \u201c...(Flipkart) plans to expand to 500-550 dark stores before its annual \u2018big billion days\u2019 sale. However, it is also under pressure to halve its ongoing cash burn of around $40 million (\u20b9340-350 crore) a month over the next few quarters in a bid to launch its IPO,\u201d analysts at brokerage firm HSBC Securities wrote in a May 12 research note. Flipkart did not respond to queries sent by ET. Last month, Flipkart\u2019s board cleared the company\u2019s proposal to shift its domicile from Singapore to India, ahead of a planned IPO in 2026. The process, which is underway now, was initiated almost a year after Flipkart raised $350 million from Google as part of a $1 billion funding round led by Walmart. Flipkart\u2019s tempered quick commerce push comes amid the rapid growth witnessed by the sector over the last one year \u2014 particularly when the broader ecommerce segment with a long-tail of categories has seen sluggishness. A March 2025 joint report by Bain & Company and Flipkart pointed out that India\u2019s e-tail gross merchandise value (GMV) growth slowed down to 10-12 per cent in 2024 from over 20 per cent in the previous years on account of macroeconomic consumption stress. In the same period, quarterly gross order value (GOV) for quick commerce players more than doubled, albeit on a smaller base. Even as Flipkart works to shorten delivery timelines across its broader ecommerce network, a wider expansion of Minutes could result in increased losses \u2014 as visible with Blinkit and Instamart, which together added more than 600 dark stores in the January-March quarter. Both Blinkit and Instamart, whose parents are listed, have a presence in close to 100 cities. They have significantly increased cash burn to undertake this expansion. While Blinkit, which added 294 dark stores, incurred a capital expenditure of \u20b9317 crore during the three-month period ended March 2025, Instamart spent \u20b9425 crore in capex to add 316 such micro-warehouses to its network. Blinkit\u2019s operating losses for the quarter came in at \u20b9178 crore, while for Instamart it was Rs 840 crore. ET reported on February 15 that the top three quick commerce players \u2013 Blinkit, Instamart and Zepto \u2013 were collectively burning around \u20b91,300-1,500 crore per month with Zepto accounting for the largest share. Burn rate measures how quickly a company spends its reserves before generating positive cash flow. The funds are typically used for user acquisition and maintaining growth through marketing, discounting and in this case opening new warehouses. Industry analysts noted that while promoting quick commerce in urban centres requires considerable marketing investments, it is the rapid physical expansion of opening dark stores that strains finances. \u201cFor new players, it\u2019s logical to build a sustainable model before expanding to smaller towns. In quick commerce, unless a dark store achieves around 1,000 orders per day \u2014 which typically happens in densely populated areas with high-rise buildings \u2014 it\u2019s hard to break even,\u201d said Abhishek Pathak, internet sector analyst at brokerage firm Motilal Oswal. \u201cThey (Flipkart Minutes) might be focusing on profitable growth, likely in preparation for the IPO. However, capturing market dominance in cities like Mumbai or Delhi is challenging, given the entrenched presence of Zepto, Blinkit and Swiggy,\u201d Pathak added. To be sure, Flipkart Minutes\u2019 plan to scale up to 800 dark stores will be the fastest ever in the quick commerce segment. The company had launched quick commerce operations in August 2024 in Bengaluru in a few pockets. Instamart took over two years to hit 700 dark stores that it achieved in December 2024. Zepto and Instamart topped the 1,000 dark-store-mark in the January-March quarter, whereas Blinkit had over 1,300 dark stores on its network as of March 31. The Gurgaon-based company plans to have 2,000 such warehouses by December 2025. Amazon Now is also expanding its network to 300 dark stores in Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru and Mumbai by end-2025, ET had reported in March."

The Indian healthcare AI market is on a rapid ascent\u2014projected to hit $1.6 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 40.5 per cent. Amid this digital revolution, Shikha Saxena, President of HCL Healthcare, is steering a bold transformation\u2014blending data, empathy, and innovation to redefine how India Inc. thinks about wellness. In an exclusive interview with ET Entrepreneur, Saxena shares how her team is building scalable, AI-powered, phygital ecosystems that go beyond basic health checks to deliver measurable, preventive care outcomes\u2014for both boardroom leaders and underserved populations. From smart health reports and predictive analytics to a culture of clinical accountability, her vision puts people at the heart of technology, ensuring wellness is not just accessible\u2014but deeply impactful. Edited excerpts: You\u2019ve built scalable, tech-enabled healthcare ecosystems across corporates and startups. What key principles guide you when architecting solutions that must serve both enterprise clients and underserved populations? When you are designing healthcare solutions in a country as complex as India, it is imperative that the approach must be tailored to meet the needs of the vast and diverse populace. However, few core principles anchor our work. First, we focus sharply on defining the specific problem we aim to solve. For corporate HR leaders, it\u2019s often about reducing illness-related absenteeism and building a healthier, more engaged workforce. For families in low-access or underserved areas, it\u2019s about ensuring the system surfaces early health risk signals to enable timely interventions. The reality is that the majority in our country do not visit doctors for regular checkups. We believe that precise problem definition leads to precise solutions \u2014 and our phygital care model is deliberately designed to flex and adapt across diverse populations, needs, and contexts. Second, we keep our partner ecosystem central to everything we do. We deliberately avoid building in isolation. Instead, we bring together corporations, diagnostic partners, healthcare professionals, insurers, and others \u2014 because we understand that no single player can solve India\u2019s healthcare challenges alone. Our Medical Excellence teams continuously audit and refine partner services to ensure standardization and quality benchmarks are met across every touchpoint. Finally, we prioritize actionable data \u2014 not just amassing information but using it meaningfully. Across the industry, many sit on vast stores of health data yet struggle to translate it into targeted, impactful interventions, especially for non-communicable diseases like cholesterol, obesity, and diabetes. That\u2019s why we built our Condition Management team: to close the loop between preventive health screenings and sustained lifestyle change. Over the last decade, we\u2019ve improved outcomes for over 100,000 individuals \u2014 transforming data into measurable, real-world impact. At HCL Healthcare, you emphasize data-driven, human-centric care. How do you balance advanced analytics with the emotional and experiential aspects of patient and employee wellbeing? With the rise of AI and advanced analytics, the role of data in healthcare has become indispensable. As the saying goes, AI will never replace the human touch in medicine, and I believe in the same philosophy. At HCL Healthcare, on average, a patient conversation at HCL Healthcare lasts 12\u201315 minutes, nearly 2-3x longer than the industry norm, ensuring patients feel heard, understood, and supported. When annual health checks or screenings surface potential risks, we don\u2019t stop at automated alerts. We proactively engage care coordinators to guide individuals through next steps, offering tailored care plans when desired. Our approach integrates analytics and empathy, ensuring that interventions are not just reactive but meaningful. Importantly, we treat emotional and experiential wellbeing as tangible, trackable outcomes. Through our corporate health programs, we continuously gather feedback from employees and corporate partners alike, using those insights to refine and elevate our services. Our AI-enabled corporate dashboards provide HR leaders with actionable population health insights and the dashboards we provide to individuals benchmark their health data against similar cohorts and empower them with tailored action plans. Reflecting on your journey through health-tech and Insurtech, which emerging technology or digital model do you believe will most profoundly reshape corporate wellness in the 3-5 years? Looking ahead, I believe the next wave of transformation in healthcare, particularly corporate wellness, will come from AI drive, hyper personalised ecosystems where insights and behavioural science intersect to deliver tangible outcomes. One exciting frontier is AI-assisted clinician support: imagine a doctor\u2019s assistant that can instantly summarize a patient\u2019s entire medical journey\u2014past diagnoses, medications, diagnostic tests, lifestyle factors\u2014all neatly integrated into the EMR. This not only sharpens clinical decisions but reduces errors and improves patient outcomes dramatically. This helps bring chronic disease management, emergency room visits, insurance claims and even absenteeism under control. By applying advanced statistical models that learn from population health trends and demographic profiles, we can map individual users to high-risk cohorts and proactively design interventions. It\u2019s not just about treating illness\u2014it\u2019s about anticipating it and shifting the trajectory before the condition escalates. And then, there\u2019s AI co-pilots that can give a hot body outcome\u2014that is, systems which give similar experience as humans using technology are gaining traction. These systems that adapt to the user habits and provide a hyper personalized experience such as LLM Co-Pilots mimic the best of human interaction but are available 24/7. These adaptive platforms nudge users toward healthier behaviours in a way that\u2019s natural and sticky. In essence, I see the next era of corporate wellness as a fusion of cutting-edge AI and compassionate care, where technology doesn\u2019t replace the human touch but augments it powerfully. Leading one of India\u2019s largest corporate health programmes requires aligning diverse stakeholders\u2014from C-suite sponsors to on-ground wellness teams. How do you cultivate a culture of innovation and accountability at scale? In healthcare, innovation isn\u2019t optional\u2014it\u2019s essential for relevance and impact. At HCL Healthcare, where we operate at the intersection of clinical excellence, advanced technology, and corporate wellness, innovation is embedded in everything we do. From enhancing AI-driven health insights to redesigning disease identification pathways and elevating user experiences, innovation drives both our scale and quality. However, innovation without accountability is meaningless. We cultivate both by fostering a culture of trust and empowerment\u2014encouraging clinicians and product teams to reimagine care delivery and build next-gen platforms. Cross-functional collaboration is key, as our work spans clinical teams, diagnostics, IT, HR, and corporate clients, all connected through feedback loops and transparent communication. Learning is institutionalized, with every employee dedicating a portion of their work hours to upskilling via platforms like Percipio. Additionally, we have recognition frameworks that reward ideas translated into measurable outcomes\u2014whether it\u2019s a new digital health initiative or improved engagement in wellness programs. Ultimately, innovation for us means making a tangible difference in the health and wellbeing of India\u2019s workforce and honoring the trust our clients place in us every day. You\u2019ve been recognized globally for driving accessible and affordable care. What bold, strategic initiative or partnership are you most excited about that could accelerate your vision for truly universal corporate healthcare? We are currently operating and driving at HCL Healthcare what we call the Integrated Phygital (physical-digital) Corporate Health model. This is designed with the intent to enhance access and continuity of care for our customers. As part of this effort, we have onboarded and are rapidly integrating with the partner ecosystem to create a seamless journey spanning from preventive care to primary, secondary and other wellness initiatives. With this model, unlike other players in the market, we don\u2019t stop at health checks but rather we see it as the start of the care journey for our patients. We have built a closed loop ecosystem where every touchpoint from risk identification to condition management is covered. We believe in measurable outcomes and our intent is to provide actionable insights to our stakeholders be it, disease trajectory for individuals or enhancing productivity metrics such as Absenteeism, reduction in hospital admissions etc amongst the employees of our corporate clients. One initiative I am particularly energized about is our AI driven smart Health Reports. These reports are designed to give not only retrospective data but also predictive insights enabling them to curate an action plan for a healthier workforce. For instance, once we identify a high risk population cluster, we can recommend targeted interventions such as secondary care, condition management, awareness sessions etc to help turn this around. I am confident that there is no other player offering such comprehensive health analytics in the market. I believe that by fusing technology and enhancing strategic partnerships, we are creating a truly agile organization that is poised to disrupt the current health tech industry."

            "title": "How Singhi Advisors built a reputation as India's go-to M&amp;A specialist",
            "text": "In an M&A landscape dominated by volume metrics and market noise, Singhi Advisors has quietly built a powerhouse brand grounded in trust, precision, and insight. In a world where financial advisory firms often market scale over substance, Singhi Advisors stands as a refreshing outlier\u2014a brand that has quietly but confidently shaped the Indian M&A landscape with insight, integrity, and impact. It all started in 1989, when Singhi Associates entered India's rapidly transforming business environment. With a clear vision but little fanfare, the firm began offering advisory solutions that prioritized depth over dazzle. Rather than rely on high-gloss pitches, Singhi focused on something marketers can relate to: customer intimacy and insight-led problem-solving. Their approach? Embedded advisory. Long before 'consultative selling' became a buzzword, Singhi was already inside boardrooms and across factory floors\u2014deeply integrating with client operations to co-create business solutions. That unique positioning soon became their brand's foundation. By 2005, as India's liberalized economy opened the floodgates of cross-border opportunity, Singhi pivoted. The firm rebranded as Singhi Advisors and doubled down on M&A\u2014a bold move that transformed it from a generalist player to a niche powerhouse. For marketers, this is a masterclass in brand focus. While others diversified, Singhi specialized. They aligned their messaging, capabilities, and culture around one promise: 'Where Deals Get Done'. What started as a tagline evolved into a brand truth\u2014reinforced by over 1,000 strategic transactions. Singhi didn't rely on traditional marketing to build its name. No splashy campaigns. No heavy ad spends. Instead, the firm grew through reputation marketing\u2014referrals, repeat business, and relationships. Over time, its name became synonymous with precision execution in mid-market M&A, especially in complex, cross-border deals. Still, the brand wasn't static. It adapted. As storytelling became central to B2B engagement, Singhi began embracing digital platforms to showcase thought leadership\u2014crafting content that not only informs but resonates with the C-suite. What truly sets Singhi Advisors apart is its evolved brand identity. The firm is now positioning itself as more than a dealmaker\u2014it's becoming 'The Deal Factory'. Think of it as a B2B brand ecosystem: a place where insight meets execution, where process, expertise, and trust converge to create repeatable value for clients. From project advisory ('From Concept to Commissioning') to strategic turnaround initiatives ('Revitalizing Business Potential') and global dealmaking ('Connecting Businesses Beyond Borders'), the firm has built sub-brands that reinforce its credibility and differentiate its capabilities. Singhi\u2019s recent expansion into Pune and Ahmedabad, with Hyderabad on the horizon, reflects more than operational scale\u2014it signals strategic intent. Even more telling is the firm\u2019s exploration of launching a global buyout fund\u2014a move that shifts its brand from pure advisor to potential capital partner. For marketers, it's a shift from service provider to strategic enabler. Three brand pillars anchor Singhi's identity: knowledge, trust, and conviction. These values don't just decorate the website\u2014they guide how the firm shows up in every pitch, deal, and client relationship. That's brand authenticity in action. And while many firms measure success in numbers, Singhi takes a more strategic view: long-term value creation. Every deal isn't just a close\u2014it's a chapter in a client's growth story. That's how Singhi Advisors has managed to stay relevant, trusted, and respected in an increasingly transactional space.

            "text": "Amazon and Samara Capital-backed More Retail plans a \u20b92,000 crore IPO within 18 months, primarily via fresh equity. The supermarket chain will use proceeds to expand its store network and halve its \u20b9500 crore debt. Amazon and Samara Capital-owned food and grocery supermarket chain More Retail is planning a \u20b92,000 crore initial public offering (IPO) in the next 12-18 months, said managing director Vinod Nambiar. The proposed IPO will be mostly through fresh capital raising, with no significant offer-for-sale component, as the promoters, Samara Capital, and Amazon's investment entity in Singapore-with 51 per cent and 48 per cent stakes respectively-are unlikely to offload their holdings, Nambiar told reporters on Monday. The balance 1 per cent is held by high net worth individuals and family offices through holding company More Consumer Brands. 'Both Samara and Amazon believe in the asset, and they want to build the business long term,' said Nambiar. He said proceeds from the public issue will be used to fund network expansion and to retire a large part of debt. 'More Retail has plans to expand its 775 store network to 3,000 stores by 2030 and halve its debt from Rs 500 crore as of today by the time it will go public,' he said. More Retail's current debt is a mix of term loans and non-commercial borrowings. Nambiar said the business is not capital intensive as it takes about \u20b930 lakh for setting up a supermarket since the real estate is taken on lease. Nambiar said Amazon and Samara have together infused \u20b9900 crore in the company in the last five years, which was used mostly to trim losses. The company recently raised another \u20b9150 crore by selling 1 per cent stake to family offices in the last two months. More Retail recorded sales of \u20b94,985 crore in 2024-25, growing 14 per cent from the year before. About a quarter of sales came from online since the company is the preferred seller for Amazon's grocery retail venture in India, Amazon Fresh. The company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (Ebitda) loss narrowed sharply to \u20b965 crore last fiscal from \u20b9260 crore in FY23. This fiscal, it expects to post an Ebitda profit of \u20b960 crore, Nambiar said. 'In about two years, we expect to be net profit positive. We should not lose cash from the operations. This fiscal, we are also targeting \u20b96,000 crore revenue,' he said. More Retail has rationalised its store network by shutting unprofitable stores and exiting markets like Maharashtra including Mumbai, New Delhi and Indore. It also exited from lifestyle categories to focus only on food and grocery. The company has a presence in South India, Punjab, Haryana, Gurugram and Noida, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh. It plans to enter Jharkhand and Odisha this year."

            "text": "Despite recent price increases to combat inflation, the company hopes for healthy growth in both volume and revenue. Britannia managing director and vice chairman Varun Berry on Monday said demand recovery is unlikely to follow a sharp 'hockey stick' trend but improve gradually and continue till next year. He said the revival process has begun already. Speaking at an analysts' call to discuss quarterly earnings, Berry noted that this fiscal year should be a 'test' of both revenue and volume growth for the biscuit and dairy product maker. 'So, we are hoping that we will be able to grow revenue and volumes,' he said. 'Obviously, there will be a delta because we have taken a pretty high price increase in the last quarter, and we will be necessitated to take slightly more price increases to make sure that we deal with the inflation which comes in. But having said that, we are hoping to see healthy growth, both volume as well as revenue.' For about two fiscals, large FMCG companies have been reporting price hike-led revenue growth in an inflationary environment while volume or unit sales remained under stress as consumers either cut back on spending or purchased cheaper smaller brands. Senior executives at Hindustan Unilever, Tata Consumer Products, and Marico mentioned in recent earnings calls that demand recovery will take some time due to persistent inflation but is definitely expected. For Britannia, volume growth has been reasonably good compared to revenue, even in the last two years, Berry said. He, however, added the company may not need further price hikes with some remnants of the last price increase having already passed on to the first two months of this quarter. 'But that will all depend on how the trends (commodity price) move through the quarter and we will have to take a call based on those trends,' he said. Berry was appointed as the interim CEO, effective May 8, following the exit of erstwhile CEO Rajneet Kohli. He said a succession plan is being worked out. 'The succession planning is in play, and it will definitely be clear to you in the next 3-4 months...,' he said, without elaborating."

            "text": "With one of the youngest entrepreneur bases in Asia-Pacific, India\u2019s SME sector is well-positioned to drive sustained growth and innovation, says the 2025 edition of the Asia-Pacific Small Business Survey. Rising costs continue to be a challenge for many small businesses, with 40% of MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises) respondents citing increasing expenses as their biggest concern, according to a survey by the professional accounting body CPA Australia. The survey, which collected responses from 4,236 small businesses across 11 Asia-Pacific markets in November and December 2024, including 507 from India, found that 72% of Indian small businesses sought external funds last year; 34% cited rising costs as the primary reason for needing finance, while 32% attributed it to reasons relating to business survival. Founded in 1886, CPA Australia represents more than 175,000 members working in over 100 countries around the world. Each year, the organisation conducts research on the key trends shaping small businesses in the Asia-Pacific region. The 2025 edition of the Asia-Pacific Small Business Survey provides data to assist small business owners, advisers and policymakers in their decision-making processes. Commenting on the survey results, Prafulla Chhajed, a certified practicing accountant with CPA Australia, says that access to finance remains a critical need for small businesses in India. \u201cIn 2024, over 71% of Indian SMEs sought external funding, well above the survey average, primarily to drive business growth. While traditional banks remain the main source for 38% of respondents, there is increasing demand for faster, more flexible credit options. Encouragingly, new solutions are emerging.\u201d Chhajed adds that tailored financial products like SME-specific credit cards and government-backed initiatives, such as collateral-free loans of up to Rs 100 crore for MSMEs under the Union Budget 2024-25, are improving access to capital. Financial literacy, he says, remains an essential component. \u201cFinancial inclusion now is no longer just about access to capital; it is also about ensuring small businesses have the knowledge, tools, and support to grow confidently and sustainably,\u201d he states. Among the small businesses that sought external funding last year, 43% indicated that obtaining financing was easy or very easy. This trend is expected to continue this year, with 39% expecting smooth access to finance. Among other highlights, the survey showed that India\u2019s small businesses continue to be among the most focused on innovation. Chhajed states that nearly 80% of businesses are planning to launch new products, services, or processes in 2025, and a sharp increase is being seen in investment in technologies like AI. \u201cWith one of the youngest entrepreneur bases in the region, India\u2019s SME sector is well-positioned to drive sustained growth and innovation. Overall, these trends highlight a forward-thinking, growth-oriented sector that is not only embracing new technologies but also focusing on scalability, job creation and global expansion,\u201d he highlights. Another notable finding is the strong hiring trend. In 2024, 46% of Indian small businesses reported increasing the size of their workforce, making them the leading job creators among the surveyed Asia-Pacific markets. An even better result is expected this year, with 64% planning to hire more employees, well above the survey average of 45%. People remain a key asset for India\u2019s small businesses, with good staff emerging as their most influential positive factor in 2024. India also has a high proportion of small business owners or leaders under 40, and younger entrepreneurs are more likely to be running businesses that are growing and creating new jobs, it stated. The survey also reflected how the technology uptake by Indian small businesses is consistent with the Asia-Pacific average. According to the survey, 26% of such businesses heavily invested in AI in the past year. This shift is enabling them to optimise operations, enhance customer experiences, and streamline processes. Additionally, over 83% of these businesses now generate more than 10% of their revenue through digital, online, or mobile payments, and more than 86% are using social media for business purposes. \u201cAdopting AI is critical for SMEs to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving market. It helps businesses automate tasks, make data-driven decisions, and create more personalised customer interactions\u2014key advantages in today\u2019s fast-paced, tech-driven economy. However, with greater digital integration comes increased exposure to cybersecurity risks. The survey revealed that 43% of SMEs still reported financial or time losses due to cyber incidents. This highlights the need for businesses to strengthen their cybersecurity measures,\u201d Chhajed cautions. On the bright side, the survey stated that India\u2019s small business sector is one of the most dynamic and optimistic in the Asia-Pacific. Survey findings revealed that 78% of Indian small businesses grew last year, reflecting the country\u2019s strong post-pandemic recovery. \u201cThis momentum has been driven by a vibrant business environment and a strong emphasis on innovation and rapid digital transformation,\u201d Chhajed emphasises."

Integrating AI, data analytics, and digital solutions can expand access to education, boost workforce upskilling, advance healthcare, and accelerate climate action\u2014setting new benchmarks for tech-driven social good. Nasscom Foundation, along with Nasscom and BOD Consulting, released a CSR report titled \u201cTech Industry and CSR: Insights and Impactful Stories,\u201d highlighting the sector\u2019s evolving role in impactful CSR. The report states that India\u2019s tech industry contributed Rs 5,443 crore in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) spending in FY23, with companies going beyond the 2% mandate by leveraging technological expertise, scalability, and structured CSR strategies to drive long-term impact. On the sidelines of the launch, Jyoti Sharma, CEO, Nasscom Foundation, and Achyuta Ghosh, Senior Director and Head of Nasscom Insights, discussed with ET Online how technology is reshaping CSR, emerging trends, challenges, policy implications, and the growing focus on AI, digital skilling, and sustainability. Edited excerpts: Economic Times (ET): How are tech companies redefining CSR with AI, digital skilling, and sustainability initiatives? Jyoti Sharma (JS): I believe that technology is one of the most powerful enablers of inclusive growth. We see it not just as a tool but as a vital ally in addressing socio-economic challenges faced by marginalized communities. The pandemic accelerated digital transformation, expanding the scope of CSR and opening new avenues for tech-driven social impact. Today, tech companies are embedding AI, digital skilling, and sustainability into their CSR strategies. Initiatives include setting up digital infrastructures, integrating AI tools for real-time monitoring, skill-based volunteering and employing AI-based skill assessments. These efforts aim to build smart, scalable systems that support skill development, entrepreneurship, and employability, particularly among rural youth and women. By prioritizing access to technology and innovation, tech companies are bridging gaps in aspirational districts, improving access to essential services like healthcare, education, and agriculture. Failing to leverage technology effectively could hinder scalability and systemic change, as it has become an indispensable catalyst for sustainable, inclusive progress and a cornerstone of India's digital future. ET: CSR impact is often amplified through collaboration. How are you working with tech companies, government bodies, and local NGOs to drive holistic development? JS: I believe that effective CSR hinges on collaboration among tech companies, government bodies, and local NGOs. At Nasscom Foundation, our core philosophy of TechForGood drives us to harness technology for inclusive growth and sustainable development. This shift from isolated efforts to co-created, scalable models enhances outcomes and aligns with goals of inclusive growth and digital empowerment. In FY23, 75 leading tech companies spearheaded over 2,610 CSR projects, investing Rs 5,443 crore\u2014surpassing the mandated 2% of profits. These initiatives focused on education, climate action, and digital skilling, leveraging AI and digital platforms to reach millions and create sustainable pathways. Collaboration with the government aligns CSR with national objectives like digital inclusion and skilling, helping bridge regional disparities. Government-backed platforms like the Aspirational Districts Programme have seen a fivefold increase in CSR investment between FY19 and FY23. However, these districts, housing over 15% of India's population, still receive only about 2.15% of total CSR funds. Local NGOs contribute essential community insights and last-mile connectivity, enhanced by capacity-building initiatives and skill-based volunteering from the tech sector. Such multi-stakeholder collaboration amplifies the impact. Strengthening public-private partnerships, fostering regional collaborations, and creating platforms for knowledge sharing can further align CSR efforts with national development goals. Promoting technology-driven collaboration and structured engagement among companies, NGOs, and government bodies will help scale impact, address region-specific challenges, and ensure efficient, inclusive use of CSR resources. ET: How have you seen the CSR ecosystem evolve over the past decade, especially from a tech industry lens? Achyuta Ghosh (AG): While India\u2019s CSR landscape has evolved, key challenges persist\u2014particularly in equitable geographic distribution, prioritising aspirational districts, and fostering stronger NGO partnerships. Our 2024 CSR survey revealed that 21% of companies struggle with limited collaboration, 20% face hurdles in expanding into new sectors, and 15% find it difficult to identify suitable implementation partners. Addressing these gaps is essential to unlocking CSR\u2019s full potential and aligning it more closely with national development goals. CSR in India has transformed over the past decade, empowering millions, with the tech industry leading the way. The number of participating companies increased by 22% from 19,888 in FY22 to 24,392 in FY23, while total CSR expenditure grew by 12.6% from Rs 26,400 crores to Rs 29,700 crores. This growth, fueled by stronger policies, reflects a deeper commitment to nation-building and the SDGs. Key trends include education, skill development, livelihoods, and climate change as top focus areas, impacting over 6.5 crore lives in FY23. Notably, CSR spending in aspirational districts has increased fivefold since FY19, though it still accounts for only 4.5% of total CSR expenditure. Encouragingly, 41% of organizations now prioritize alignment with national priorities and the SDGs. Looking ahead, social innovation is projected to increase from 6% to 8% focus in the next 3\u20135 years. ET: What do you see as the emerging priorities for the future of CSR in India, and what gaps need to be addressed to make CSR efforts more impactful and inclusive? JS: I find it encouraging that CSR investments are becoming more strategic and aligned with national and global development goals. Still, organizations must better assess community needs and identify high-impact areas. In the coming years, skill development and livelihood generation are expected to surpass education as CSR priorities. Tech companies are entering areas like disaster response and WASH, while non-tech firms focus more on climate action. Social innovation is gaining ground, with focus expected to grow from 6% to 8%. Despite progress, companies face barriers in collaboration, sector expansion, and finding the right partners. On-the-ground challenges like tech resistance, fragmented gender efforts, and caste-based discrimination persist. A long-term, partnership-driven, tech-enabled approach is essential for deeper, inclusive impact. ET: Based on the report, what recommendations would you give to CSR leaders? AG: The report outlines key recommendations for CSR leaders aiming to replicate successful initiatives. It emphasizes establishing clear key performance indicators (KPIs) and leveraging AI tools for real-time monitoring to enable timely course corrections. Developing adaptive learning solutions tailored to diverse demographics, incorporating gamification and practical simulations, is highlighted to sustain engagement. Collaborating with academic and industry stakeholders to create impactful training programs ensures certifications align with industry standards, attracting participation. Partnering with local NGOs addresses regional talent issues effectively. Providing regional language content and mobile or offline learning resources bridges accessibility gaps. Combining technical and soft skills training, and utilizing case studies, offers clear career pathways for learners. Engaging with local organizations fosters effective outreach, builds trust, and allows for the customization of program goals to address community-specific challenges. Involving local outreach workers and leaders in a community-driven model ensures sustained behavioral change and program adoption. Partnering with organizations that possess local expertise helps bridge gaps in reach, logistics, and program execution. ET: How has the rise of professionalized CSR teams and strategic alignment within the tech industry contributed to more efficient, impactful initiatives\u2014particularly in areas like tech-led skilling and sustainable rural development? JS: I have observed a significant shift in how we approach social responsibility. CSR is no longer a peripheral activity; it is now a strategic imperative that aligns closely with our business objectives and national development goals. This evolution has enabled us to leverage our technological expertise to address pressing social and environmental challenges effectively. According to the Nasscom and Nasscom Foundation Annual CSR Survey 2024, 90% of tech-integrated projects reported increased impact, scalability, and efficiency. Furthermore, 41% of organizations are now prioritizing CSR goals that align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, reflecting our collective commitment to global societal advancement. It's clear that by embedding technology into our CSR strategies, we are not only driving meaningful change, but also setting a precedent for sustainable and inclusive growth."

The deal, which still needs Congressional sign-off, came as Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Turkey to attend a meeting of NATO foreign ministers on Thursday. Rubio is expected to travel on to Istanbul the following day for potential talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials about a ceasefire. Turkey has requested 53 advanced medium-range air-to-air missiles at an estimated cost of $225 million and 60 Block II missiles at $79.1 million, the Defence Security Cooperation Agency said. The RTX Corporation will be the principal contractor for the sales. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been looking for a tentative meeting with US President Donald Trump to reset strained relations stemming from Ankara\u2019s purchase of a Russian missile-defence system and Washington\u2019s support for a Syrian Kurdish militia that Turkey views as a threat to the country, among other disputes. Turkey and the US have been holding talks over the integration of the US-backed Kurdish forces, who have links to a separatist Turkish group, the PKK, into a new Syrian army. Earlier this week, the PKK announced it would lay down its arms to end a 40-year war for autonomy against Turkey, a historic step that could strengthen Ankara\u2019s aspirations to become a regional powerhouse.Turkey and the US have been holding talks over the integration of the US-backed Kurdish forces, who have links to a separatist Turkish group, the PKK, into a new Syrian army. Earlier this week, the PKK announced it would lay down its arms to end a 40-year war for autonomy against Turkey, a historic step that could strengthen Ankara\u2019s aspirations to become a regional powerhouse. Read More: Kurdish Separatist Group PKK Ends 40-Year War Against Turkey The US and Turkey have the two largest armies in NATO, giving them good reason to maintain their seven-decade alliance. As the Pentagon plans to consolidate operations in Syria and draw down troops to less than 1,000, Ankara is offering several thousand Turkish soldiers already stationed across the border to help stabilise its war-ravaged neighbour. At the same time, Turkey is prepared to assist in monitoring a potential ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine across the Black Sea, in line with the US goal of stabilising the region. Turkey has repeatedly expressed its intention to add F-35 warplanes to its planned arms purchases, although this will require the US to lift a ban on Ankara from buying the fifth-generation fighter imposed following its acquisition of the Russian S-400 missile-defence system. Turkey\u2019s purchase of the Russian S-400s resulted in a deadlock with Washington, prompting the latter to impose sanctions known as CAATSA that targeted the nation\u2019s defense industry and removed it from the F-35 development program. Ankara has refused to jettison the S-400s as demanded by Washington, but it has high hopes that Trump could agree to amend the CAATSA to enable Turkey to buy F-35 jets built by Lockheed Martin Corp. Resolving the spat over the Russian S-400 missiles could lead to an unprecedented increase in defence-industry cooperation between the longtime allies. Outside of defense, Turkey has been considering an increase of liquefied natural gas imports from the US and is working to finalize an order for Boeing Co. aircraft.

Out of the 42 analysts who have coverage on Hero MotoCorp, 25 of them have a 'Buy' rating, 10 say 'Hold', while seven others have a 'Sell' recommendation. Brokerage firm JM Financial has re-initiated its coverage on Hero MotoCorp with a 'Buy' rating and a price target of \u20b9 The brokerage has factored in a moderate volume growth of 5% and 6% for FY26 and FY27. Hero MotoCorp expects domestic two-wheeler industry to grow by 6-7% in FY26, led by rural recovery, healthy monsoon prediction, reduction in income tax, and increased government spending. The management believes that Hero MotoCorp will outperform the underlying industry in both the domestic and exports segments, led by its upcoming product launches and entry into new geographies. On the margins front, the management has maintained its long-term guidance of 14-16%. However, ramp-up of EV volumes will be a drag on margins to some extent, JM Financial said in its note. Nuvama Institutional Equities has retained a 'Buy' rating with an unchanged price target of \u20b95,100. The brokerage said that Hero MotoCorp is well-placed to benefit from rural demand owing to its wide network. Recent launches\u2014Xpulse 210, Xtreme 250R, Xoom 125 and Destini 125 \u2014 are aimed at bolstering its position in the premium motorcycles and scooter markets. Furthermore, the company plans to launch two affordable E-2Ws in H1FY26E. Kotak Institutional Equities expects the two-wheeler industry growth momentum to moderate in FY26, led by the motorcycle segment. Also, it expects limited benefits to accrue to Hero Moto due to its higher exposure to the 110 cc segment. This, coupled with limited market share gains in premium and scooter segments, will weigh on the volume growth trajectory of the company, the brokerage said, while retaining a 'Sell' rating on the stock. However, Kotak has upped its price target to \u20b93,500 from \u20b93,400 earlier. The management, during the post-earnings call, said a strong wedding season in May and June is expected to boost two-wheeler sales. They also said that realisation improved largely due to a better product mix, with two-wheelers contributing two-thirds of the sequential improvement. Looking ahead, the management expressed confidence in outperforming industry growth, driven by new product launches. They expect the industry to grow by 6\u20137% in FY26. Additional tailwinds such as income tax relief and a higher number of marriage dates in 2025 are also expected to support demand. Shares of Hero MotoCorp are trading 4.45% higher on Thursday at \u20b94,248, having corrected 32% from its peak of \u20b96,245.

            "text": "HomeMarket NewsEarnings NewsHitachi Energy India aims to maintain double-digit margins in FY26 Hitachi Energy India expects to maintain double-digit margins for the financial year ending March 2026 (FY26), according to MD and CEO N Venu. Revenue from the High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) segment will be minimal this year, with most of it expected to be recognised in FY27 and FY28. Hitachi Energy India\u2019s primary focus continues to be the domestic market, supported by a robust pipeline spanning renewables, transmission, energy storage, and data centers. He also noted that the company\u2019s \u20b92,000 crore capex plan is already in progress, which will lead to an increase in installed capacity across the country. In the January\u2013March quarter of 2025 (Q4FY25), Hitachi Energy India reported revenue of \u20b91,884 crore, a net profit of \u20b9184 crore, and margins of 12.6%. These are the edited excerpts of the interview. Q: The HVDC order that you have bagged was a major announcement during the year that's now closed. What is the revenue recognition timeline? Over how many quarters will it come in? And when will it start contributing to stronger revenue growth? A: As you have seen, our results reflect our strategic focus and cyclical trends, delivering a very strong Q4. Let me give a 30-second overview of Q4 results : our orders were up by almost 56%, revenue increased by around 13% year-on-year, and our margin rose by 62%. Operational EBITDA came in at 12.3%. For the full year, our orders were up 228%, primarily due to bagging the HVDC order and other projects. Revenue was up 23%, driven by strong orders. We have consistently said on your channel that we are growing faster than the market in terms of order inflows. Once we have a strong backlog, it naturally converts into revenue over time\u2014as we have seen. Q: Just to clarify for our viewers, the revenue for FY25 was \u20b96,385 crore, and your EBITDA margins were already at a multi-year high of 9.3%. As the booking of the HVDC order begins, how will FY26's P&L profile look in terms of revenue and margins? A: We don't provide forward-looking statements. However, let me give you a marker. We have consistently said we aim to reach double-digit margins by the end of this financial year. In Q4, we already achieved that and plan to sustain it. While quarterly margins may vary, for FY26 as a whole, we expect to maintain double-digit margins. Our HVDC revenue for this year will be very small, but FY27 and FY28 will see the bulk of HVDC-related revenue being recognised. Q: So even without a significant HVDC contribution this year, you are saying margins will remain in the double digits. When you say \"double-digit,\" does that mean low teens or mid-teens? A: We don't want to give a specific number. We have said we will enter double digits and sustain that. Quarter-on-quarter can vary, but on an annual basis, we will maintain it. Q: While you focus on the business, markets sometimes factor in valuations, which could explain why the stock is down around 4%, despite strong performance. Now, about your order book: you have disclosed it at \u20b919,250 crore. But you haven\u2019t factored in the second HVDC order from the Adani Group, which I believe was signed in April 2025. That will be accounted for in Q1FY26. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that order could be worth \u20b911,000 crore, which would push your order book closer to \u20b930,000 crore. Is that about right? A: Yes, the other order is in the ballpark of \u20b98,000-10,000 crore. So if you add that, naturally the order book would be around that level. Q: So around \u20b929,000\u201330,000 crore is a fair estimate based on what you have disclosed and what will be disclosed at the end of Q1? A: Correct. Q: Services is a smaller part of your business, but you have now started disclosing it separately. How big can services become as a percentage of your business? And what about exports\u2014how much can they scale? A: Services and exports are two key levers for our top-line and bottom-line growth. Currently, services are in the low single digits, and we plan to take that to mid-range double digits. Based on our installed base, we see a potential \u20b92,000 crore order book opportunity in the next three to four years. We are currently at around \u20b9500\u2013600 crore. On exports, if you exclude HVDC, they currently make up 30\u201335% of total orders. We have consistently maintained we want to stay in the 25\u201330% range, and we are already there. That said, our main focus remains the domestic market, which has a strong pipeline\u2014not just in renewables but also in transmission, energy storage, and data centers. Also, as we have announced a \u20b92,000 crore capex, and many of those projects are already underway. This will increase our installed capacity in India. Q: I wanted to ask about that capex\u2014\u20b92,000 crore over the next four to five years. I believe the current cash on the books is \u20b93,800 crore? A: Yes, that is correct. Q: What capacity lines are you adding? What will be the incremental revenue and margin potential from this capex, and when will it come on stream? A: It won\u2019t happen overnight. We are looking at a four- to five-year horizon. We are expanding our large power transformer capacity and producing critical components like insulation material and bushings. We are also bringing new technologies to India\u2014for example, HVDC bushings, which are critical components. This will be implemented in phased manner. Generally, our asset turnover starts at 3\u20134x for these kinds of projects, potentially increasing over time. We are on track, and over the next four to five years, we plan to complete what we have committed. Q: A quick word on the data center opportunity. Can you quantify it? A: Data centers are a big opportunity. For every hyperscale data center, 15\u201320% of the capex is our addressable market. As of now, 1 out of every 3 data centers is powered by us, especially in grid connections. We aim to maintain that market share. Q: Back to HVDC for a moment. With a rough order book of \u20b930,000 crore (including the April order), what is the split between HVDC and non-HVDC? A: As of the end of last financial year, our order backlog was \u20b919,245 crore, which includes only one HVDC order. The April order hasn\u2019t been included yet and will be reflected at the end of Q1. So, the current backlog is largely non-HVDC, including data centers, industrial orders, services, and exports.

Amidst boycott calls across social media for trade and tourism with Turkiye and Azerbaijan, trade data from the DGCIS (Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics) has revealed that India's bilateral trade with both these countries has significantly declined in the past two financial years. India's exports to Turkiye from April to February in FY24-25 were recorded at $5.2 billion, which accounted for only about 1.5% of India's total exports of $437 billion. India's imports from Turkiye during the same period stood at $2.84 billion, which accounted for only 0.5% of India's total imports of $720 billion during the period. Similarly, India's exports worth $86.07 million during April to February in FY 2024-25 to Azerbaijan accounted for a mere 0.02% of India's total merchandise exports. Imports worth $1.93 million from Azerbaijan during the same period accounted for an even lesser share of 0.0002 % of India's merchandise imports during the period. India's overall merchandise trade with Turkiye has contracted to nearly 63% in FY24-25 from FY22-23 levels, from a positive trade balance of $5,400.85 million in FY22-23 to $2,721.9 million in FY24-25. India's overall merchandise trade with Azerbaijan contracted to 16% in FY24-25 from FY22-23 levels. India's merchandise trade with Azerbaijan witnessed a deficit worth $396.62 million in FY22-23, which turned into a positive trade balance of $91.75 million in FY24-25. Statistically, India's merchandise trade surplus has reduced with Turkiye while its trade balance has turned positive with Azerbaijan in the last two financial years. Recently, both countries criticised India's action against terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK), while Turkish drones were used by Pakistan to breach Indian airspace. While India's imports from Turkiye and Azerbaijan are already a minuscule part of its overall trade basket, there have been reports of Indian traders resorting to the boycott of apples and marble from Turkiye. An India-Turkiye Joint Commission on Economic and Technical Cooperation already exists between the countries. India primarily exports mineral fuels and oil (worth $960 million in FY23-24), auto parts, electrical machinery, organic chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastic, iron and steel rubber, cotton, man-made fibres and filaments to Turkiye, and imports mineral oil (worth $1.81 billion in FY23-24), gold, marble blocks and slabs, apples, vegetables, lime and cement, chemicals, and pearls from Turkiye. India was the third largest destination for crude oil from Azerbaijan in 2023, from which India also imports animal fodder, organic chemicals, raw hides, skins and leather, essential oils and perfumes. India's exports to Azerbaijan include tea, coffee, products, cereals, chemicals, plastic, rubber, paper and ceramics. The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), representing Indian traders nationwide, has also urged citizens to boycott travel to Turkey and Azerbaijan due to their support for Pakistan amid current hostilities. \u2018Boycott Turkey\u2019 has also been one of the persistent trends online as anger grows in India over Ankara\u2019s stance on Pakistan."

Amit Dahanukar, CMD of Tilaknagar Industries said that the company experienced a temporary slowdown in the second and third quarters of the previous year due to policy changes and the transition of the Andhra Pradesh government, including the privatisation of liquor retail in October. However, it made a strong recovery in the January-March quarter 2025 (Q4FY25), recording a 20% increase in volumes. Dahanukar added, \u201cThe growth in Andhra Pradesh would be in excess of that. That's looking more like 30-35% and with this strong momentum build up in quarter four, we are carrying this forward into quarter one and this fiscal year as well. We are very optimistic about the volume growth for this year.\u201d In January-March quarter 2025 (Q4FY25), Tilaknagar Industries reported a revenue of \u20b9406 crore, profit after tax at \u20b977 crore and margins of 19.3%. Tilaknagar Industries expects its net sales realisation (NSR) to remain largely stable in the current financial year. While the company is benefiting from the premiumisation trend and the sale of higher-end products, a price correction on its flagship brand in Andhra Pradesh\u2014implemented in November to stay competitive\u2014will have a full-year impact this year. As a result, NSR is projected to hold steady. It anticipates operating margins to stay in the range of 15.5% to 17% for the fiscal. The company is actively diversifying its portfolio beyond brandy, aiming to reduce brandy\u2019s contribution from 91% currently to around 80% by 2030. While brandy will remain the core of the business, the company is expanding into segments like premium whisky. On trade policy, Dahanukar noted that the company is not materially impacted by the UK-India Free Trade Agreement, given its limited exposure to imports. Tilaknagar Industries\u2019 current market capitalisation is \u20b96,481 crore. The stock is currently trading at \u20b9333.85 as of 9:50 am on the NSE and has gained 43% over the last year.

            "text": "HomeMarket NewsStocks To Buy: Birlasoft, Cyient shares have up to 40% upside potential, says this Anand Rathi chartist IT and Metal shares have been outperformers during the course of this week, ever since the US and China announced that they will be bringing down tariffs on their respective products, triggering a temporary pause in the tariff war between the two largest economies of the world. The Nifty IT index has risen nearly 5% in the last five trading sessions, with all index constituents gaining between 5% to 10%. The Nifty Metal index has also risen 9% in the last five trading sessions, with all index constituents gaining up to 12%. Amidst this outperformance, are there still stocks that command value or potential upside on the charts? Jigar Patel of Anand Rathi believes that SAIL is currently poised for upside towards \u20b9126 - \u20b9128 levels, which implies another 5% upside potential from current levels. \"The successful retest of a long-term falling trendline, indicates a shift in sentiment, indicating bullish momentum,\" he added. Patel sees support for SAIL around levels of \u20b9112, which will now act as a base and resistance at \u20b9128 levels. Anand Rathi's Patel is of the view that the \u20b9330 level could potentially mark a significant bottom for Birlasoft and this will be a critical level to monitor for a possible trend reversal. There is also a inverse head and shoulder pattern formed on the daily chart and a neckline breakout is seen with strong volumes. He recommends buying the stock between the \u20b9425 - \u20b9415 range, with a price target of \u20b9510. Stop loss should be placed at \u20b9375. The price target implies a potential upside of 20% from current levels. The other IT recommendation from Patel is Cyient, which is approaching a key technical inflection point, where multiple indicators are suggesting a potential trend reversal. \"This setup is supported by a powerful confluence of time cycles, Fibonacci ratios, and chart structure\u2014signaling a high-probability turning zone,\" he said. On the daily chart, Cyient has given breakout from Inverse Head & Shoulders pattern, which is a classic bullish reversal formation. He recommends buying Cyient for a price target of \u20b91,800, a stop loss of \u20b91,080 and a buying zone to be between \u20b91,240 - \u20b91,280.

CLSA has a \"underperform\" rating on Tata Power with a price target of \u20b9351 per share. The stock ended Wednesday's trading session at \u20b9396.95 apiece. The brokerage said Tata Power's fourth quarter earnings were weak, with Indonesian coal mines, the renewable energy (RE) independent power producer (IPP) business and Tata Projects, dragging the company's net profit lower by 5% from the previous year. CLSA also said that Tata Power's Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers (IPP) business remains impacted, as wind utilisation rates fell and interest rates rose. The RE IPP business is a key catalyst for Tata Power's prospects, according to CLSA. Profit per tonne for the coal business also halved from the same quarter last year due to a fall in seaborne coal prices. Tata Power's solar module business was the only bright spot that did well because of India's ban on solar module imports. At the current price, Tata Power's shares are trading at 26 times financial year 2026 price-to-earnings, which according to CLSA, is expensive. Of the 23 analysts that have coverage on the stock, 13 have a \"buy\" rating, three have a \"hold\" rating and seven have a \"sell\" rating. Tata Power reported a 24% increase in its consolidated net profit to \u20b91,306 crore, compared to \u20b91,045.6 crore in the year-ago period. Its revenue increased nearly 8% to \u20b917,096 crore.

Sofiya Qureshi remarks, gets pulled up in Supreme Court The Supreme Court on Thursday (May 15) slammed Madhya Pradesh Minister Kunwar Vijay Shah for his comments targetting Colonel Sofiya Qureshi. The court will hear his plea challenging the Madhya Pradesh High Court order initiating a suo motu case against him on Friday (May 16). \"What sort of statements are you making,\" the court asked the state Tribal Affairs Minister. The top court said, \"A person holding a constitutional office should be responsible when this country is going through such a situation. He has to know what he is saying.\" The MP Minister has also sought a stay of FIR in the apex court. The BJP leader and state Tribal Affairs Minister has sparked outrage with his derogatory comment targetting Col Qureshi. During his speech, Shah drew a connection between the Pahalgam terror attack, which left 26 people dead, and Operation Sindoor. An FIR was registered against the minister in the Indore district following the orders of the High Court. Superintendent of Police (rural) Hitika Vasal confirmed to PTI that the FIR has been registered. On May 12, Shah made the controversial statement during a public event in a rural area in Indore without taking Qureshi's name. Colonel Qureshi had shared the details of 'Operation Sindoor' launched by the Indian Armed Forces in regular press conferences. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh also attended these press conferences. After a huge controversy arose over this statement, Shah said that if anyone is hurt by his words, he is ready to apologise 10 times. He had also said that he respects Colonel Qureshi more than his sister. \"Sister Sofiya has brought glory to India by rising above caste and religion. She is more respected than our own sister. I salute her for her service to the nation. We cannot even think of insulting her in our dreams. Still, if my words have hurt society and religion, then I am ready to apologise 10 times,\" he said. Shah, who hails from the Harda region and claims to belong to a royal tribal family, has been facing fierce backlash across the country."

            "title": "Tata Power sees strong renewable growth continuing in FY26",
            "text": "HomeMarket NewsEarnings NewsTata Power sees strong renewable growth continuing in FY26 Mumbai-based electric utility Tata Power reported a nearly 47% year-on-year rise in profit after tax (PAT) from its renewable energy business and expects similar growth in the current financial year. Praveer Sinha, MD and CEO of Tata Power expects stable performance projected across its utility-scale, manufacturing, and rooftop segments. In the January\u2013March quarter of 2025 (Q4FY25), Tata Power reported revenue of \u20b917,096 crore, a net profit of \u20b91,042 crore, and margins of 19%. Tata Power believes competition in the cell manufacturing segment remains limited, given the current low capacity in the country. These are the edited excerpts of the interview. Q: My first question is on your capex. 2024-25 (FY25) capex was about \u20b916,200 crore, while you had guided for \u20b920,000 crore. What led to the shortfall? Was there a delay in capex spend? What can you guide on capex going ahead? A: You are right that we had planned a capex of \u20b920,000 crore for 2024-25. We were able to complete nearly \u20b916,200 crore during the year. Some of our projects got delayed, especially due to issues with the evacuation lines for renewable projects. They were slightly deferred, and will now be completed in Q1 of 2025-26 (FY26). Similarly, some transmission line projects we are executing had right-of-way issues, which have now been resolved and will be completed this quarter and next. So, it's just a matter of timing. We are very much on track to complete all these planned projects. Q: On renewables can you give us some sense of the revenue outlook? As you said, the issues that impacted performance in Q4 will be sorted. What should we expect from the renewable portfolio in terms of revenue growth and capacity addition this year? A: Last year, we added nearly 2,300 MW of capacity, out of which 1,000 MW was for our own utility-scale projects. This year, we have a much higher target, and these projects will be completed within this financial year. Also, last year, our cell and module plant was operational for a brief period. The module line ran longer, but the cell line operated briefly \u2014 only about 900 MW of cell production. In FY26, we expect this to exceed 3,700 MW. Our rooftop business has also picked up significantly. In fact, in the last quarter, the rooftop business generated profit after tax (PAT) of about \u20b9100 crore. If this trend continues, we can expect a very high number this financial year. So, all renewable businesses have started yielding very good results. On a year-on-year basis, there was nearly a 47% increase in PAT from the renewable business. We expect similar growth this year. The performance will be stable from renewable business - across utility-scale, manufacturing, and rooftop segments. Q: On solar, are you looking at exports at all? The big headline this quarter was the US imposing massive tariffs \u2014 almost 3,000% \u2014 on several ASEAN countries' solar cells and modules. Does this open up an opportunity for you on the export front? A: Right now, we have commitments to our own projects, which are DCR (Domestic Content Requirement) compliant. We also have obligations in rooftop and third-party EPC projects that we are executing. We expect to complete most of these within the next six months. Thereafter, we may explore export opportunities. There are great opportunities within the country, especially for third-party module sales, as DCR has been implemented across various sectors. We will evaluate whether it makes more business sense to sell domestically or to export. A decision will likely be made in the second half of the year. Q: Are you facing more competition in this segment? Some analysts have noted a decline in your market share. A: I don\u2019t think there is much competition at the moment, because cell manufacturing capacity is still very limited. We are one of the largest cell manufacturers in the country. While additional capacity is expected in the next one to two years, we currently have a strong market share and are well-positioned to cater to demand. Q: Let us talk about the discom business. Odisha has worked well for you and contributed to margin improvement in Q4. Can you share trends from the discom business for FY26? And regarding UP \u2014 the one everyone is watching \u2014 what timelines can we expect? A: Odisha has been a great success for us. Service improvements in reliability and customer experience have been significant. Many legacy issues, especially in billing and collections, have been resolved. We also managed to collect most of the outstanding payments last quarter. This trend will continue as systems, processes, and IT infrastructure are now well established. I expect Odisha to deliver even better results in the coming year. Regarding UP, the state government is keen on privatisation through a PPP model, similar to Odisha. From what I understand, a consultant has been appointed, bid documents are expected this month, and the bidding process should be finalised within this calendar year. Tata Power has unique experience in both urban and rural distribution, giving us a competitive edge. Q: At the end of Q4, your EBITDA margin rose to 19%. Solar and Odisha discom businesses seem to be driving this. Is this level sustainable? What margin profile should we expect for the year? And would UP, if acquired, be a drag initially? A: UP would only come into the picture later in the year. The margin improvement we have achieved is sustainable. Every quarter, we have delivered margin improvement on a solid foundation. Our core business performance has been exceptionally strong this year. That\u2019s the big shift at Tata Power \u2014 our core businesses are now delivering consistent and significant results, and we expect this trend to continue. Q: You have long maintained that you are not expanding your coal portfolio and aim to phase out thermal assets as PPAs expire, targeting zero thermal exposure by 2045. However, you have hinted at possible bids for stressed thermal assets. What is Tata Power\u2019s thermal strategy? A: As we have stated, many of our PPAs have end dates. When those end dates arrive, we plan to decommission those plants \u2014 we remain committed to that. At the same time, we recognise the short-term need for energy security. If a strong proposal for a stressed thermal asset comes up, we will evaluate it. This doesn\u2019t mean we are committing to it, but we will consider opportunities that align with our goal of becoming net zero by 2045. That commitment remains unchanged. Tata Power\u2019s current market capitalisation is \u20b91,26,711 crore. The stock is currently trading at \u20b9396.55 as of 10:14 am on the NSE and has declined 8% over the last year.

            "text": "Shares of state-run shipbuilder Cochin Shipyard Ltd. are trading with gains of as much as 7% on Thursday, May 15, ahead of the defence PSU's March quarter earnings. The stock is extending its gaining streak for the fifth day running. Cochin Shipyard is scheduled to announce its fourth quarter results today. The board will also consider the recommendation for a dividend. Brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities expects Cochin Shipyard to report a 39% revenue growth, driven by the execution of ASW Corvette and NGMV projects, and the ship repair segment. Kotak sees March quarter sales at \u20b91,702 crore, compared with \u20b91,226 crore year-on-year. The brokerage sees Q4 profit at \u20b9273.60 crore, up 4% YoY as against \u20b9264.70 crore in the same quarter a year ago. Ebitda margins may come in at 21.8%, driven by a higher contribution from ship repair. According to Antique Stock Broking, Cochin Shipyard's revenue growth is expected to remain healthy driven by short-cycle orders. It is targeting a sustained EBITDA margin of 20%\u201322% in the medium-term. The brokerage noted that a rise in the share of ship-repair business can positively rub-off on blended margins. However, higher depreciation may drag earnings growth in FY26 as the company has completed an \u20b92,800 crore capex programme in 2024. Antique also said that Cochin Shipyard's present order book stands at \u20b922,500 crore, which provides a revenue visibility of almost five years. As compared to Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders and Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Enginers, the company\u2019s order pipeline is relatively muted due to the deferral of IAC-II order. As a result, Antique expects the stock to underperform MDL and GRSE, given inferior revenue visibility. Out of five analysts tracking on Cochin Shipyard, three has a 'Buy' rating, while one each has a 'hold' and a sell' recommendation. Shares of Cochin Shipyard Ltd. are currently trading 5.23% higher at \u20b91,788.30. The stock has risen nearly 26% in the last five days."

He added that midcap and smallcap exposures have likely gone up over the past few weeks, driven by stock-specific opportunities across both growth and value. \u201cWe continue to ideate out there\u2026 we are pretty much there. We have only gained at not having actually disrupted the balance of our portfolios, despite the volatility.\u201d Badshah said sectors such as NBFCs, pharmaceuticals, industrials and defence are among Invesco\u2019s current bets. He also pointed to opportunities in midcap IT services, especially after the recent correction. On the macro side, Badshah said foreign investor flows into emerging markets may not be as India-centric going forward, with China also coming back into focus. \u201cThis time around, when flows return to emerging markets, there will be a favour of China too, will be a reasonably decent beneficiary\u2026 unlike, let\u2019s say, over the last two-three years, when generally India has dominated the scene.\u201d He said the evolving nature of the Chinese economy \u2014 with more weight on technology and automation \u2014 could attract foreign investors who may not find similar exposure in India. \u201cIt will be India plus China in terms of flows as we go along\u2026 especially if emerging market flows improve on aggregate.\u201d Badshah also maintained a constructive view on real estate and value retail, particularly in tier 2 and tier 3 markets. \u201cI like real estate\u2026 especially after this correction.

The streets of Hyderabad\u2019s Old City came alive with colour and celebration on Tuesday as contestants of Miss World 2025\u2014representing 109 countries\u2014were given a grand welcome at the city\u2019s historic Charminar and the vibrant Laad Bazar, also known as Chudi Bazar. The 400-year-old Charminar provided a majestic backdrop as the beauty queens arrived on a red carpet to the energetic rhythms of Marfa music, a percussion-driven sound deeply rooted in the culture of the region. The celebratory mood intensified as several contestants joined in the dancing, delighting onlookers who had gathered to witness the spectacle. A special photo shoot was organised at the monument, followed by a wave to the crowds from a stage set up near the site, drawing enthusiastic applause from the public. (Image: PTI) As part of a heritage walk, the contestants made their way to Laad Bazar for a curated shopping experience. The bustling market, famed for its bangles and pearl jewellery, showcased traditional craftsmanship through live demonstrations of bangle-making techniques. The Miss World delegates expressed admiration for the artisans\u2019 skill and attention to detail. (Image: PTI) According to officials, local shopkeepers welcomed the guests with roses and declined to accept payment for their purchases, encouraging the contestants to share the charm and cultural richness of Hyderabad in their home countries.

In India, Meta\u2019s largest market with over one billion monthly users across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, she manages expansion and strategy. Her new Southeast Asia responsibilities cover countries like Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, which have thriving digital economies and millions of Meta app users. Since taking charge in India, Devanathan has shaped Meta\u2019s approach, aligning it with global goals in generative AI, the metaverse, Threads, monetization, platform safety, and infrastructure. India is a key testing ground for Meta\u2019s innovations, with products like Instagram Reels (launched in India in 2020), Meta AI (highest usage in India), and WhatsApp Flows (announced for India in 2023) debuting there before global rollout. She has also driven Meta\u2019s growth in Singapore, Vietnam, and Southeast Asian e-commerce.

            "text": "HomeMarket NewsCommodities NewsGold prices slide to over one-month low: Is this start of a bigger correction Gold prices on Thursday (May 15) hit their lowest level in over five weeks, as easing geopolitical tensions and a shift toward riskier assets weakened the appeal of the safe-haven metal. The focus now shifts to upcoming US economic data, which could further influence the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy outlook. As of 0303 GMT, spot gold dropped 0.8% to $3,153.09 an ounce, after touching its lowest level since April 10 earlier in the session. US gold futures slipped 1% to $3,156.90 an ounce. In India, according to data from GoodReturns, 24 karat gold is priced at \u20b993,930 per 10 grams, 22 karat at \u20b986,100, and 18 karat gold at \u20b970,450. Data from Augmont\u2019s Bullion Daily Report shows gold has broken key support at $3,200 an ounce, confirming a bearish trend. Analysts now see further downside to $3,050\u20133,000 an ounce in the short term, equivalent to \u20b987,000\u201388,000 per 10 grams in domestic markets. Indian gold is expected to find support at \u20b991,350\u201390,780 per 10 grams and face resistance at \u20b992,450\u201392,690 per 10 grams. Rahul Kalantri, Vice President of Commodities at Mehta Equities, said, \u201cGold prices declined sharply due to profit-taking and liquidation by weaker hands. A shift toward riskier assets continues to pressure safe-haven demand. However, a weaker dollar index and uncertainty over long-term trade deals could lend support to gold at lower levels.\u201d The global decline comes as the United States and China agreed to reduce tariffs and observe a 90-day pause in trade tensions, temporarily removing a key driver of demand for bullion. Additionally, US President Trump\u2019s ongoing diplomatic efforts with South Korea, Japan, and India, along with reduced tensions in the Middle East, have collectively lowered geopolitical risk. Markets now await the US Producer Price Index (PPI) data due later on Thursday (May 15), and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech, which could offer more clarity on the timeline of potential rate cuts. A softer-than-expected consumer inflation report earlier this week has strengthened bets that the Fed may cut rates by 50 basis points this year\u2014likely starting in October rather than July. Gold generally performs well in a low interest rate environment, as it reduces the opportunity cost of holding the non-yielding asset. While the short-term trend appears weak, some analysts believe this correction could offer a good entry point for long-term investors. Gold may find a strong base around $3,100 an ounce and \u20b990,000 per 10 grams. Investors should monitor key macroeconomic cues before taking fresh positions, experts say.

US-based UnitedHealth, a manager of organised health systems, is a key client for Persistent and falls into the $100 million-plus relationship category, according to brokerage firm Dolat Capital. The company, which is also the largest constituent on the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index in terms of weightage, has been facing multiple headwinds over the last few months. Last month, the company had cut its Earnings per Share (EPS) guidance for the full year. Last week, the company suspended its guidance and also let go of its CEO, saying he had quit for personal reasons. The Wall Street Journal also reported on Thursday that UnitedHealth is currently under investigation for a potential Medicare fraud. As a result of this report, shares of UnitedHealth fell 8% in extended trading on Wall Street, having declined 18% on Tuesday and close to 1% on Wednesday as well. The stock has declined for seven straight trading sessions. Dolat Capital wrote in its note that 60% of Persistent Systems' revenue in financial year 2025 came from the healthcare segment and that near-term growth of the company will be skewed towards non-healthcare clients. The brokerage also said that rich valuations for Persistent pose a significant risk. Persistent Systems is currently trading at a financial year 2027 price-to-earnings multiple of 40.4 times, which is lower than the five-year average of 62.8 times. Out of the 23 analysts that have coverage on Persistent Systems, 13 of them have a \"buy\" rating on the stock, while seven have a \"hold\" rating. Three of them have a \"hold\" recommendation. Shares of Persistent Systems are trading 2.8% lower on Thursday at \u20b95,600. The stock still trades 17% below its 52-week high level of \u20b96,788."

            "text": "HomeWorld NewsIAEA dismisses nuclear leak rumours after India Pakistan clash The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has dismissed reports and speculations of radiation leaks from any nuclear facilities in Pakistan during the recent military escalation with India. The IAEA's clarification came after the Indian Air Force said it did not target Pakistan's Kirana Hills, which reportedly houses nuclear installations, The Indian Express reported, citing officials. The statement came after social media speculation and international media theories that a nuclear stockpile in Pakistan had been targeted during the attacks by India under Operation Sindoor. Speaking with The Indian Express on Tuesday, a spokesperson from the Vienna-based global nuclear watchdog said, \"We are aware of the reports you are referring to. Based on information available to the IAEA, there has been no radiation leak or release from any nuclear facility in Pakistan.\" The statement came in response to a query about potential nuclear incidents or spills reported to the IAEA's Incident and Emergency Centre. In addition, Principal Deputy Spokesperson Thomas Pigott was also asked about the matter at a US State Department press briefing in Washington, DC, on Tuesday, May 13. Pigott was questioned whether the US had sent a team to Islamabad due to reports of nuclear radiation leaks in secure sites. He responded, \"I have nothing to preview on that at this time.\" Earlier, Air Marshal A K Bharti stated that India did not hit Kirana Hills, saying, \"Thank you for telling us that Kirana Hills houses some nuclear installations. We did not know about it. We have not hit Kirana Hills. I did not brief in my briefing yesterday.\u201d External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal also rejected US President Donald Trump\u2019s claims of having averted a nuclear conflict between the two nations. He emphasised that India's military action was in the conventional domain and denied speculation about nuclear war, citing Pakistan's denial of the nuclear angle. \"The military action was entirely in the conventional domain. There were some reports that Pakistan\u2019s National Command Authority will meet on May 10. But this was later denied by them. Pakistan's Foreign Minister has himself denied the nuclear angle on record,\" Jaiswal said. \"As you know, India has a firm stance that it will not give in to nuclear blackmail or allow cross-border terrorism to be conducted invoking it. In conversations with various countries, we also cautioned that their subscribing to such scenarios could hurt them in their own region.\""

            "text": "HomeIndia NewsWith only 28% water stock, Maharashtra faces looming crisis despite monsoon hopes As the first signs of monsoon begin to appear, Maharashtra is already grappling with a worrying water situation. The data released by the State Water Resources Department stated that only 28.09% of the total water stock remains in the state's major dams \u2014 raising red flags for a potential water shortage in the coming weeks. Although this figure is slightly better than last year's 23.43% on the same day, the useful water stock fit and accessible for use \u2014 stands at only 8,166.17 million cubic metres (MCM). This limited availability could prove to be inadequate for drinking, agriculture, and industrial consumption until the monsoon arrives fully and consistently. Pune, one of the state's key urban regions, currently holds the lowest water stock among all divisions at just 21.52%. On the other end, Amravati has the highest reserve at 38.13%, followed by Konkan (34.15%), Nagpur (32.79%), Nashik (31.35%), and Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar (31.23%). These figures indicate a broad-based issue rather than an isolated one. The total water left in medium projects across the state is 38.98%, while small projects hold 31.55%, and large-scale state projects are down to 29.94%. Mumbai's reservoirs \u2014 which include Modak Sagar, Tansa, Vihar, Tulsi, Middle Vaitarna, Upper Vaitarna, and Bhatsa \u2014 currently hold just 19.17% of their total storage capacity. The city depends on these seven dams to supply around 4,000 million litres of water daily. Although the current level is better than last year's 13.63%, it's far from comfortable for a city of over 20 million people. In Nashik district, the overall dam stock is at 28.36%, amounting to 18,624 MCF (million cubic feet). The Gangapur dam, which supplies water to Nashik city, holds 44.40%, an improvement over last year's 33.45%. However, other dams in the region, like Alandi (12.62%), Kashyapi (35.58%), and Gautami Godavari (9%), are alarmingly low. The Manikpunj dam has completely dried up, and eight other dams are nearing dead storage levels. Water experts and state officials are closely monitoring the situation. While initial pre-monsoon showers have brought some relief in a few regions, consistent rainfall is yet to begin. Without timely and widespread rainfall, several districts could face severe water restrictions. Authorities are urging citizens to use water judiciously, avoid wastage, and prepare for possible water rationing. Farmers are also being advised to delay sowing until significant rainfall is recorded, to avoid crop loss due to inadequate water. With the monsoon expected to arrive in Maharashtra by early June, the next few weeks are critical. A below-normal monsoon or delayed rains could quickly turn this worrying trend into a full-blown water crisis."

            "text": "HomeWorld NewsWhat to know about the Menendez brothers\u2019 past, prison years, and parole future Lyle and Erik Menendez were 21 and 18 when they killed their parents. Now, at 57 and 54, the brothers are eligible for parole after a Los Angeles judge Tuesday reduced their sentences from life in prison without parole to 50 years to life. In August 1989, the brothers killed their father Jose Menendez and mother Kitty Menendez in their Beverly Hills home. While defense attorneys argued the brothers acted out of self-defense after years of sexual abuse by their father, prosecutors said they killed their parents for a substantial inheritance. The saga has captured the public's attention over the decades, spawning documentaries and television specials, as the brothers have lived out their adult years in incarceration. Here's what to know about their lives and what lies ahead: A wealthy upbringing After moving from New Jersey, the family settled into a multi-million dollar Spanish-style mansion in the wealthy Beverly Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles. Jose Menendez, was a powerful entertainment executive, and his wife, Kitty, a former beauty queen he met in college. At the time, Lyle was attending Princeton University but struggling academically, and Erik was a young tennis star. In the aftermath of the killings, the family discovered Jose Menendez's 1981 will, which left everything to the two brothers. An opinion from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals details the spending spree that Erik and Lyle went on, thinking they were poised to inherit millions. Lyle bought three Rolex watches, a Porsche 911 Carrera Cabriolet, and a restaurant in Princeton, New Jersey, while Erik purchased a Jeep Wrangler and hired a full-time tennis coach, according to the court document. The brothers addressed the lavish spending in a Netflix documentary, \"The Menendez Brothers,\" that came out last October. \"The idea that I was having a good time is absurd,\" Erik said in a recorded phone call from prison. \"Everything was to cover up this horrible pain of not wanting to be alive.\" The family said that in reality there was no inheritance \u2014 whatever assets Jose had were gobbled up by legal fees and taxes, and both of his properties were sold at a loss. Reunited after decades apart Lyle Menendez was transferred to the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego County in 2018, reuniting him with Erik Menendez, who was brought there in 2013. Before that Lyle spent decades housed at Mule Creek State Prison in northern California, while Erik was at Pleasant Valley State Prison in Coalinga, California. They could only keep in touch through letters. Anerae Brown, who spent time at both facilities as an inmate, described Pleasant Valley as a segregated and \"hyperviolent environment\" while testifying at the brothers' resentencing hearing. There was one instance where Brown was attacked by five men with weapons. Doing the things that Erik participated in, such as school and self-help classes, would put a target on one's back, Brown said. The brothers each got married in prison Lyle Menendez first married Anna Erickson, a former model, in 1996 before he surrendered to prison. They divorced in 2001. In 2008, he married attorney Rebecca Sneed. She announced on Facebook last November that the two had separated but \"remain best friends and family.\" She continues to run his Facebook page, where she has posted updates on the brothers' resentencing case. Erik Menendez married Tammi Menendez in 1999 after corresponding with her as a pen pal for years. She has a daughter from her first marriage, and both were at court Tuesday for the brothers' resentencing hearing. Conjugal visits are prohibited for those sentenced to life without parole under California law. Plans if released If the brothers are released from prison, their cousin, Diane Hernandez, and several family members said they would welcome the brothers into their homes. They also would immediately visit their aging aunts, Hernandez said. Joan VanderMolen, Kitty Menendez's sister, is now 93 and has been calling for Erik and Lyle's release since last fall. Her health has deteriorated since then, Hernandez said. Terry Baralt, Jose Menendez's sister, has been battling cancer and was recently hospitalized after attending a hearing in April. Her cancer recently advanced to Stage 4, her daughter said in court. Lyle Menendez said at his resentencing hearing Tuesday that he longs to reunite with his relatives. \"I look forward to be able to reunite with my extended family and continue the journey of healing that has sustained me through my incarceration,\" he said. The brothers have also indicated they would continue the work they started in prison that has supported fellow inmates to help others in society. Lyle said he hoped to advocate for survivors of sexual abuse and serve the incarcerated community. Tamara Goodell, another cousin, said in court that Lyle was excited to expand the Green Space Project he had started at the Richard J. Donovan facility to other prisons. The project was inspired by the Norwegian approach to incarceration that believes humane prison environments leads to more successful reintegration into society. Erik Menendez has said he would like to expand the Life Care and Hospice program he co-founded, which connects elderly and disabled inmates with younger inmates to serve as aids. \"At a certain point, something shifted in me,\" Erik said. \"I started living with purpose.\""

The local unit opened at 85.53 and quickly slipped to 85.64 at the interbank foreign exchange market. This marks a reversal from Wednesday\u2019s (May 14's) close of 85.32, when the rupee Equity markets extended their decline. The BSE Sensex fell 230.76 points to 81,099.80, while the NSE Nifty dropped 54.95 points to 24,611.95. Forex traders said investors are cautious ahead of US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech later in the day. His comments could offer clues on the future path of interest rate cuts. \u201cThe rupee\u2019s direction now hinges on Powell\u2019s tone. If the Fed turns more hawkish due to sticky inflation or tariff risks, the rupee may face further pressure,\u201d a currency trader with a Mumbai-based bank said. On Wednesday (May 14), India\u2019s wholesale inflation cooled to a 13-month low of 0.85% in April, raising expectations of a possible rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India in June. While rate cuts can support economic growth, they often weigh on the rupee due to reduced interest rate differentials and liquidity expansion. \u201cThe soft WPI print boosts hopes of policy easing, but short-term rupee weakness cannot be ruled out,\u201d said Amit Pabari, MD, CR Forex Advisors. Meanwhile, Asian currencies weakened and US Treasury yields rose. The 10-year US yield climbed to 4.55%, its highest in a month, amid fears that new US tariffs could stoke inflation, complicating the Fed\u2019s rate-cutting plans. Foreign investors bought \u20b9931.80 crore worth of Indian equities on Wednesday, data from exchanges showed. Outlook With Fed commentary, global yields, and domestic inflation dynamics in play, the rupee may remain volatile in the near term, experts say. Traders will watch Powell\u2019s remarks closely for fresh cues. -With inputs from PTI and Reuters"

            "title": "Trump's sanctions on ICC prosecutor have halted tribunal's work",
            "text": "HomeWorld NewsTrump's sanctions on ICC prosecutor have halted tribunal's work The International Criminal Court\u2019s chief prosecutor has lost access to his email, and his bank accounts have been frozen. The Hague-based court\u2019s American staffers have been told that if they travel to the U.S., they risk arrest. Some non-governmental organisations have stopped working with the ICC, and the leaders of one won\u2019t even reply to emails from court officials. Those are just some of the hurdles facing court staff since U.S. President Donald Trump in February slapped sanctions on its chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, according to interviews with current and former ICC officials, international lawyers and human rights advocates. The sanctions will \"prevent victims from getting access to justice,\u201d said Liz Evenson, international justice director at Human Rights Watch. Trump sanctioned the court after a panel of ICC judges in November issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant. Judges found there was reason to believe that the pair may have committed war crimes by restricting humanitarian aid and intentionally targeting civilians in Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in Gaza \u2014 charges Israeli officials deny. Staffers and allies of the ICC said the sanctions have made it increasingly difficult for the tribunal to conduct basic tasks, let alone seek justice for victims of war crimes or genocide. A spokesperson for the ICC and for Khan declined to comment. In February, ICC President Judge Tomoko Akane said that the sanctions \u201cconstitute serious attacks against the Court\u2019s States Parties, the rule of law based international order and millions of victims.\u201d The February order bans Khan and other non-Americans among the ICC\u2019s 900 staff members from entering the United States. It also threatens any person, institution or company with fines and prison time if they provide Khan with \u201cfinancial, material, or technological support.\u201d The sanctions are hampering work on a broad array of investigations, not just the one into Israel's leaders. The ICC, for example, had been investigating atrocities in Sudan and had issued arrest warrants for former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir on charges that include genocide. That probe has ground to a halt even as reports mount of new atrocities in Sudan, according to an attorney representing an ICC prosecutor who is fighting the sanctions in U.S. courts. The prosecutor, Eric Iverson, filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration seeking protection from the sanctions. Also Read: Qatar Airways signs deal for 160 Boeing jets during Trump visit Her client \"cannot do, what I would describe as, basic lawyer functions,\u201d said Allison Miller who is representing Iverson in the suit. American staffers at the organization, like Iverson, have been warned by its attorneys that they risk arrest if they return home to visit family, according to ICC officials. Six senior officials have left the court over concerns about sanctions One reason the court has been hamstrung is that it relies heavily on contractors and non-governmental organisations. Those businesses and groups have curtailed work on behalf of the court because they were concerned about being targeted by U.S. authorities, according to current and former ICC staffers. Microsoft, for example, cancelled the Khan\u2019s email address, forcing the prosecutor to move to Proton Mail, a Swiss email provider, ICC staffers said. His bank accounts in his home country of the United Kingdom have been blocked. Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment. Staffers at a non-governmental organization that plays an integral role in the court\u2019s efforts to gather evidence and find witnesses said the group has transferred money out of U.S. bank accounts because they fear it might be seized by the Trump administration. Senior leadership at two other U.S.-based human rights organizations told the AP that their groups have stopped working with the ICC. A senior staffer at one told the AP that employees have even stopped replying to emails from court officials out of fear of triggering a response from the Trump administration. The cumulative effect of such actions has led ICC staffers to openly wonder whether the organisation can survive the Trump administration, according to ICC officials who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal. Said one such official: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how the court makes it through the next four years.\" Trump, a staunch supporter of Netanyahu, issued his sanctions order shortly after re-taking office, accusing the ICC of \u201cillegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel.\u201d Washington says the court has no jurisdiction over Israel. Trump\u2019s order said the ICC\u2019s \u201cactions against Israel and the United States set a dangerous precedent, directly endangering current and former United States personnel, including active service members of the Armed Forces.\u201d He said the court\u2019s \u201cmalign conduct\u201d threatens \u201cthe sovereignty of the United States and undermines the critical national security and foreign policy work of the United States Government.\u201d The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Netanyahu has dismissed the ICC's allegations as \u201cabsurd,\u201d and Israel\u2019s Knesset is considering legislation that would make providing evidence to the court a crime. Israel launched its offensive after Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel in October 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting scores of others. Hamas is believed to be holding about two dozen hostages. Inside the court, staffers have been coping with dark humor, joking about how they cannot even loan Khan a pen or risk appearing on the U.S. radar. This is not the first time the ICC has drawn Trump\u2019s ire. In 2020, the former Trump administration sanctioned Khan\u2019s predecessor, Fatou Bensouda, and one of her deputies over the court\u2019s investigation into alleged crimes committed in Afghanistan while the United States military was operating in the country. President Joe Biden rescinded the sanctions when he took office several months later. Three lawsuits are now pending from U.S. court staff and consultants against the Trump administration arguing that the sanctions infringe on their freedom of expression. Earlier this week Iverson, the lawyer investigating genocide in Sudan, won temporary protection from prosecution but if other U.S. citizens at the court want a similar assurance, they would have to bring their own complaint. Meanwhile, the court is facing an increasing lack of cooperation from countries normally considered to be its staunchest supporters. The ICC has no enforcement apparatus of its own and relies on member states. In the last year, three countries \u2013 including two in the European Union \u2013 have refused to execute warrants issued by the court. The renewed assault from the Trump administration comes as the court was already facing internal challenges. Last year, just weeks before Khan announced he was requesting arrest warrants for the Israeli officials, two court staff reported the British barrister had harassed a female aide, according to reporting by the Associated Press. Khan has categorically denied the accusations that he groped and tried to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship. A United Nations investigation is underway, and Khan has since been accused of retaliating against staff who supported the woman, including demoting several people he felt were critical of him.

Starting April 2025, key labour force indicators for the quarterly PLFS results will cover rural areas. The April\u2013June 2025 quarterly PLFS results, inclusive of rural jobs data, will be released in August 2025. And, thereafter, in November and February, for the second and third quarters. In another key change, the MoSPI is transitioning to calendar year-based annual reporting for PLFS results, replacing the earlier July\u2013June cycle. This will align employment statistics with other economic datasets for improved comparability and make it more current. To boost accuracy and representation, the MoSPI has decided to significantly enlarge the survey\u2019s sample size as well. The number of households covered will increase from 1,02,400 to 2,72,304\u2014a 2.65-fold rise\u2014ensuring district-level representation for the first time. As indicated by the MoSPI earlier, employment data from the PLFS for urban areas will be released monthly. Starting April 2025, the data will be released on May 15, thereby the 16th of every month."

            "text": "HomeMarket NewsREC analyst still finds value in the PSU despite cutting price target by 13% Shares of REC Limited opened flat on Thursday, May 15, before slipping to a day's low of \u20b9387.75. The stock has since recovered slightly and is now trading 1% higher. Brokerage firm Emkay Global reiterated its 'Buy' rating on REC, while revising its price target down by 13% to \u20b9525 from \u20b9600 earlier. The new target implies an upside potential of 35% from current levels. REC reported a soft quarter, with moderated growth and disbursements driven by higher repayments, including prepayments, and NPA resolutions. However, margins and asset quality remained stable. The company's net profit rose 5.5% from last year to \u20b94,236 crore, while its core income or Net Interest Income (NII) grew 37.6% on a year-on-year basis to \u20b95,877 crore. REC has cut its growth guidance for its Assets Under Management (AUM) during its earnings call on May 14. The company now expects its AUM to grow between 11% and 13% from 15% and 17% projected earlier. Additionally, the management on its earnings call also mentioned that it is targeting a loan book of \u20b910 lakh crore by 2030, through an annual loan book growth of 12%. REC expects its margins continues to be in the range of 3.5% to 3.75% going forward. The management of the Maharatna PSU also said that they are targeting a net zero NPA status by financial year 2026. The company's board also proposed a final dividend of \u20b92.6 per share, taking the total payout for the full financial year 2025 to \u20b918 per share. To reflect the Q4 performance and management commentary, Emkay has revised down its growth estimates, resulting in a 7\u20139% cut in AUM and a 4\u20137% reduction in earnings per share (EPS) for FY26\u201327E. Following the recent correction, REC shares are now trading at a price-to-book ratio of 1.0x for FY26E. With an 18% return on equity and a 5% dividend yield, the risk-reward remains favourable. Emkay said that the price target and valuation multiple cuts are largely driven by the moderation in growth, although it continues to see value in the stock. Shares of REC Limited settled 2.92% lower on Wednesday at \u20b9390. The stock is down 23% so far this year.

The coffee chain sent out letters via a financial adviser to several potential investors this week to solicit views on the China business and how to grow it, the people said, asking not to be identified because the process is private. A transaction could value the assets at several billion dollars, the people said. Bloomberg News reported previously that Starbucks was assessing its operations in China, its second-biggest market. The company has warned of macroeconomic and competitive pressures in the country, where the likes of Luckin Coffee Inc. and Cotti Coffee have emerged as major homegrown players. Starbucks, which had more than 7,750 stores in China as of the end of March, generated about $740 million net revenue in the country in the quarter through March. Luckin\u2019s net revenue was $1.2 billion in the same period. Prospective bidders are expected to submit initial feedback in the next few weeks, the people said. Starbucks may also decide not to do a deal, they said. A representative for Starbucks said the company didn\u2019t have any comment beyond what has already been shared publicly, referencing a late April earnings call by Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol, when he said there was evidence of progress in China following changes to product offerings and prices. \u201cWe remain committed to China for the long term,\u201d Niccol said at the time. \u201cWe see great potential for our business there in the years ahead and remain open to how we achieve that growth.\u201d Niccol also said in October that said Starbucks was exploring partnerships to help it over the long term, without elaborating. Both McDonald\u2019s Corp. and Yum! Brands Inc., the parent of KFC, sold stakes in their China operations to PE firms to tap growth and better cater to local tastes. In 2023, McDonald\u2019s agreed to buy back Carlyle Group Inc.\u2019s minority stake in a partnership that runs the chain\u2019s business in China, Hong Kong and Macau.

Analysts tracking the stock remain divided on the stock's prospects going forward. At the end of its earnings call, Muthoot Finance maintained its gold loan guidance for financial year 2026 at 15%, adding that the guidance will be reviewed at the end of the ongoing quarter. The management said that the gold loan pie has increased, market is widening and that the RBI guidelines appear targeted at newer players due to a surge in gold prices, as old players like them continue to follow the norm. Brokerage firm Jefferies has a \"buy\" recommendation on Muthoot Finance, with a price target of \u20b92,660. It said that although the company's standalone gross NPA and credit costs fell from the previous quarter, the gross NPA among MFI subscribers increased. \"Higher gold prices should cushion the drag from potentially tighter LTV norms and support healthy growth,\" Jefferies wrote, adding that Muthoot should also benefit from the ongoing rate cut scenario from the Reserve Bank of India. The brokerage called Muthoot a defensive asset-quality play, anticipating limited loan losses and it expects Muthoot's net profit and Return on Equity (RoE) to grow at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 21% and 20% respectively, over financial year 2025-2027. Bernstein also has an \"outperform\" rating on Muthoot Finance with a price target of \u20b92,500. It stated while Muthoot's NIMs moderated, a sharp decline in credit costs helped maintain its Return on Assets at 5.8%. On the flip side, Morgan Stanley has an \"equal-weight\" rating on Muthoot with a price target of \u20b92,400. It said that financial year 2026 promises to be another year of strong earnings growth, but risk-reward currently is balanced for the company.

Bullion traded above $3,182 an ounce on Thursday, near the lowest level in more than a month. Yields on US Treasuries climbed on expectations the Fed will lower borrowing costs later than thought due to an improving economic outlook following the US-China trade truce. Higher yields and rates tend to be negative for non-interest bearing gold. Continued progress in US-led trade talks also added to bearish headwinds for the precious metal, with China suspending curbs on exports of rare earths and other goods and technologies on Wednesday. The d\u00e9tente between the world\u2019s two largest economies has reduced gold\u2019s haven appeal and led to a sharp rebound in risk assets this week. Gold is still up more than 20% this year, however, with prices peaking at a record above $3,500 an ounce in April. Investors had feared trade tensions stemming from Trump\u2019s tariffs could spur faster inflation and a slowdown in growth, or even a recession. Spot gold rose 0.2% to $3,182.85 an ounce as of 8:04 a.m. in Singapore. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was steady. Silver and platinum were steady, while palladium edged higher."

Stocks like Hindustan Aeronautics and Bharat Electronics have seen the largest addition in market capitalisation terms, while Garden Reach has been the biggest gainer in percentage terms. Defence stocks have been in the spotlight since tensions rose between India and Pakistan across the border after the terrorist attack at Pahalgam in Jammu & Kashmir, which culminated in Operation Sindoor, where India's defence system thwarted multiple attempts from across the border to attack the country's air bases. India's defence companies were also praised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the nation on Tuesday, May 13, where he also said that the time has come for defence equipments that are \"Made in India.\" India's defence exports have also seen a sharp surge to \u20b923,622 crore in financial year 2025, a 12% growth from the previous figure of \u20b921,083 crore. In a post on \"X\" the Ministry of Defence posted that India is aiming for \u20b950,000 crore in defence exports to over 80 countries by over 2029. The number is also a 34 times increase from the financial year 2014 figure of \u20b9686 crore. Defence stocks like Garden Reach and Hindustan Aeronautics also reacted to their quarterly results on Wednesday, while stocks like Cochin Shipyard will be reporting their results during Thursday's trading session. \"I think some of the defence names are definitely looking interesting. And if you look at something like Garden Reach Shipyard, it's looking pretty good. I was already bullish on Mazagon Dock, but it's a bit late now. Garden Reach possibly could mimic Mazagon Dock\u2019s moment. And as a sector as such, I'm more bullish on the capital goods space, where some of the defence stocks are also there.

Cohen was removed from the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing, where Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was testifying. \u201cYou\u2019re killing poor kids in Gaza and paying for it by cutting Medicaid for kids here,\u201d Cohen shouted from the public gallery before being escorted out by police with his hands tied behind his back. \u201cLet food into Gaza,\u201d he added as he was led away, according to videos posted online by Cohen. The Capitol Police said Cohen was charged under a District of Columbia code that prohibits crowding, obstructing or incommoding \u2014 a citation often used in civil disobedience cases in the capital. Six other demonstrators arrested at the hearing face more serious charges, including assaulting a police officer, according to Capitol Police. Cohen, a longtime progressive activist, co-founded Ben & Jerry\u2019s in 1978 with Jerry Greenfield. The Vermont-based brand is known for its quirky flavors and outspoken political positions. Ben & Jerry\u2019s is currently embroiled in a legal fight with its parent company, Unilever PLC.

Brent dropped toward $65 a barrel, after declining 0.8% on Wednesday, while West Texas Intermediate traded near $62. Iran is ready to sign an agreement with certain conditions, NBC reported, citing Ali Shamkhani, a top adviser to the OPEC nation\u2019s supreme leader. Crude declined Wednesday after government data showed US stockpiles rose the most since March, ending a four-day rally that had seen it gain almost 10%. The advance had been driven by the trade truce between China and the US and President Donald Trump\u2019s increasingly hostile rhetoric on Iranian supply. Oil is still down by around 13% this year, and US producers have said they expect little change in prices before year-end. Increased flows from Iran would add to a potential glut later this year after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies last month began restoring supplies idled since 2022. The group added only 25,000 barrels a day in April, a fraction of the scheduled 138,000 barrels a day, according to a monthly report released Wednesday. The alliance will consider another output increase at a June 1 meeting. The International Energy Agency, which advises consuming nations and publishes forecasts that are more closely watched by oil traders than OPEC\u2019s, will release its latest estimates of supply and demand later on Thursday in Paris.

Japanese and Australian stocks edged lower, while a gauge of US-listed Chinese companies climbed 1.2% on Wednesday. Tencent Holdings Ltd.\u2019s revenue grew at its fastest pace in more than three years. An index of the dollar rose Wednesday, reversing selling pressure earlier in the session as Bloomberg News reported the US is not working to include currency policy pledges in trade accords. Gold steadied on Thursday after falling 2.3% to a one-month low in its previous session. Oil fell for a second day after a government report showed US crude inventories rose the most in two months. The moves reflected a note of caution to a week marked by a sharp rebound in risk assets fueled by progress in trade talks and economic resilience. The nascent US-China trade truce, a UK pact and high-profile Gulf deals have reassured investors, yet lurking in the background is the worry that stocks get so extended that they\u2019re vulnerable to surprises. \u201cAs trade tensions ease, investors are pivoting back to fundamentals, but they may not like what they see,\u201d said Mark Hackett at Nationwide. \u201cThe market has raced from oversold to overbought in record time. That limits near-term upside unless we see a clear re-acceleration in growth.\u201d In further signs of thawing trade tensions, China on Wednesday suspended curbs on exports of rare earths and other goods and technologies for military use. The move follows an agreement by the Asian nation and the US to temporarily lower tariffs levied against each other\u2019s products and will last for 90 days, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement. Elsewhere, traders will be watching for further moves in the won after a report that the US and South Korean governments discussed currency policies this month. The won jumped more than 1% and neighboring currencies, including the Japanese yen, also rose. Data set for release in the region includes trade for India and Indonesia, money supply for South Korea, and employment for Australia. Interest-Rate Bets Selling in US government debt across the curve sent the 10-year yield seven basis points higher to around 4.54%, around the highest in a month, as Federal Reserve rate-cut bets receded. Fed Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said that it\u2019s important for central bankers not to respond to day-to-day volatility in equities and economic policy pronouncements, noting that economic data remain steady for now. Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson said tariffs and related uncertainty could slow growth and boost inflation this year, but monetary policy is well positioned to respond as needed. \u201cFed vice chair Jefferson\u2019s speech today leans a little dovish after a run of more hawkish commentary from Fed officials, signaling that the Fed leadership is (sensibly) wary of calling the all-clear on downside risk even after US-China de-escalation,\u201d said Krishna Guha at Evercore. The modest advance for US stocks on Wednesday covered up a broadly down day for most sectors. Big tech was the key exception, alongside a mix of individual names. Boeing Co. rallied on its largest-ever deal after Qatar Airways placed an order for long-range jets during a visit to Doha by Donald Trump. To Rick Gardner at RGA Investments, the stock-market rally has legs. \u201cThe trade negotiation with China was seemingly the toughest one on the docket, and the idea that there has been this much progress on the negotiations over such a short period of time, suggests that a resolution may be on the horizon,\u201d he said.

The Justice Department has had a probe into the company\u2019s Medicare Advantage business since at least last summer, according to the people. The nature of the potential criminal allegations against the insurer isn\u2019t clear, the newspaper said, citing the people. UnitedHealth\u2019s shares fell more than 8% in postmarket trading in New York. UnitedHealth didn\u2019t respond to questions from the WSJ, while a spokesman for the Department of Justice declined to comment to the newspaper. UnitedHealth representatives also didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment from Bloomberg on Wednesday. The report comes just after the insurer unexpectedly replaced its chief executive officer and suspended earnings guidance, a second surprise for investors after it cut its annual forecast. The move piled further doubt on the company\u2019s strategy to focus on Medicare, which pushed profit growth for years but has recently faltered. In addition to those headwinds, UnitedHealth also faces growing scrutiny in Washington, as antitrust regulators challenge its planned purchase of home health operator Amedisys Inc. Insurers\u2019 Medicare Advantage practices have drawn questions in recent years. Companies get paid more for taking care of sicker patients in the program, with rates determined by the diagnosis codes they submit. Watchdogs and whistleblowers have accused insurers of exaggerating how sick their patients are to boost profits, and some firms have paid large sums to resolve cases. UnitedHealth faced allegations in a long-running civil Medicare fraud case that it improperly overcharged the US government by more than $2 billion. The company in March received a favorable finding in that case, bringing it a step closer to winning potential dismissal."

Foot Locker's shares ended Wednesday's regular trading session at $12.87, a drop of over 3%, giving it a market value of $1.2 billion.

At the close of extended trade at 8 PM EST, shares of Foot Locker had surged 69% to $21.78. A final agreement is yet to be reached, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. Foot Locker has a target of $9.5 billion in annual sales by 2026 but revenue for the most recent year, which ended on February 1, fell for the third year in a row to less than $8 billion, as discretionary spending sputters in the US. Foot Locker also has an India connection courtesy of its partnerships with listed entities like Metro Brands and FSN E-commerce Ventures, parent company of the beauty and fashion e-tailer Nykaa. During its December quarter earnings call, the Metro Brands management told analysts that they remain conservative in projections of new stores for Foot Locker, given the uncertainties of the BIS regulations. The management said that they have three more stores lined up for launch, having launched the first one in October last year and also having opened the largest Crocs store in Kochi. \u201cIf the purchase goes through, Dick\u2019s would be inheriting a business that remains on the back foot,\u201d said Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData. \u201cThe comeback is not yet fully in play.\u201d Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods tumbled 6% in extended trading after the Wall Street Journal newsbreak.

            "text": "HomeMarket NewsUS Stock Market Live: Dow futures down 200 points; Trump says in 'very serious' discussions with Iran for peace US Stock Market Live: US stock futures, particularly the Dow Jones are trading under pressure, as the risk-on rally appeared to have faltered on Wall Street. The Dow Jones futures are down 200 points, while those on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are trading just below the flat line. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained for the third day in a row on Wednesday, led by megacap tech shares, which have risen between 10% and 20% so far this week. A major reason for the fall on the Dow futures is its biggest index constituent - UnitedHealth. The stock fell 8% in extended trading after the Wall Street Journal reported that the company is under investigation for a potential Medicare fraud. The US Dollar pared back losses after the US clarified it is not using the currency as a bargaining tool for trade deals. Gold fell to a one-month low. The US will report wholesale inflation, retail sales and Walmart earnings later this evening. Watch this space for all the Live updates. Thyssenkrupp shares fell as much as 14% in early Frankfurt trading on Thursday. The stock has more than doubled this year as it benefits from rising defense spending in Europe. US and Chinese officials met for trade talks in South Korea on Thursday, just days after both sides met in Switzerland and agreed to pause some tariffs for 90 days. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer sat down with China\u2019s chief trade representative Li Chenggang in Jeju, South Korea, according to a South Korean official with knowledge of the matter. No other details have been provided yet and the US Embassy in Seoul didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request to confirm the meeting. The truce in the ongoing trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies has brought some relief to companies, many of which have been hit hard by rising costs due to the tit-for-tat tariffs. Still, the suspension is only temporary, and firms also have to consider what happens to tariffs affecting South Korea, Japan, Vietnam and other nations that the US announced and then suspended. Shein Group Ltd. lowered US retail prices this week after the Trump administration temporarily cut duties on Chinese imports, as the online fashion retailer moves to win back consumers scared away by recent tariff-induced price hikes. Shein also sent a price drop alert to US consumers Wednesday touting lowered prices across a range of styles, and promising that shoppers wouldn\u2019t be asked to pay any tariff-induced fees or additional costs at checkout. PDD Holdings Inc.-owned rival Temu adopted import surcharges for goods shipped directly from China in late April. Deliveries are also suffering, the investment bank said, with volumes down sequentially over the past four weeks, from 7,200 in the third week of April to just 5,200 units in the second week of May. China has suspended a ban on exports of items with both military and civil applications \u2014 likely including some rare earths \u2014 to 28 US companies as part of the trade detente struck between the world\u2019s two largest economies. The move follows an agreement by China and US to temporarily lower tariffs levied against each other\u2019s products \u2014 the first major de-escalation in the trade row that was touted by US President Donald Trump as a \u201ctotal reset\u201d of bilateral ties. Stocks and the dollar surged as prospects of a resolution offered relief to investors. Gold steadied after falling more than 2% Wednesday on signs there will be fewer Federal Reserve rate cuts than previously anticipated, and as easing US-China tensions sapped haven demand. Bullion traded above $3,182 an ounce on Thursday, near the lowest level in more than a month. Yields on US Treasuries climbed on expectations the Fed will lower borrowing costs later than thought due to an improving economic outlook following the US-China trade truce. Higher yields and rates tend to be negative for non-interest bearing gold. Continued progress in US-led trade talks also added to bearish headwinds for the precious metal, with China suspending curbs on exports of rare earths and other goods and technologies on Wednesday. The detente between the world\u2019s two largest economies has reduced gold\u2019s haven appeal and led to a sharp rebound in risk assets this week. While Chinese stocks have rallied following the agreement, recouping their losses since the April 2 volley of tariff announcements, global investors appear to be staying on the sidelines. Market expectations on further government support have been tempered given the better-than-expected outcome of tariff negotiations last weekend. \u201cThe upside appears limited unless we see further policy support or a clear improvement in earnings, as much of the recent good news is already reflected in prices,\u201d said Eva Lee, head of Greater China equities at UBS Global Wealth Management. \u201cMajor headwinds would be the negotiation takes longer than expected while China didn\u2019t offer effective stimulus measures to stabilize the economy.\u201d The nature of the potential criminal allegations against the insurer isn\u2019t clear, the newspaper reported, citing the people. UnitedHealth\u2019s shares fell more than 8% in postmarket trading in New York. Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Inc. is in advanced talks to buy Foot Locker Inc., whose stock had dropped 41% this year amid the back-and-forth over tariffs, according to people familiar with the matter. The stock surged 69% in extended trading. Under the transaction being discussed, Dick\u2019s would pay $24 a share for Foot Locker, one of the people said. A deal could be announced as soon as Thursday, said the people, asking not to be identified because the talks were private. Oil fell for a second day following a report Iran is willing to forgo nuclear weapons in a deal with the US in exchange for sanctions relief. Brent dropped toward $65 a barrel, after declining 0.8% on Wednesday, while West Texas Intermediate traded near $62. Iran is ready to sign an agreement with certain conditions, NBC reported, citing Ali Shamkhani, a top adviser to the OPEC nation\u2019s supreme leader. Crude declined Wednesday after government data showed US stockpiles rose the most since March, ending a four-day rally that had seen it gain almost 10%. The advance had been driven by the trade truce between China and the US and President Donald Trump\u2019s increasingly hostile rhetoric on Iranian supply. Stocks in Asia fell on Thursday for the first time in five sessions as the rally on Wall Street sparked by US-China trade talks showed signs of exhaustion. Japanese and Australian stocks edged lower, while a gauge of US-listed Chinese companies climbed 1.2% on Wednesday. Tencent Holdings Ltd.\u2019s revenue grew at its fastest pace in more than three years. An index of the dollar rose Wednesday, reversing selling pressure earlier in the session as Bloomberg News reported the US is not working to include currency policy pledges in trade accords. Gold steadied on Thursday after falling 2.3% to a one-month low in its previous session. Oil fell for a second day after a government report showed US crude inventories rose the most in two months. Wall Street\u2019s epic rebound from April\u2019s meltdown is showing signs of exhaustion on speculation stocks have run too fast amid risks stemming from a trade war to an economic slowdown and sticky inflation. After a 22% jump from last month\u2019s intraday lows, the S&P 500 edged up just 0.1%. Most sectors fell, but big tech climbed. Boeing Co. gained on its largest-ever deal, with Qatar Airways placing an order for long-range jets during a visit to Doha by Donald Trump. The Nasdaq 100 added 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2%. A gauge of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d megacaps climbed 1.7%. The dollar erased losses as Bloomberg News reported the US is not working to include currency policy pledges in trade accords. Bond yields rose as Federal Reserve rate-cut bets receded. US stock futures, particularly the Dow Jones are trading under pressure, as the risk-on rally appeared to have faltered on Wall Street. The Dow Jones futures are down 200 points, while those on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are trading just below the flat line. Welcome to CNBC-TV18\u2019s Live coverage of the global equity markets, and on Wall Street. Futures are taking a breather after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained for the third straight day on Wednesday. Dow Jones continued to underperform."

            "text": "HomeMarket NewsSEBI bars Varyaa Creations from securities market, halts lead manager amid IPO proceeds irregularities The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has barred Varyaa Creations Limited from the securities market after finding that the company diverted IPO proceeds meant for business purposes. VCL, a company engaged in the wholesale trading of precious metals and jewellery, listed its shares on the SME Platform of BSE Ltd. on April 30, 2024. SEBI also found that merchant banker Inventure Merchant Banker Services failed in its due diligence duties by allowing these fund movements without scrutiny. It has been restrained from taking on new IPO assignments. SEBI initiated the inquiry after discovering irregularities during its routine inspection of Inventure\u2019s activities. During the inquiry, SEBI found that more than 70% of the proceeds from the IPO (\u20b914 crore) were transferred on the day of listing, April 30, 2024, to three entities\u2014Maruti Corporation, Kaveri Corporation, and Overseas Metal and Alloys Pvt Ltd.\u2014under the instructions of Inventure. These transfers, made in the guise of covering issue-related expenses, raised concerns as they were disproportionate to the disclosed expenses in the IPO's prospectus. VCL and Inventure were asked to explain the transfers, but VCL failed to provide a satisfactory response, citing the unavailability of its accounts team. The lead manager, Inventure, defended the transactions, stating that they were in line with the stated objectives of the IPO, including the purchase of inventory and corporate purposes. Upon further investigation, SEBI found discrepancies in the use of the funds, noting that payments made to Kaveri Corporation, a sole proprietorship in the agriculture sector, and Overseas Metal and Alloys Pvt Ltd., did not align with the stated objectives of the IPO, particularly the opening of a new showroom in Agra. The transfer of funds and their subsequent withdrawal in cash raised red flags about the authenticity and purpose of the transactions. As a result, SEBI issued interim directions, including freezing the shareholding of certain individuals involved and restraining Inventure from taking up new assignments in merchant banking. The regulator has also instructed that a monitoring agency be appointed for any ongoing projects involving Inventure."

            "text": "HomePersonal Finance NewsInvesting in global funds offer hedge, diversification and access to growth sectors, say experts In today\u2019s volatile markets, both in India and abroad, global investing has become more than just an option\u2014it\u2019s an important strategy for long-term wealth creation. According to Niranjan Avasthi, Senior Vice President at Edelweiss Mutual Fund, \u201cIf you want winning markets in your portfolio, you need to invest beyond India.\u201d He points out that while India has performed well in recent years, the US and China have consistently delivered strong returns and dominate global market capitalisation. One hidden advantage of global investing is currency depreciation. \u201cThe rupee has depreciated 3% to 4% annually against the dollar over the last 30 years,\u201d Avasthi said. \u201cThe S&P 500 returned 12.75% in dollar terms over the past decade, but in rupee terms, it gave 16%.\u201d That difference, he explains, is purely from currency movement\u2014an added benefit for Indian investors holding dollar-denominated assets. Nasser Salim, Managing Director of Flexi Capital, agrees. \u201cGlobal funds need to be part of your portfolio,\u201d he said, citing four reasons: geographic diversification, access to sectors absent in India, currency hedging, and market-cycle balance. He emphasises that international assets act as a natural hedge, especially for long-term goals like children\u2019s overseas education. Diversification also means exposure to sectors missing in Indian markets\u2014like global technology giants, luxury brands, or healthcare innovators. Both experts warn against trying to time the market. Instead, they advocate for a steady, strategic allocation to international funds\u2014starting small, around 5% to 10%, and growing it based on your goals. Avasthi highlights that \u201ceven in India, it\u2019s hard to get in and out of the market at the right time. Globally, it\u2019s even harder.\u201d The US and China remain the two most important international markets. While the US continues to offer growth via large-cap tech companies, China provides niche opportunities in energy transition and electric mobility. \u201cA staggered approach to US equity is prudent right now,\u201d Salim said. For China, he sees long-term potential despite near-term uncertainties. Investors must also choose between active and passive strategies. According to Salim, of the 66 international mutual fund schemes currently available, 57% are passive and 43% are active. Passive funds track indices like the S&P 500 or MSCI China, while active funds are managed by professionals and can tap into specific global themes. However, Avasthi cautions against blindly opting for ETFs. Many Indian investors are unaware that ETFs can trade at a significant premium to their actual value. \u201cEven if the market gives zero return and the premium drops, your return can be negative,\u201d he said. In such cases, he suggests choosing actively managed funds of funds (FoFs) instead. \u201cGo via SIPs, use simple active FoFs, and don\u2019t worry about the rest.\u201d Ultimately, both Avasthi and Salim agree on a core-satellite approach: maintain a strong domestic core portfolio, but add global exposure as a satellite component. This, they say, is the best way for Indian investors to build wealth over the long term while managing risks effectively. Watch the accompanying video for more"

According to documents published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the front brake lines in these now-recalled cars \u201cmay be in contact\u201d with their engine air cleaner outlet pipe due to a potential installation defect. That can result in a brake fluid leak and/or a loss of brake function. The recall covers 223,315 Expeditions and 50,474 Navigators between model years 2022 and 2024. Ford expects that just 1% of these vehicles have the defect, per a recall report dated Friday. Ford is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to this recall \u2014 but the Michigan-based auto giant had received 45 warranty reports of front brake line leaks as of April 17, NHSTA documents note. As a remedy, Ford and Lincoln dealers will inspect the front brake line of impacted vehicles and replace it or the air cleaner outlet pipe if necessary, free of charge. Dealer notifications were planned to begin Wednesday, the recall report notes, with owner letters set to be mailed out between May 26 and May 30. In the meantime, drivers can also confirm if their specific vehicle is included in this recall and find more information using the NHTSA site or Ford's recall lookup. The company's number for this recall is 25S47. Impacted drivers may experience an increase in pedal travel, NHSTA documents warn, meaning the pedal would need to be pressed harder to apply the brakes. And if there's a leaking brake line, the fluid level will decrease over time \u2014 potentially causing the red brake warning indicator to light up. A spokesperson for Ford had no additional comments when reached by The Associated Press on Wednesday.

An Indian technical team is in New York and is interacting today with the Monitoring Team of the 1267 Sanctions Committee and other partner countries in the United Nations, official sources said. The team will also be meeting with the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT) and Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED), they said. The team is expected to provide some materials to the relevant UN committees on the alleged involvement of The Resistance Front (TRF) in the strike, it is learnt. The TRF, a front for the UN-proscribed Pakistani terrorist group LeT, had claimed responsibility for the dastardly April 22 attack in which 26 civilians, mostly tourists, were killed in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam. India had vowed to go after terrorists and their backers after the attack. It launched \u2018Operation Sindoor' on May 7, striking terror infrastructure at nine locations in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir."

            "text": "State carrier Qatar Airways signed a deal on Wednesday to purchase jets from US manufacturer Boeing during President Donald Trump's visit to the Gulf Arab country. Trump said the deal was worth $200 billion and included 160 jets. Trump and Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani witnessed the signing ceremony in Doha. The deal was signed during Trump's second stop on a tour of Gulf states after he struck a string of deals with Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg signed the deal with Qatar Airways CEO Badr Mohammed Al-Meer in the presence of Trump and the Qatari emir. According to Trump, Ortberg told him that this is \"the largest order of jets in the history of Boeing, that's good\". Trump added: \"It's over $200 billion but 160 in terms of the jets, that's fantastic. So that's a record, Kelly, and congratulations to Boeing. Get those planes out there, get them out there.\" It's not clear which Boeing aircraft models would be part of the deal and whether the orders from Qatar are firm, which require a deposit and several contractual obligations, or are options. Boeing no longer issues catalogue prices but based on the most recent published value for its most expensive jet, the 777X, a deal for 160 of the long-range aircraft would be worth some $70 billion. Aviation analysts say that airlines typically get large discounts for bulk deals. Boeing was not immediately available for comment. Qatar Airways did not immediately respond to a request for clarification or comment. Also Read: Mike Hesson takes over as Pakistan\u2019s head coach as Aqib Javed undergoes major role change"

Hesson has been a popular figure in modern day cricket, but his acquaintance towards Pakistan and their national team arguably grew whilst spearheading Islamabad United to the PSL title in 2024.

Right afterwards, he assumed multiple responsibilities at the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) right until 2023, taking them to playoffs on more than one occasion.

Nearly a week after his retirement announcement on social media, Rohit met Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis at his official residence, Varsha. Sharing pictures of their meeting, CM Fadnavis wrote, \u201cIt was great to welcome, meet and interact with Indian cricketer Rohit Sharma. I extended my best wishes to him on his retirement from Test cricket and for continued success in the next chapter of his journey!\u201d In a heartfelt Instagram post, Rohit wrote: \u201cHello everyone, I would just like to share that I am retiring from Test cricket.

I will continue to represent India in the ODI format.\u201d It was great to welcome, meet and interact with Indian cricketer Rohit Sharma at my official residence Varsha.

Initially positioned in the middle order, Rohit struggled to cement his place despite flashes of brilliance. The turning point came in October 2019 when he was promoted to open the innings\u2014a move that reshaped his Test career. In his first series as an opener, he smashed a double century and two tons against South Africa, firmly securing his spot at the top. The announcement follows his decision last year to step away from T20Is after leading India to a historic title win at the ICC T20 World Cup. Meanwhile, despite leaving two of the three formats Test and T20Is, BCCI has decided to continue the A+ contracts of Rohit Sharm and Virat Kohli, considering their contribution to the game. \"Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma's grade A+ contract will continue even after both announced retirement from T- 20 and Test Matches. They are still part of Indian cricket, they will get all facilities of Grade A+\", Secretary BCCI, Devajit Saikia told ANI. If the two starlets were demoted from A+ to A category contract, which comes with a Rs 5 crore retainership, then they would have to lose Rs 2 crore annually for each player. Although the BCCI is yet to release an official statement on whether or not Sharma and Kohli's Test retirement will lead to a reassessment of their central contracts, their journey in Test cricket may have ended, but the duo remain central to India's ODI plans. They are expected to play key roles in the upcoming Champions Trophy and future bilateral ODI series."

The initiative is designed to enhance border security, prevent identity theft, and streamline immigration procedures. The implementation of e-passports commenced in April 2024 under the upgraded Passport Seva Programme 2.0. Initial pilots were conducted in key cities including Nagpur, Bhubaneswar, Jammu, Panaji, Shimla, Raipur, Amritsar, Jaipur, Chennai, Hyderabad, Surat, and Ranchi. A complete nationwide rollout is expected by mid-2025, News18 reported. These advanced passports contain a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip, and an antenna embedded in the back cover. The chip securely holds the passport holder\u2019s biometric and personal information, such as facial data, fingerprints, full name, date of birth, and passport number. This data is protected through international encryption standards like Basic Access Control (BAC), Passive Authentication (PA), and Extended Access Control (EAC). Also read | How to renew your Indian passport hassle-free online or offline Now recognised as the global benchmark for secure travel, biometric passports enable contactless verification through e-gates at immigration checkpoints. These systems offer faster, automated border control, reducing queues and eliminating manual document checks. By adopting this technology, India aligns with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards, placing Indian travellers on an equal footing with those from technologically advanced nations and enhancing India's international credibility. Here's all you need to know about the e-passport Domestic production and easy application | The application process is user-friendly and Indian citizens can apply through the Passport Seva Portal, schedule an appointment at a local Passport Seva Kendra or Post Office centre, and complete biometric enrolment in person.

Why the shift matters | In the post-pandemic world \u2014 where international travel surged to over 1.5 billion arrivals in 2023 \u2014 nations are turning to biometric technologies to manage growing volumes securely and efficiently. Moreover, traditional machine-readable passports are vulnerable to counterfeiting and data tampering. Biometric e-passports, combine enhanced protection with physical security, reducing the risk of identity fraud and enhancing the travel experience. What's next: Towards Smart Travel Ecosystems | India\u2019s adoption of e-passports is a first step toward a broader digital transformation in travel. Innovation on the horizon include mobile passport wallets, blockchain-powered identity systems, seamless integration with Aadhaar and DigiLocker, Visas embedded directly into the passport chip. These developments are a firm step towards a future with no paper-based documentation \u2014 one where fully digital, contactless, and intelligent travel becomes the norm. By adopting chip-enabled biometric passports, India has leaped towards redefining international mobility. The leap will boost national security and efficiency and set a foundation for a smarter travel experience for many Indians in the years to come."

The trial was conducted at the Seaward Firing Range in Gopalpur, Odisha. Developed by Solar Defence and Aerospace Limited (SDAL), Bhargavastra is a low-cost system designed to detect and destroy hostile drone swarms. These drone swarms, often referred to as \u201cremote toys\u201d by observers, have become an increasingly serious threat in modern warfare. They have been used extensively in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and were also deployed by Pakistani forces in support of terrorists during Operation Sindoor \u2014 India\u2019s recent counter-terror operations. According to reports, Indian forces responded effectively during that engagement, shooting down all drones launched by Pakistan towards Indian border regions and urban centres. The Bhargavastra trial involved the launch of micro rockets, which, according to officials quoted by the broadcaster, met all predefined performance parameters. The system uses hard-kill technology and is capable of neutralising small or incoming drones at ranges of up to 2.5 kilometres. Three successful tests were carried out in the presence of senior Army Air Defence (AAD) officials. Also read: Swarm Drones are the future of warfare, say Indian defence tech leaders"

            "text": "HomeBusiness NewsStartup NewsAI startup Flam doubles down on global push, backed by $14 million Series A funding led by RTP Global AI infrastructure startup Flam is doubling down on global expansion with a sharp focus on product-led growth and deep partnerships with media and agency networks. The company, which just raised $14 million in its Series A round led by RTP Global, says this approach has already helped it scale to over 100 brands across more than 10 geographies in just 12 months. Flam Co-Founder and CEO Shourya Agarwal said the company is targeting markets across North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. \u201cChannel partnerships and distribution-led growth, along with product-led growth, are helping us move fast. This strategy is working very well for us, not just in India, but internationally as well,\u201d he said. Flam\u2019s platform allows brands to create and publish app-less, mixed reality experiences through simple QR codes or web links. These interactive campaigns can run across print, television, broadcast, retail, and digital platforms. The company says its offering is sector-agnostic, finding adoption in retail, live events, and media broadcasts alike. At the core of Flam\u2019s offering is the blend of technology and creative storytelling. \u201cCreative agencies and brands are very good at what they do. Flam's infrastructure enables that creativity and storytelling in the best possible way because it's so seamless and easy to publish these campaigns,\u201d Agarwal explained. This combination is driving impressive results. According to Agarwal, Flam-powered campaigns are seeing up to 49 times higher engagement and four times better conversions than traditional ad formats. \u201cThe watch time is almost 3x higher than any other ad format today,\u201d he added. High-profile brands like Google, Tanishq, and even the US Presidential Elections have used Flam to power campaigns. IPL recently used Flam\u2019s \u2018Fandom\u2019 feature to allow fans to create custom content with celebrities and cricketers, a move Agarwal said has been \u201cextremely popular.\u201d Flam\u2019s full-stack suite is powered by Gen AI tools and supports instant rendering of heavy 3D content in under 300 milliseconds, even on slower 4 Mbps connections. The content is compressed and streamed in a way that works across 99% of devices without the need for an app or browser. \u201cLiterally, every single phone camera, whether it's a low-end Android device or an iPhone 16 Pro, becomes the point of entry into mixed reality,\u201d said Agarwal. With fresh capital in hand, Flam aims to transform how brands engage with audiences\u2014turning everyday ads, store displays, TV screens, and social media into interactive, immersive experiences.

Launched after a major terror attack, the operation involved targeted airstrikes on terrorist camps and military sites in Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir. Here\u2019s what foreign experts and analysts said about India\u2019s bold new approach: John Spencer | Retired US Army officer and urban warfare expert John W. Spencer called India\u2019s \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019 \u201ca decisive victory in modern warfare.\u201d He pointed out that India has changed its approach\u2014unlike in 2008, when it waited after being attacked, the country now hits back. In a post on X, Spencer said \"After just four days of calibrated military action, it is objectively conclusive: India achieved a massive victory,\u201d adding that Operation Sindoor met and exceeded its strategic aims\u2014destroying terrorist infrastructure, demonstrating military superiority, restoring deterrence, and unveiling a new national security doctrine. \u201cThis was not symbolic force. It was decisive power, clearly applied.\" (Image: johnspenceronline.com) Michael Kugelman | Michael Kugelman, Director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C., described Operation Sindoor as a major step up in India\u2019s response strategy. \u201cOperation Sindoor represents a significant escalation in India\u2019s retaliatory strategy, targeting multiple terrorist sites across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, signaling India\u2019s resolve,\u201d Firstpost quoted Kugelman.

He added that, \"Satellite imagery reveals significant damage to Pakistani military sites, including airbases, confirming the precision and impact of India\u2019s strikes in Operation Sindoor.\u201d Tom Cooper | Austrian military historian and combat aviation expert Tom Cooper described India\u2019s recent strikes on Pakistan as a \u201cclear-cut victory,\u201d noting that Pakistan has struggled to defend itself. \"This is a clear-cut victory. The moment the Indian Air Force started striking nuclear weapon storage facilities in Pakistan, it was absolutely clear that Pakistan is, not entirely defenceless, but largely unable to defend itself from Indian strikes,\" Cooper said in an interview to CNN-News18. He also praised the Indian government for showing restraint by not boasting excessively about the operation. Kris Nair | When India targeted 11 Pakistani Air Force bases on May 10 during Operation Sindoor, it was Kris Nair\u2019s company, Kawa Space, that first released satellite images revealing the extent of the damage. \u201cThese images support India\u2019s claims and highlight the true impact of our operations.

            "text": "HomeTechnology NewsSwarm Drones are the future of warfare, say Indian defence tech leaders Swarm drones will be the future of warfare, said John Livingstone, Founder of Johnnette Technologies, as he reflected on the lessons of Operation Sindoor, India\u2019s large-scale military retaliation against Pakistan\u2019s drone-led offensive. According to Livingstone, India needs to massively scale up its drone inventory and prepare for new-age conflicts where \u201c10 million swarm drones\u201d may be required. \u201cIt\u2019s not just one type of swarm drone; we need multiple types. That\u2019s what we should look to induct in the immediate future,\u201d he said. However, he cautioned that drones should not replace fighter jets but instead complement them. \u201cJust because drones have been proving to be more effective in the past 10 years, we should not abandon fighter jets. Tejas fighter jet makes us stronger, more self-reliant,\u201d Livingstone added, calling for a balanced approach to India\u2019s air power strategy. Ashok Atluri, CMD of Zen Technologies, said the nature of war has undergone a permanent shift. \u201cIt\u2019s like moving from sword fighting to gun fighting,\u201d he said. Atluri stressed that fighter jets like the F-35 are no longer the centrepieces of military power. Instead, drone warfare is defining modern battles, making counter-UAV systems as important as the drones themselves. The push towards drone warfare didn\u2019t happen overnight. Livingstone explained that India had started preparing for this shift after observing how drones shaped outcomes in the Armenia-Azerbaijan and Russia-Ukraine wars. Those conflicts served as a global wake-up call, and Operation Sindoor proved how crucial drone dominance has become. \u201cIndia didn\u2019t even consider using any equipment more than drones. Drones contributed to more than, I think, 60% of the battle,\u201d he said. But drone dominance is only one side of the coin. Atluri underlined the need for a robust anti-drone defence ecosystem to counter threats like the 300 to 400 drones Pakistan sent in a single night. Zen Technologies had started investing in anti-drone systems as early as 2018, when few were thinking about countermeasures. That investment is now paying off, he said. To prepare for long wars, Atluri argued that India must scale up its defence manufacturing to the point where ammunition and equipment can be replenished daily in a multi-front conflict. He urged the government to fund defence companies to build surge capacity. \u201cGlobally, what governments do is say: \u2018You\u2019re only manufacturing at 30% of capacity, but here is the money to build up to 100% capacity. Keep it ready for us.\u2019 I think the Indian government needs to take such visionary steps,\u201d he said. Operation Sindoor showcased the effectiveness of India's indigenous defence technologies, including the Akashteer Air Defence System and suicide drones like Nagastra-1 and SkyStriker. But experts say it also marks the beginning of a new phase in warfare\u2014one where unmanned, AI-driven, and swarm-enabled systems take centre stage. Watch accompanying video for entire discussion."

In a stock exchange filing, the bank said the funds could be raised in one or more tranches via senior unsecured notes under Regulation-S and Rule 144A of the US Securities Act, either through public offerings or private placements. The notes will be denominated in US dollars or any other major foreign currency. The move is part of the bank\u2019s broader capital-raising strategy to support its growth ambitions, meet capital adequacy norms, and provide funding for overseas operations. The decision comes amid increasing global interest rates, a relatively stable rupee, and strong investor appetite for Indian sovereign and quasi-sovereign paper. India\u2019s financial institutions, including SBI, have historically tapped international markets for cost-effective funding, particularly when liquidity conditions are favorable. In January 2023, SBI raised $1 billion through 5-year senior unsecured bonds, which received strong demand from investors across Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. If approved, this new round of fundraising could help SBI shore up its Tier II capital base and support loan growth amid a strong credit demand environment in India. SBI, a majority government-owned entity, is often seen as a proxy for India\u2019s sovereign risk and generally enjoys favorable pricing in overseas bond markets.

In his resignation letter, Anmol Singh Jaggi cited regulatory pressure as the reason for stepping down.

Meera Shankar, former Ambassador to the US, said, \u201cThe substantive aspects of the relationship still stand, both in terms of economic and technological engagement and, to some extent, in terms of strategic convergence in the Indo-Pacific.\u201d She added that while the US had not handled the current situation diplomatically, the broader India-US ties would weather the moment. Satish Chandra, former Deputy National Security Advisor and former Ambassador to Pakistan, echoed this view, noting that the relationship stands \u201con its own trajectory\u201d and has seen consistent progress over successive Indian governments. However, he also voiced clear disappointment over the US response. \u201cOne is a little disappointed with the US actions so far in terms of equating India and Pakistan. I think that\u2019s wrong. If the US wants to stand against terrorism, it should clearly come out against Pakistan,\u201d Chandra said. Despite the ceasefire agreed upon after recent cross-border tensions, India has not altered its firm stance towards Pakistan. Operation Sindoor continues, and there is no resumption of trade or dialogue. \u201cWe have Pakistan on the mat,\u201d said Chandra, adding that any future provocation would invite retribution of a \u201chigher order than what has happened so far.\u201d He stressed that India will judge Pakistan \u201cnot so much by what it says, but by what it does.\u201d Chandra also dismissed President Trump\u2019s repeated claims of having brokered the ceasefire between India and Pakistan. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t Trump who got the two leaders together\u2026 It was the Pakistani DGMO who actually contacted our DGMO,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just a story, not based on any kind of reality.\u201d Shankar underlined that India\u2019s military response, Operation Sindoor, was a calibrated message rather than an escalation. \u201cIt was not intended to destroy Pakistan or its nuclear assets\u2026 What India wanted to convey was that between doing nothing and going in for an all-out conflict, India is going to use that intermediate space to retaliate if there is an act of terrorism against it.\u201d Both envoys criticised the global response that often equates the victim of terrorism with the perpetrator. \u201cInadvertently, what happens in this process of giving priority to de-escalation is that a moral equivalence is drawn\u2026 I think that is unfortunate,\u201d Shankar said. She warned that such responses reward nuclear blackmail and undermine the global fight against terrorism. On international backing, Shankar said countries like France, Russia, and Israel supported India\u2019s right to self-defence. The US showed a mixed response, with its Defence Secretary backing India but the State Department pushing for de-escalation. India has made it clear that the ceasefire was not externally brokered. Prime Minister Modi chaired a Cabinet Committee on Security meeting rejecting claims of US or Chinese intervention. Meanwhile, President Droupadi Murmu was briefed on Operation Sindoor and commended the armed forces for their role. Watch the video for more"

According to the Indian government, loitering munitions were deployed to carry out targeted strikes on Pakistan\u2019s Noor Khan and Rahimyar air bases. The offensive was completed in just 23 minutes without any reported loss of Indian assets. The government added that 10 Indian satellites were used to coordinate the operation and ensure the safety and security of Indian citizens. The operation, officials said, showcased India\u2019s technological edge and growing indigenous capabilities in warfare and surveillance. Operation Sindoor was a precision military strike by India on May 7, 2025, targeting nine terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, in retaliation for the April 22, 2025, Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians. The operation, executed with advanced weaponry like SCALP missiles and HAMMER bombs, aimed to dismantle terror infrastructure while avoiding civilian and Pakistani military targets, demonstrating India's strategic restraint and counter-terrorism resolve."

In the overnight operation on May 6\u20137, India destroyed nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The objectives were clear and, according to analysts, successfully achieved: dismantling terrorist infrastructure, demonstrating military superiority, restoring deterrence, and asserting a new national security doctrine. \u201cThis was not symbolic force. It was decisive power, clearly applied,\u201d said John Spencer, Executive Director of the Urban Warfare Institute. He added, \u201cUnlike previous attacks, this time India didn\u2019t wait. It didn\u2019t appeal for international mediation or issue a diplomatic demarche.

Military dominance: India demonstrated the capability to strike deep into enemy territory, targeting terror hubs, drone centres, and military infrastructure. Restored deterrence: The escalation made clear that India now dictates the terms and tempo of its response. Strategic independence: India managed the crisis on its own, without calling for international mediation. \u201cIndia\u2019s restraint is not weakness\u2014it is maturity.

            "text": "HomeIndia NewsFIITJEE shares sale case: Delhi HC upholds capital gains tax relief, clarifies \u2018one residential house\u2019 rule In a major relief for Lata Goel, wife of FIITJEE promoter D.K. Goel, the Delhi High Court has reaffirmed the findings of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), stating that a taxpayer can avail the benefit under Section 54F of the Income Tax Act by claiming capital gains exemption on the sale of securities that are reinvested in a residential property. The Delhi High Court interpreted that \u2018one residential house\u2019 if divided into floors, will not be considered different properties but should be treated as a single residential house for the purpose of Section 54F. The Delhi High Court allowed Lata Goel\u2019s claim for deduction under Section 54F for Assessment Year 2011\u201312 on gains from the sale of shares of FIITJEE Ltd., on the grounds that the gains were invested in acquiring a new residential house property (new asset). Section 54F of the Income Tax Act offers tax exemption on profits earned from selling any asset other than a residential property, provided certain conditions are met, such as the requirement that the seller reinvest the total sale proceeds into a new residential house. In the present case, during the first round of litigation, a search under Section 132 was conducted on the FIITJEE Group, including the assessee, Lata Goel. The Assessing Officer passed an assessment order under Section 153A read with Section 143(3), restricting the deduction under Section 54F to \u20b930 crore against the claimed amount of \u20b990 crore. Lata Goel challenged the Assessing Officer\u2019s order before the Commissioner of Appeals and the ITAT, both of which ruled in her favour. Subsequently, the Assessing Officer initiated reassessment based on records from the South Delhi Municipal Corporation, which indicated that Lata Goel owned more than one residential property on the date of the transfer of FIITJEE Ltd. shares, and therefore disallowed the entire deduction claimed under Section 54F. The ITAT allowed the appeal in favour of Goel, and the Delhi High Court noted that ownership or partial ownership of different floors would not negate the fact that the portions should be considered as \u2018one residential house\u2019. Referring to a series of judgments, the Delhi High Court stated, \u201c.. We find it difficult to accept that, in the given facts, different floors of a house are required to be considered as multiple residential houses.\u201d Concurring with the ITAT\u2019s decision, the Delhi High Court observed that the assessee, in this case\u2014Lata Goel\u2014could not be denied the deduction under Section 54F on the ground that she held more than one residential unit. The court further observed that the assessee had fairly disclosed the sale of the original asset, in respect of which capital gains had arisen, as well as the purchase of the new house property from the said sale proceeds. The court also held that the configuration of ownership of the property, as recorded in the SDMC records, does not lead to the conclusion that there was any failure on the part of the assessee to disclose material facts. Tax experts welcomed the ruling, stating that the judgment could offer relief in many similar litigations currently underway or likely to arise. Manish Garg, Lead \u2013 Transfer Pricing and Litigation at AKM Global, a tax and consulting firm, stated, \u201cThe Delhi High Court's ruling will provide much-needed clarity to the interpretation of 'one residential house' under Section 54F of the Income-tax Act 1961. By holding that ownership of multiple floors within the same building does not constitute ownership of multiple residential properties, the Court has correctly emphasized the need to look at the actual use of the property rather than just municipal records. This is clear example of appreciating substance over form in income tax law. This judgement is likely to have a significant reference value for other taxpayers as well as the issue of section 54F deduction in case of apartments and builder floors is frequently raised by the tax department.\u201d"

This swift victory was achieved without the costs of a prolonged war like the Russia-Ukraine conflict. India would hope it can now reap the dividends of this success and channel its resources towards peaceful growth. In fact, the pummelling of Pakistan could usher in several years of relative calm, free from major terror disruptions. This could allow India to focus on comprehensive national development. The military victory may have been swift, but its implications are long-term, ushering in a phase of strategic confidence and opportunity. The Indian economy is booming, the stock market is on the rise, and a US-India trade deal is around the corner. Pakistan\u2019s role as a terror state has been exposed through a military engagement, which was also a statement of intent, capability, and future direction. India has avoided falling into any geopolitical trap or getting entangled in drawn-out global proxy dynamics. Pakistan knows that there is now a high cost of sponsoring terror in India.

It virtually rendered Pakistan\u2019s offensive capabilities ineffective. When India struck back, its precision exposed the vulnerability of Pakistan\u2019s defence systems. For the first time in decades, it became evident that Pakistan\u2019s strategic depth was illusory. India proved that Pakistan was no existential threat, but just a nuisance to be dealt with. Before pausing hostilities on Pakistan\u2019s desperate plea, Narendra Modi made it clear\u2014any terror act against India now on will now be treated as an act of war. There will be no difference made between terrorists and their state sponsor, Pakistan. The era of dossier diplomacy, or sending letters to get justice for terror victims, is over\u2014now, India will strike. India is now a major military power with a credible deterrence capability. We have long-range missiles, an efficient air defence network, and a strong leadership spine that gives a free hand to the military. Pakistan\u2019s internal vulnerabilities show that in India, it\u2019s the beginning of a transformative era. Going ahead, Pakistan may well implode while India becomes stronger. The big message India\u2019s success in Operation Sindoor also sends a message to the world that India is not to be trifled with. As PM Modi has said, India is the land of both Buddha and Guru Gobind Singh Ji, who declared, \u201cI will make one warrior fight against 125,000\u2026 I will make sparrows defeat hawks\u2026 only then will I be called Guru Gobind Singh.\" Read more: CDS Anil Chauhan, tri-services chiefs brief President Murmu on Operation Sindoor The PM also said that the success of Operation Sindoor has strengthened the nation\u2019s resolve, unified the country, safeguarded India\u2019s borders, and elevated India\u2019s pride to new heights.

            "text": "HomeSports NewsWhy Indian cricket needs to look beyond Shubman Gill for Test captaincy Indian opener Shubman Gill is considered the frontrunner for the Test captaincy after Rohit Sharma\u2019s retirement from the longest format of the game. The 25-year-old is already Rohit\u2019s deputy in one-day internationals(ODIs), and is reportedly set to leapfrog Jasprit Bumrah and Rishabh Pant into the leadership role in red ball cricket too. With the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) possibly looking at long-term alternatives to spearhead the side, Gill looks poised to take over the mantle heading into the five-match tour of England. However, the decision is arguably not be as straightforward as that. A key reason that made selectors look beyond Rohit was that they did not believe he warranted a place in the XI purely as a player, his seniority notwithstanding. The Mumbai Indians (MI) stalwart aggregated just 31 runs across six innings in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2024-25, before benching himself for the series decider in Sydney. Also read: Who is leading the Indian Test captaincy race for tour of England? Former spinner makes an interesting pick Apply that same metric to Gill, and logic falls flat. He, too, was dropped from the Playing XI just one game prior to the Sydney match, for the Boxing Day encounter in Melbourne in December, in order to accommodate Rohit at the top of the order. In fact, over the last couple of years, there have been multiple instances of his certainty in the starting XI being questioned. Inconsistent numbers despite a long rope There were calls for him to go back to the grind of Ranji Trophy in early 2024, before a century in Vizag against England in February extended his stay. Prior to the Duleep Trophy in September, Gill admitted that he has underperformed in whites, but acknowledged his efforts to improve facets of his gameplay therein. \u201cIn Test cricket, my performance has not matched my expectations so far. But we are going to play 10 Test matches this season, and when I look back after those 10 Tests, hopefully, my expectations will be matched,\u201d he was quoted as saying by PTI. He ended up playing eight of those 10 games, aggregating 401 runs at an average touching 34, with a solitary century to his name despite batting at the key No 3 spot. Gill has a career average of 35 after 32 games, which includes him playing against several key opponents such as South Africa, New Zealand, England, both home and away against Australia, and two World Test Championship (WTC) finals as well. Also read: After Test retirement, when will Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma play next for India? Compare that to the career average of his predecessors at No 3: Cheteshwar Pujara (43.60 after 103 games) or Rahul Dravid (52.31 after 164 games), and it becomes apparent that Gill has a long way to go before his returns improve in Test cricket. His numbers fall further in SENA (South Africa, England, New Zealand, Australia) countries, with the average dropping to 16 and only two half-centuries to boast for. After a fair bit of shuffling around, following the 2023 World Test Championship final, Gill settled into the one-down position, and the results since have been patchy, at best. He scored 93 runs across five innings in Australia last summer, while each of his five centuries in the nearly five years since his debut have come either at home or in Bangladesh. There is no denying his prodigious talent and the promise that could see him become an all-format India mainstay in the coming years, but Gill has some work to do in his batting and the jump to leadership could be premature. \u201cI love watching him play. When you're watching him bat and bat well, he looks as good as anyone in world cricket. But the numbers don't really stack up, do they, away from home?\u201d former Australian skipper Ricky Ponting said on The ICC Review in December 2024. Ponting added, \u201cI watched him a little bit in Adelaide and it almost looked like he changed things up too much. Scott Boland was bowling and he changed his guard, he moved across to the off stump, presented his front pad to Boland, and Boland got him out with a full straight one. If anything, I think he needs to back himself a little bit more, needs to back his defensive technique a little bit more here in Australia and still find a way to be able to score and score quickly.\u201d In pics: The next in line \u2013 5 contenders to replace Rohit Sharma in Tests Gill vs Bumrah vs Rishabh While Bumrah could be the best suited to replace Rohit, concerns over his fitness have been aplenty, with pacer and his former coach Shane Bond even warning that he shouldn\u2019t be playing more than two Tests on the trot at any given point in time. Bond said another back injury could pump the brakes on Bumrah\u2019s career, leaving Rishabh Pant as the only other alternative for captaincy. Pant has been sublime in the longest format, with his numbers stacking right up there with the best amongst the batters in India, despite being a specialist wicket-keeper. After 43 matches, the southpaw averages 42.11 with 15 half-centuries and six tons to his name. He has recorded centuries in England, South Africa, and Australia \u2013 on multiple occasions, which are unprecedented feats for an Indian gloveman, easily positioning himself as the best ever to don the duties for India in the longest format. His strike rate of 73.63 highlights a positive approach, one that goes in sync with the brand of cricket head coach Gautam Gambhir has pushed the team to play, and unlike Gill, his place in the Test side has hardly ever been doubt, even when he returned from a life-threatening car accident. Like other batters, he too endured a tough tour of Australia but made sure that the critics caught a glimpse of his potential with a swashbuckling 61 off 33 in the final innings of the series in Sydney. At 27, he is well settled in the Indian team, having debuted in the format way back in 2018. The England series could be the perfect starting point for him, given the two tons and half-centuries that he has recorded there already \u2013 in merely nine games thus far. And at 27, he still has his best years ahead of him. \u201cWe tend to forget that a batsman\u2019s peak years generally come between 27-34, and Pant is just entering that phase now,\u201d noted analyst Jarrod Kimber said on his YouTube show this month, discussing the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) run with the bat in Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025. Will the selectors look beyond Gill for the all-important responsibility though? The signs suggest otherwise at the moment.

Foxconn, Apple's (top iPhone assembler and Nvidia's AI server maker, has ridden the crest of the wave for artificial intelligence demand, but is also vulnerable to changes in US trade and tariff policy given its large manufacturing footprint in countries like China and Mexico. Chairman Young Liu said on an earnings call that US tariffs will bring more challenges and his outlook for the full year was more cautious than previously, after the company predicted significant growth for 2025 compared with a previous outlook of strong growth. \"Over the past month, rapid changes in US tariff policies have considerably impacted the global supply chain. With recent exchange rate fluctuations adding to the uncertainty, we are taking a more cautious outlook for the near future,\" Liu said. Also read: Cabinet clears HCL Group-Foxconn semiconductor plant in UP While Washington and Beijing on Monday agreed to slash tariffs for at least 90 days, the cheer over the temporary truce was tempered by caution given a more permanent trade deal needs to be struck, while higher tariffs overall could still weigh on the global economy. Most of the iPhones Foxconn makes for Apple are assembled in China. Foxconn is also building a large manufacturing facility in Mexico, another target of US President Donald Trump's tariffs, to produce AI servers for Nvidia. Nvidia said in April it would produce AI servers worth $500 billion in the US over four years, working with companies like TSMC and Foxconn in Houston. In its earnings report, Foxconn said it should see significant on-year growth in the second quarter, with high double-digit growth year-on-year for AI servers and an accelerating volume production ramp-up. The manufacturer does not provide numerical guidance. Also read: Trump administration rescinds curbs on AI chip exports to foreign markets Net profit for January-March jumped an on-year 91% to T$42.12 billion ($1.39 billion), far exceeding the T$37.8 billion average of 13 analyst estimates compiled by LSEG. Foxconn, formally Hon Hai Precision Industry, last month said January-March revenue jumped 24.2% to a record for that quarter on strong sales of AI servers. Foxconn has been looking to expand its footprint in electric vehicles, which it sees as a major future growth generator. Subsidiary Foxtron Vehicle Technologies and Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors last week announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding for the supply of an electric vehicle model. Foxconn has previously said it would consider taking a stake in Nissan for cooperation. Japan's third-biggest automaker is striving to make its business leaner and more resilient after weak sales in China and its biggest market the US. Liu said there was \"of course some progress\" in talks with Japanese carmakers, which he did not name, but that he had nothing to announce. Foxconn's shares have fallen 11.4% so far this year, hit by concerns about U.S. trade policy, compared with a 5.4% decline for the broader Taiwan index.

            "text": "HomeWorld NewsTrump presses Syria leader on Israel ties after lifting sanctions US President Donald Trump asked Syria's new leader on Wednesday, May 14, to normalise relations with Israel after he offered a major boost to the war-ravaged country by announcing the lifting of sanctions. Trump, on a state visit to Riyadh, became the first US president in 25 years to meet a Syrian leader - Ahmed al-Sharaa, an erstwhile Islamist guerrilla and onetime jihadist who had been on a US wanted list and led the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad in December. The interim Syrian president and Trump, wearing matching suits, shook hands as they met jointly with Saudi Arabia's de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and, by video link, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the key supporter of the new government in Damascus. Turkey and Saudi Arabia had both advocated reconciliation with Syria but the move is the latest to put Trump at odds with Israel, which has voiced pessimism over Sharaa and ramped up strikes to degrade the longtime adversary's military capabilities. Read more: Turkey's Erdogan met online with Trump, Syrian and Saudi leaders, Anadolu says The White House said Trump asked the Syrian leader to normalise relations with Israel by joining the so-called Abraham Accords signed by some Gulf Arab states. Trump also asked Sharaa to deport Palestinian militants and tell foreign fighters to leave the country, as well as to take control of camps for captured Islamic State group fighters, currently run by Kurdish militants opposed by Turkey, the White House said. While aboard Air Force One en route to Qatar, Trump poured praise on Sharaa, saying the meeting went \"great\". He is a \"young, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past. Very strong past. Fighter,\" he told reporters. Syria's foreign ministry hailed the meeting as \"historic\", but did not mention the Abraham Accords. State media also did not mention normalisation. The ministry said the leaders discussed \"avenues for Syrian-American partnership in counterterrorism efforts\" and the importance of lifting sanctions and supporting reconstruction. After the longer-than-expected half-hour meeting, Trump said the Assad-era sanctions had been \"really crippling\" on Syria. \"It's not going to be easy anyway, so it gives them a good, strong chance, and it was my honour to do so,\" Trump said, addressing Gulf Arab leaders. Biggest applause The former reality television host, always attuned to crowd sizes, took note of the rapturous reception when he announced the decision at a Riyadh investment forum Tuesday, May 13. \"That was the thing that got the biggest applause from the room. We had a very crowded room with thousands of people,\" Trump said.

The United States imposed sweeping restrictions on financial transactions with Syria during the brutal civil war and made clear it would use sanctions to punish anyone involved in reconstruction so long as Assad remained in power without accountability for atrocities. Trump gave no indication that the United States would remove Syria from its blacklist of state sponsors of terrorism - a designation dating back to 1979 over support to Palestinian militants that severely impedes investment. A senior envoy of the Joe Biden administration met Sharaa in Damascus in December and called for commitments, including on the protection of minorities. In recent weeks, Syria has seen a series of bloody attacks on minority groups, including Alawites - the sect of the largely secular Assad family - and the Druze. Rabha Seif Allam of the Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo said easing US sanctions would help reintegrate Syria with the global economy by allowing bank transfers from investors and from millions of Syrians who fled during the civil war.

            "text": "HomeMarket NewsCommodities NewsThis expert believes silver may be ready for a catch-up rally, recommends tactical allocation via ETFs Silver may be gearing up for a potential rally, supported by its historical relationship with gold, persistent supply deficits, and rising industrial demand, according to Arihant Bardia, Director and Founder of Valtrust. While silver has underperformed compared to gold in recent years, Bardia notes that in previous precious metal bull cycles, silver has historically outpaced gold in terms of returns. \u201cBetween 2000 and 2025, the Gold-Silver ratio has ranged from 32:1 to 125:1, with a 25-year average around 68:1,\u201d he explains. \u201cCurrently, the ratio is close to 100:1, suggesting silver could have room to catch up.\u201d Supply trends and demand drivers One of the key factors underpinning this view is the ongoing supply-demand imbalance. According to Bardia, 2025 marks the fifth consecutive year of silver being in a supply deficit, based on data from the Silver Institute (as of April 2024). At the same time, industrial demand continues to rise, particularly from sectors such as solar energy, electric vehicles, and electronics. \u201cThese drivers, when combined with the wide gap in the gold-silver ratio, point toward a scenario where silver could see a short-term re-rating,\u201d Bardia adds. Price outlook and valuation While gold has recently reached levels around $3,500 per ounce, silver remains under $35. Based on fair value estimates, Bardia suggests silver could move toward a range of $53\u2013$75 in the near term, if supportive conditions persist. In rupee terms, he highlights the potential for silver to rise from around \u20b997 per gram to \u20b9165 per gram, assuming a mean reversion in the gold-silver ratio. This translates to a possible upside of around 70%, though he also cautions that such projections are contingent on broader market stability. Tactical approach recommended Despite the positive outlook, Bardia emphasises that silver should be treated as a tactical allocation, rather than a core portfolio holding. \u201cTactical calls come with higher risk and require well-timed entry and exit,\u201d he says. He advises investors to define their exit strategy in advance\u2014either by targeting returns in the range of 30\u201350% or applying a stop-loss of 10\u201315% to manage downside risk. \u201cThe objective should be to capture the sharp move, not to stay invested for the long term,\u201d he adds. \u201cTactical bets require discipline, and the entry-exit windows are usually tight.\u201d Given silver\u2019s volatility, Bardia suggests limiting exposure to no more than 5% of the overall portfolio. He also recommends using Silver ETFs as the most suitable instrument for taking exposure. \u201cETFs provide flexibility and ease of execution,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can be traded on stock exchanges during market hours and allow even small-ticket investments, making them accessible for retail investors.\u201d"

On Wednesday (May 14), shares of Tata Steel surged as much as 4% following its better-than-expected Q4 FY25 results, prompting several analysts to raise their price targets. The rally helped the company reclaim and retain the fourth spot in market valuation among Tata Group companies. Tata Steel had briefly overtaken Trent Now valued at \u20b91.94 lakh crore, Tata Steel stands \u20b93,300 crore ahead of Trent. While Trent\u2019s shares have plunged nearly 35% since their October 2024 highs, Tata Steel has surged more than 22% in just the past month. Notably, the valuation gap between the two companies was a massive \u20b995,000 crore just seven months ago.

Nuvama upgraded Tata Steel from \u201cHold\u201d to \u201cBuy\u201d with a revised price target of \u20b9177, citing expected improvements in the company's European operations. \u201cWe estimate Q1FY26 EBITDA per tonne to rise by \u20b92,000 quarter-on-quarter, driven by higher prices and lower coal costs, partially offset by softer volumes,\u201d the brokerage noted. Within the Tata Group, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) remains the most valuable company with a market cap of \u20b912.8 lakh crore, accounting for 45.3% of the group\u2019s total valuation of \u20b928.4 lakh crore. Titan and Tata Motors hold the second and third spots, with market capitalisations of \u20b93.2 lakh crore and \u20b92.6 lakh crore, contributing 11.2% and 9.1%, respectively. According to Bloomberg data, out of the 33 analysts covering Tata Steel, 21 rate it a \u201cBuy\u201d, seven recommend a \u201cHold\u201d, and five suggest a \u201cSell.\u201d Also read: ICICI Bank surpasses TCS to become India\u2019s fourth-largest company by net profit in FY25"

Speaking after the EU adopted a 17th sanctions package, Jean-Noel Barrot said that the impact of sanctions had been insufficient so far, and the bloc needed to work with the United States, where Congress has prepared crippling measures should U.S. President Donald Trump decide to pressure Moscow. \"We are adopting today a 17th sanctions (package),\" Barrot told leading news channel BFM TV. \"We will need to go further because the sanctions so far have not dissuaded Vladimir Putin from continuing his war of aggression. So we must prepare to expand devastating sanctions that could suffocate once and for all Russia's economy.\" The 17th package sees some 200 'shadow fleet' tankers sanctioned. Two countries still need to consult their own parliaments on the details but the package is expected to be adopted next week by the bloc's foreign ministers, diplomatic sources said.

In addition to the ships, the package adds new restrictions on 30 companies involved in the trade of dual-use goods while 75 individuals and entities will be listed for their links to Russia's military industrial complex. The countries have also agreed to expand the legal base for their sanctions framework on Russian hybrid threats. One of the new measures will allow the EU to sanction fleets that destroy subsea cables and other physical assets. A further 20 entities and individuals were added to this list. Some European leaders have threatened to impose further sanctions on Russia if Putin does not agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine, but they would face formidable political obstacles and would need U.S. support to succeed, officials and diplomats have said.

That bill would impose tariffs of 500% on countries that imported Russian oil, Barrot said. \"Russia has found ways to circumvent the blockage imposed by Europe and the United States so closing the tap would grab Russia by the throat,\" he said. Diplomats said discussions on a new EU package would take several weeks and aim to target the banking, financial and energy sector, but would face difficulties in securing the necessary unanimity among the bloc's 27 members. Under a human rights framework, the EU also agreed on May 14 to place sanctions on judges and prosecutors involved in the cases against Vladimir Kara-Murza as well as Alexei Navalny, who died in an Arctic penal colony in February last year. The countries have also agreed on an export ban on chemicals used in missile production, the diplomatic sources said.

T\u00fcrkiye and Azerbaijan are often seen as popular destinations for Indian tourists, but the recent data from the travel and hospitality industry reveals a sharp decline in both new bookings and interest in these countries. Travellers are even willing to absorb losses from cancellation charges as geopolitical tensions shape narratives. India's outbound travel market is incredibly lucrative. And the Maldives learned this the hard way after one of their ministers made disparaging remarks about Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The backlash from Indian travellers was swift, leading to a sharp decline in tourism and a significant hit to the country's economy. Now, Indian tourists are once again making their disapproval known by turning away from destinations that are not aligned with India's national interests. A spokesperson from MakeMyTrip, a leading Indian travel platform, confirmed this shift, stating that \"Indian travellers have expressed strong sentiments over the past week, with bookings for Azerbaijan and Turkey dropping by 60%, while cancellations surged by 250% during the same period.\" In response to these sentiments, MakeMyTrip has taken a strong stance: \"In solidarity with our nation and out of deep respect for our armed forces, we strongly support this sentiment and advise against non-essential travel to Azerbaijan and Turkey. We have already discontinued all promotions and offers on our platform to discourage tourism to these two destinations,\u201d the spokesperson told CNBC-TV18. This reaction comes amidst a surge in patriotic sentiment and a call for national unity in the face of geopolitical tensions. While the boycott may be symbolic, its economic impact is expected to be significant, reflecting both consumer choices and national sentiment. Social media platforms have amplified the boycott, with hashtags like #BoycottTurkey and #BoycottAzerbaijan trending. Many users are encouraging their fellow Indians to shift their focus to domestic tourism, urging them to explore lesser-known destinations within India as a gesture of solidarity.

Imports also dropped 17.61% to $1,569.13 million (\u20b913,419.63 crore), the data said. Exports of cut and polished diamonds declined 6.12% to $1,108.74 million (\u20b99,486.88 crore). Weak demand from key markets like the US and China contributed to the decline. A shift towards gold and growing interest in lab-grown diamonds also impacted demand. Imports of cut and polished diamonds fell sharply by 45.95% to $47.64 million (\u20b9407.51 crore), down from $88.13 million (\u20b9735.1 crore) in April 2024. Rough diamond imports, however, saw marginal growth of 0.56%, reaching $1,200.06 million (\u20b910,265.19 crore). The increase reflects ongoing demand for raw stones to support India\u2019s cutting and polishing industry. On the other hand, exports of polished lab-grown diamonds edged up by 0.41% to $110.74 million (\u20b9946.85 crore). These diamonds continue to attract younger consumers looking for sustainable and affordable options. Gold jewellery exports declined by 5.41%, totalling $684.51 million (\u20b95,856.15 crore) in April 2025. While gold remains a global favourite, rising prices have impacted consumer buying trends. Coloured gemstone exports rose 11.95% to $27.76 million (\u20b9237.18 crore), compared to $24.8 million (\u20b9206.91 crore) in April 2024. This niche segment remained resilient amid broader industry headwinds. Commenting on the trends, Colin Shah, MD of Kama Jewelry, said, \u201cThe export decline in April 2025 is a result of Trump-era tariffs and ongoing geopolitical tensions, including the US-China trade war and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. These factors continue to disrupt global trade flows.\u201d He added, \u201cThere is hope for recovery, as recent talks between the US and China could ease tariffs and bring stability to the market in the coming months.\u201d"

May 30 is also the due date for the issuance of TCS certificates for the fourth quarter of FY 2024-25. Sellers who have collected tax at source during this period must issue the Form 27D certificate to buyers. Meanwhile, the ITR filing window for FY 2024-25 is also open. The Income Tax Department has enabled all ITR forms (ITR-1 to ITR-7) for e-filing on its portal. However, salaried individuals may have to wait until mid-June to file their returns. This is because employers typically issue Form 16 around this time. Form 16 is a crucial document for salaried taxpayers. It contains details of salary income and TDS. Without it, filing an accurate return becomes difficult. The e-filing portal is now live, and taxpayers can technically start filing. But experts advise waiting until Form 26AS and the Annual Information Statement (AIS) are fully updated. This ensures fewer errors and faster processing.

            "text": "HomeSports NewsWho is leading the Indian Test captaincy race for tour of England? Former spinner makes an interesting pick Former Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has put his weight behind seasoned pacer Jasprit Bumrah to take over captaincy responsibilities in the Indian Test team, starting from the upcoming five-match-long tour of England. Ashwin, who hung his boots from international cricket in December last year, spoke on his YouTube show about Bumrah being the most experienced asset in the team after the retirements of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, whilst asserting that the speedster deserves the honour of leading the national team in red ball cricket. Ashwin further added that the tour of England will actually mark the beginning of Gautam Gambhir\u2019s era as the Indian head coach, given that a completely new-look side is set to embark on a difficult challenge against the Ben Stokes-led side. Also read | After Test retirement, when will Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma play next for India? \u201cThe team that will tour England will be a completely new team, a transformed team where Bumrah will probably be the senior-most player. He is obviously one of the captaincy options; I think he deserves the captaincy, but the selectors will take a decision based on his physical capacity,\u201d Ashwin said. He added, \u201cTheir retirements will definitely create a leadership vacuum. You can't buy experience, especially on tours like this. Virat's energy and Rohit's composure will be missed.\u201d So far, there have been reports suggesting that Bumrah will not be considered for a leadership role in England given his patchy fitness off late. After injuring his back in Sydney earlier this year, the pacer stayed out of competitive cricketing action for over three months before returning to action in the Indian Premier League (IPL) for Mumbai Indians. Also read | BCCI to retain Grade A+ contract for Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma despite Test retirement He was the vice-captain in the tour Down Under, where India suffered a 3-1 loss. He captained the side to victory in the opening Test in Perth and was the stand-in skipper in the final game in Sydney. However, his troublesome back means that the selectors have to be wary of overexposing him in the longest format. Bumrah\u2019s former coach at MI, Shane Bond, spoke before IPL 2025 that the Indian star\u2019s injury concerns are pretty similar to the one that the Kiwi endured during his playing days. Bond warned that another back injury could mark the end of Bumrah\u2019s career, drawing parallels to that of his own, since he stopped playing at 34. As of now, Shubman Gill is considered to be the frontrunner to take over leadership duties from Rohit Sharma. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) might do a press conference to unveil Gill as the new captain. Rishabh Pant could be his deputy as the team expects a fresh change in the think-tank to begin the new World Test Championship (WTC) 2025-27 cycle. \u201cTests has been the finest [format for India] in the last 10-12 years, but just for the sake of leadership, Rohit should've played till the England series, and if he'd performed, he could've carried on and given some more leadership,\u201d Ashwin added. India\u2019s squad for the England series is likely to be announced in Mumbai on May 23. The India A roster that will tour the country for a couple of unofficial Test matches shall be declared within a few days\u2019 time."

Benchmark Nifty 50 index opened Wednesday's session with a positive bias, gaining 35 points on the back of supportive global cues. The index continued its upward momentum during the first hour of trading. However, profit booking at higher levels led to a sharp intraday decline of over 200 points from the day's peak of 24,767. In the second half of the session, the market saw a strong recovery, regaining more than 150 points from the day's low, and ultimately settled with a gain of 89 points at 24,667. The Indian equity market ended largely in the green, with buying continuing in broader markets. The Nifty Midcap Index rose more than 1%, compared to minor gains for the Nifty. Financials underperformed, with the Nifty Bank index closing in the red. The Nifty Bank index fell 140 points to end at 54,801. Buying continued in defence names, with stocks rising up to 15%. Shares of state-run defence equipment manufacturer Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. rose following its March quarter numbers. REC Ltd. slipped 3% as the company cut its growth guidance for its Assets Under Management (AUM) during its earnings call on Wednesday, May 14. REC now expects its AUM to grow between 11% and 13% from 15% and 17% projected earlier. Mumbai-based drugmaker Cipla Ltd., a Nifty 50 constituent, has warned in its earnings call that its margins for financial year 2026 and 2027 will be lower than current levels as a key drug fully phases out. In response, the stock fell 2%. On the earnings front, quarterly results from LIC Housing Finance, JSW Energy, Cochin Shipyard, Godrej Industries, Patanjali Foods, INOX India, Kaynes Technology, Irm Energy, Balrampur Chini Mills, and ITC Hotels are expected to drive stock-specific action on Thursday's trading session, which will also be the weekly options expiry day. Additionally, stocks like Eicher Motors, Tata Power, Cipla, among others will also be in the spotlight tomorrow, as these companies reported their Q4 numbers after market hours on Wednesday. Both domestic and foreign investors were net buyers in the cash market on Wednesday. Siddhartha Khemka of Motilal Oswal said the positive momentum in Indian markets is likely to persist, supported by easing geopolitical tensions, progress on trade agreements, and improving signs of macroeconomic stability. The bullish trend is well intact for Nifty as it has been holding its level above all key moving averages, said Nandish Shah of HDFC Securities. \"On the downside, strong supports for Nifty are placed at 24,500 and 24,378, while on the upsides 24,850 and 24,975 could offer resistance.\" According to Rupak De of LKP Securities, the Nifty traded within a narrow range today, following two days of high volatile moves. The short-term trend remains positive, as the index continues to remain above critical moving average. After a sharp rally, this sideways movement appears to be a healthy consolidation, suggesting the market is catching its breath before the next move. The analyst said that as long as the Nifty stays above the crucial support level of 24,400, the bulls are likely to maintain their grip. In the near term, the index might move towards the 24,850\u201325,000 range. However, a drop below 24,400 could delay this upward trajectory and lead to further consolidation.

He marked down his economic growth forecast for this year, but said he still expects the economy to continue to expand. \u201cIf the increases in tariffs announced so far are sustained, they are likely to interrupt progress on disinflation and generate at least a temporary rise in inflation,\u201d Jefferson said Wednesday in prepared remarks for a conference organized by the New York Fed."

            "text": "HomeIndia NewsCAIT urges nationwide travel boycott of Turkey and Azerbaijan over Pakistan support The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), representing Indian traders nationwide, has urged citizens to boycott travel to Turkey and Azerbaijan due to their support for Pakistan amid current hostilities. The organisation plans to intensify its efforts by coordinating with travel operators and other stakeholders. Meanwhile, a final decision on suspending trade with Turkey and Azerbaijan will be made at a national conference of leading trade representatives, scheduled for May 16 in New Delhi. CAIT\u2019s Secretary General and Member of Parliament, Praveen Khandelwal, emphasised the economic impact a travel boycott could have on these nations, particularly in their tourism sectors. Citing 2024 data, he highlighted that Turkey received 62.2 million foreign tourists, including approximately 300,000 Indians\u2014an increase of 20.7% over 2023. With a total tourism revenue of $61.1 billion, Indian tourists alone contributed an estimated $291.6 million, spending an average of $972 per person. If Indian tourists stop travelling to Turkey, the nation could face a direct revenue loss of nearly $291.6 million, exacerbated by cancelled weddings, corporate events, and cultural programs. Regarding Azerbaijan, Khandelwal noted that in 2024, the country welcomed about 2.6 million foreign visitors, 250,000 of whom were Indians. With an average spending of 2,170 AZN (approximately $1,276), Indian tourists contributed around $308.6 million. A large-scale decline in tourism from India could slow down the leisure, entertainment, and adventure sectors in Azerbaijan. The economic pressure from such a boycott, he said, might compel Turkey and Azerbaijan to reconsider their stance toward India. Reduced travel would also impact local businesses like hotels, restaurants, and tour operators in these countries. India's merchandise trade with Azerbaijan and Turkey Amid calls for boycotting Turkish goods, data reveals trade with Turkiye has declined to 63% from FY22-23 levels. Amidst boycott calls across social media for trade and tourism with Turkiye and Azerbaijan, trade data from the DGCIS (Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics) has revealed that India's bilateral trade with both these countries has significantly declined in the past two financial years. The rising tensions between India and Turkey have fueled widespread online outrage, following Turkey\u2019s criticism of India\u2019s military strikes on terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). On May 7, the Turkish foreign minister issued a warning, suggesting India\u2019s actions could escalate into a wider conflict\u2014a statement that quickly drew backlash from Indian citizens and officials alike. The controversy deepened when Indian authorities confirmed that drones shot down near the border were of Turkish origin. Allegedly deployed from Pakistani territory, these drones raised suspicions of Turkish support for Pakistan\u2019s military operations. In response to these developments, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has reinforced demands for a firm travel and economic boycott, pushing for decisive action against Turkey and Azerbaijan.

Tata Motors market share Balaji described last year as \u201cmuted\u201d and called it a \u201cyear of consolidation\u201d on the passenger vehicle front. He pointed out that Tata Motors retained a 13.2% market share, often ranking second in the market. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a market share loss issue. It\u2019s more about how we grow market share from here on,\u201d he said, adding that a fresh product launch cycle and improvements in service network capacity should drive growth going forward. The company is gearing up with a strong product pipeline in the passenger vehicle segment. \u201cWe now have an intensive product launch pipeline starting, and we have more or less fixed the service capacity issues,\u201d Balaji said. Both factors, he added, should boost customer sentiment and help the company grow faster than the market. Tata Motors EV market share On the electric vehicle (EV) front, where Tata Motors commands a 55% market share, Balaji dismissed the need for a strategic rethink despite increasing competition. \u201cWe just need to execute with speed,\u201d he said. The company\u2019s near-term EV focus is on expanding penetration rather than protecting market share, especially in the wake of challenges in the fleet segment after the withdrawal of FAME subsidies. Tata Motors plans to cater to a broader EV customer base with what Balaji called the \u201cwidest range in the market,\u201d from the affordable Tiago EV to the upcoming Harrier EV. \u201cThis kind of wide portfolio with multiple range offerings helps us cater to different customer segments effectively,\u201d he said."

            "text": "HomeBusiness NewsCompanies NewsAurionpro sees strong order pipeline, targets 30% revenue growth in FY26 Aurionpro Solutions expects to sustain its strong growth momentum in FY26, backed by a healthy deal pipeline. The company is targeting over 30% year-on-year growth in revenue for the fiscal. In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Global CEO Ashish Rai said with the continued investments in product development and market expansion, particularly into Europe and Southeast Asia, Aurionpro expects to maintain its growth pace in FY26. The company ended FY25 with a revenue of \u20b91,170 crore, comfortably within the guided range of \u20b91,150\u20131,200 crore. The order book is currently at over \u20b91,400 crore, most of which is expected to be executed within the next four to six quarters. These are the edited excerpts of the interview. Q: Your Q4 net profit and revenue surged over 30%, though margins came under slight pressure. You've clocked a 32% revenue growth for the full year. In our last conversation, you said you were hopeful of pushing the top line for the full year to about \u20b91,150 crore to \u20b91,200 crore. Has the year and the quarter turned out in line with expectations? And for FY26, what can you guide for? Can we sustain 30% growth? A: It's been a great year for us. We said we\u2019ll come in between \u20b91,150 crore and \u20b91,200 crore. We came in at \u20b91,170 crore. The business has now grown at 30% plus for four years in a row. We feel good about the demand environment and that both segments of the business have grown at a good clip. Banking grew consistently through the year. TIG had a slow start, but we picked up the pace going into the second half, and it came in at a good number. The margins have been good. At the pace at which we\u2019re investing, of course, margin will go up and down, a point or two here and there. There\u2019s also been fairly strong conversion of EBITDA into cash. Going into FY26, we've stayed on a trajectory for the last four years since we pivoted the business into building out the global products and platforms play. We\u2019ll stick to the growth trajectory and continue to grow at about the same pace. Q: But there were also a few acquisitions that you concluded, small tuck-ins. Can you tell us what the organic growth was last year? A: All of it is organic growth. I don\u2019t think there is any material number coming in from the acquisitions. We don\u2019t really acquire for revenue. If you were to attach a percent to it, I would say it\u2019s probably 1% or thereabouts\u2014or maybe slightly less\u2014coming in from the acquisitions. Why we acquire is mostly for the IP and the quality of the team, and it fit with our longer-term strategic blueprint, not so much for revenue. Q: Most large IT companies this quarter mentioned that clients have turned cautious. They\u2019re in a wait-and-watch mode. It\u2019s still early days, just a couple of days since the US-China tariff easing, but what have you been hearing from clients on the ground? We\u2019re already 45 days into the first quarter of FY26. What\u2019s the feedback? A: We are not really that much affected by what goes on in the US. First of all, 90% of our business is in Asia: India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa. And the demand environment has been fairly strong. The second part of it is that we are in spaces where you\u2019re going through a bit of a demand supercycle, almost. On the banking side, we see the move away from custom software, which is very legacy, into buying out mature enterprise software that brings in best practices in the spaces we are in\u2014transaction banking, lending. We've never seen a demand environment so strong. Similarly, on the transit side, the movement from closed loop to open loop is massive globally. So again, a very strong demand cycle. So overall, from a demand environment perspective, the pipeline and win rates are strong. We\u2019ve built out products that have proven to be very competitive. So, we\u2019ll keep accelerating at the pace we\u2019ve been on for the last few years. Q: Margins in FY25 were 20.6% versus 22% in FY24. So there was a margin compression of 140 basis points. Looking back, what are the three key reasons for this? And what can you guide on margins going ahead? A: We are growing or investing at a very fast pace. And most of our investments are actually expenses, because we don\u2019t capitalise much. Most of that buildout, expanding into newer geographies like Europe, is a huge bet for us this year. We\u2019ve been investing close to \u20b960-70 crore in that. We\u2019ll operate within a 2% band. 20% is about the level we feel comfortable with. Q: In terms of numbers, will there be a downward bias? FY26 margins should be closer to 20%\u2014not the 20\u201322% margin band you operated in last year? A: Yeah, I think so. There may be some pressure for a couple of quarters as we expand into Europe, which was very close to zero last year. This year, we expect it to climb up to at least 7\u20138% of revenue. That means a significant investment in building out a sales team and products. In terms of growth, we should be able to grow at 30% plus on both revenue and earnings. Q: At the end of the third quarter, your order book was around \u20b91,300 crore. What is the kind of pipeline that you're looking at? A: The order book now stands at about more than \u20b91,400 crore. We don't really declare multi-year orders. Most of the order book for us is executable over the next four to six quarters. Every quarter we consume from the same order book and add to it. The incremental \u20b9110-odd crore addition is a pretty significant thing in a quarter. Most of it will get consumed in FY26 and that gives us a lot of confidence in terms of the demand outlook for FY26. Pipeline is at least 60% larger than when we entered FY25. The demand pipeline is something we've not seen before. Part of the reason is the transformation spend on the banking side, which has really gone up, especially with demands around AI and almost all the banks want to catch up on the technology stack. Also, now we are in a lot more newer markets. So we've gone into Europe. Middle East is a lot stronger. Southeast Asia a lot stronger."

            "text": "HomeMarket NewsCryptocurrency NewsCoinDCX expands Middle East and North Africa ops with BitOasis launch in Bahrain CoinDCX has launched BitOasis operations in Bahrain as part of its plans to expand across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The move follows CoinDCX\u2019s acquisition of BitOasis in 2024 and is part of a wider strategy to increase international revenue. BitOasis will operate in Bahrain under a Crypto-Asset Services Licence issued by the Central Bank of Bahrain. CoinDCX expects more than 30% of its total revenue to come from the MENA region by 2026, up from the current 20%. Sumit Gupta, Co-Founder of CoinDCX, said the company's expansion in the region is influenced by regulatory clarity, growing investor interest, and the size of high-net-worth individual investment flows. According to Gupta, BitOasis has seen fourfold revenue growth since the acquisition. The Bahrain platform will offer services to retail, corporate, and institutional clients. New features include premium services for high-net-worth individuals and support for local bank transfers across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). BitOasis Co-Founder and CEO Ola Doudin said the Bahrain launch represents a continuation of the company\u2019s regional growth plans. CoinDCX\u2019s technology team now manages the backend infrastructure of the platform. The move comes amid increased activity in the MENA virtual assets sector, supported by regulatory initiatives and investment in blockchain infrastructure across the region. The market is also shaped by a young population and high levels of internet penetration. According to data from IMARC Consulting, the GCC crypto market was valued at $744.3 million in 2024 and is projected to reach $3.5 billion by 2033, with an annual growth rate of 16.75%. Around 38% of crypto users in the region have annual incomes above $15,000. BitOasis has processed more than $7.4 billion in trading volume since its founding in 2016 and has raised over $40 million in funding. The Bahrain launch follows the platform securing a Virtual Asset Service Provider licence from Dubai\u2019s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority in December 2024."

The judge on Tuesday (May 13) ordered DDG, whose legal name is Darryl Dwayne Granberry Jr., to stay away from Bailey and their 17-month-old son, Halo, until a June 6 hearing. \u201cThroughout our relationship,\u201d Bailey said in documents requesting the order, \u201cDaryl has been and continues to be physically, verbally, emotionally, and financially abusive towards me. I am seeking orders to protect myself and our son Halo from his ongoing abuse.\u201d A message seeking comment from a representative for Granberry was not immediately answered. Bailey, 25, and Granberry, 27, were in a relationship from 2022 until last year, and since their breakup there have been \u201cmultiple acts of physical violence,\u201d Bailey said.

At one point, Darryl was pulling my hair. He then slammed my face on the steering wheel, causing my tooth to get chipped. I then stopped fighting back as I was in a lot of pain.\u201d Bailey included photos of her tooth and bruises on her arms in her filing. In March, she said Granberry entered her house when she wasn\u2019t home and texted her a photo of her bed along with a threatening message suggesting she was having sex with other men. A few days later, she said, he berated her when she did not want to send their sick baby on a visit with him, and smashed the Ring camera on her porch when he realised it was recording the confrontation. She said when she called a relative for help, he took her phone and got into his car, slamming the door on her as she was holding the baby. Bailey filed a police report over the incident.

As a result, I then receive threats and hate on social media.\u201d Granberry was also ordered not to possess any weapons. The judge can extend the order for up to five years at the June 6 hearing. DDG, from Pontiac, Michigan, first saw success as a video streamer and then as a hip-hop artist. On May 5, he released his fourth studio album, \u201cBlame the Chat,\u201d on Epic records. Bailey, from Atlanta, has been nominated for five Grammy Awards as both a solo artist and as part of Chloe x Halle, the duo with her sister that first brought her fame. She starred in the sitcom \u201cGrown-ish\u201d from 2018 to 2022, and in 2023 played the title character in Disney\u2019s live-action remake of \u201cThe Little Mermaid.\u201d"

Now, all eyes are finally turning to Istanbul to seek an end to Russia\u2019s 3-year-old, full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed restarting direct peace talks with Ukraine in the Turkish city that straddles Asia and Europe. And President Volodymyr Zelensky challenged the Kremlin leader to meet in Turkey in person. What will unfold remains unclear. The Kremlin has refused to confirm who\u2019s going to Turkey and whether it will include Putin. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Zelensky will only sit down with the Russian leader. Zelensky said Tuesday (May 13) that \u201cif Putin does not arrive and plays games, it is the final point that he does not want to end the war.\u201d What\u2019s known about the possible talks: On Saturday (May 10), Zelensky hosted French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk in a show of unity. They issued a coordinated call for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine starting Monday (May 12).

The leaders pledged tougher sanctions on Russia if Putin did not accept the proposal. In remarks to the media early Sunday (May 11), however, Putin effectively rejected the offer and proposed restarting direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul instead \u201cwithout preconditions.\u201d He did not specify whether he envisioned the talks to involve Zelensky and himself personally, or with lower-level officials. Zelensky responded by insisting on a ceasefire, saying he will travel to Turkey \u2014 and challenged Putin to do the same: \u201cI will be waiting for Putin in (Turkey) on Thursday (May 15). Personally. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses.\u201d Pressed by reporters on who will represent Russia in Istanbul, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to say, stressing that Putin had outlined Russia\u2019s position clearly enough. Trump\u2019s administration initiated separate talks with Russia and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia in March. But since then, the administration has indicated it might withdraw from the process if no tangible progress is made. Trump said on Monday (May 12) he was optimistic about the talks \u2014 a sharp contrast to a contentious Oval Office meeting with Zelensky on Feb. 28. Read more: Putin proposes direct peace talks with Ukraine after three years of war There is \u201cthe potential for a good meeting\u201d between Putin and Zelensky, Trump said in Washington. He added he was \u201cthinking about flying over\u201d after his visit to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates but later said Secretary of State Marco Rubio and others from the U.S. will go to Turkey for the talks. Podolyak on Tuesday (May 13) told a YouTube broadcast by prominent Russian journalists in exile that the Ukrainian leader won\u2019t be meeting any Russian officials in Istanbul other than Putin. He added that \u201cthere are always people\u201d in Zelensky\u2019s entourage who can \u201cconduct certain negotiations at corresponding levels\u201d with the Russians but questioned the point of a lower-level meeting. \u201cUndoubtedly, only Putin can make the decision to continue the war or stop the war,\u201d he said. Zelensky said Tuesday (May 13) he will meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the capital Ankara, and wait there. If the Russian leader chooses Istanbul for the meeting, Zelensky said, then he and Erdogan will travel there. If Putin doesn\u2019t show, European and U.S. leaders should follow through with additional sanctions against Russia, he added. The Kremlin billed Thursday\u2019s (May 15) talks as a \u201crestarting\u201d of peace negotiations in Istanbul in 2022, early on in the war, that quickly fell apart. Moscow had blamed Ukraine and the West for their alleged desire to continue fighting, while Kyiv said Russia\u2019s demands amounted to an ultimatum rather than something the sides could mutually agree on. Read more: Zelenskyy ready to meet Putin in Turkey; hopes for ceasefire with Russia ahead of planned talks Zelensky has said the Russian delegation\u2019s demands included Ukraine\u2019s recognition of Russian control over the Donbas, an area in eastern Ukraine consisting of Donetsk and Luhansk regions; constitutional amendments to declare neutrality; a significant reduction of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces; and the surrender of long-range weaponry. \u201cThere were never any negotiations; it was an ultimatum from a murderer,\u201d he said in 2022. Putin accused Ukraine of derailing a peace deal that was basically agreed on and included clauses of Ukraine\u2019s neutral and nonnuclear status and details on how much its army would be reduced. \"The Kyiv authorities \u2026 just threw it all away. They turned it down,\u201d Putin said in 2023. The Kremlin has said repeatedly \u201cthe Istanbul agreements\u201d could serve as a basis for further peace talks. After Moscow illegally annexed the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in September 2022, Russian authorities started saying that Kyiv should also recognize \u201cthe reality on the ground.\u201d Putin last year demanded that Ukraine cede the four regions, which it still does not fully control. He also wants Kyiv to recognise the Crimean Peninsula, also illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014, as Russian; Ukraine also must renounce its bid to join NATO and drastically reduce its army. He also demanded that the West lift sanctions imposed on Moscow after the invasion. Kyiv, in turn, refused to cede any land and wants robust security guarantees against future Russian aggression. Trump, who has engaged in a broad diplomatic effort to end the war since taking office, has said that Crimea, \u201cwill stay with Russia.\u201d He has also said that Kyiv was unlikely to ever join NATO.

The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said Russia is \u201cquickly replenishing front-line units with new recruits to maintain the battlefield initiative.\u201d In 2024 and more recently, Russian troops have made slow but steady gains in several sections along the front. Putin said in March that Russian troops have \u201cgained steam\u201d and \u201care holding strategic initiative all along the line of contact.\u201d Zelensky warned that Russia was delaying talks in preparation for bigger offensives. Last month, Moscow\u2019s forces also declared that they fully reclaimed chunks of Russia\u2019s Kursk region bordering Ukraine that Kyiv\u2019s forces seized in a surprise incursion in August 2024. Kyiv denied the claim, but it has been steadily losing ground there as Moscow, aided by North Korean soldiers, worked to push them out and leave Ukraine without a key negotiating chip. Several attempts to establish at least a partial ceasefire have been unsuccessful. Russia effectively rejected a 30-day unconditional truce; the Kremlin instead declared two short, unilateral ceasefires for holidays in the last two months - one for 30 hours at Easter and another for 72 hours to coincide with Russia\u2019s World War II Victory Day celebrations. In both cases, Kyiv and Moscow accused each other of failing to halt the fighting. Russia and Ukraine also pledged in March to observe a 30-day halt to attacking energy infrastructure that was brokered by the Trump administration. Both sides repeatedly accused each other of massive violations until the measure expired. RussiaRussia Ukraine TensionsRussia-Ukraine warTurkeyUkraineunited states"

            "text": "HomeSports NewsAfter Test retirement, when will Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma play next for India? The previous week has been an eventful one for Indian cricket, as seasoned stars Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli called it a day from their Test careers. The duo had already quit playing T20Is after the World Cup final in Barbados last year, which means that two of the team\u2019s most experienced stalwarts will now represent the nation only in ODIs. Rohit has clearly stated his desire to keep playing till the ODI World Cup in 2027 during a recent interview with journalist Vimal Kumar, whereas Virat, too, is expected to follow suit since it is his strongest format where he averages 57.9 after 302 games. Rohit and Virat will be aged 40 and 38 respectively by the time of the next ODI multi-nation event, and it could arguably be a tall ask for them to sustain their fitness and form levels. A major predicament on this front is the fact that countries across the cricketing world have gradually reduced the number of ODIs that they engage in, partly due to the increased focus laid on T20Is and the latter\u2019s greater marketability too. Also read | BCCI to retain Grade A+ contract for Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma despite Test retirement Which is why, the traditional norm of five-match ODI series\u2019 have been done away with since 2019 onwards, with most of bilateral contests in the 50-overs format lasting for a maximum of three games now. Often, three-match ODI engagements are preceded or succeeded by a five-game-long T20I one, suggesting the evolving nature of international white-ball cricket. On that note, it will be a major hit for Indian cricket that Rohit and Virat won\u2019t be seen in action next till August, as they will cease to be a part of the Test squad that will engage in a marquee five-encounter series in England starting on June 20. India\u2019s next ODI series is scheduled to be held in Bangladesh, starting August 17 in Dhaka. However, there are doubts over whether that tour will take place amid the on-going tensions between the two countries. There is a possibility of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) organising another series to make up for that, but if the schedule is really done away with, then Virat and Rohit will return to play for India only in October during the ODIs in Australia. Following that, there will be another set of three 50-overs matches against South Africa at home in November-December. Also read | In pics: The next in line \u2013 5 contenders to replace Rohit Sharma in Tests However, going by the current set of fixtures, the duo will be representing India in only nine matches by the end of this year. For two players who had become almost synonymous with Indian cricket, and had propelled to become all-format regulars, it shall be a huge jolt to deal with at both an individual level and also collectively for the team. Another interesting notion to look forward to would be their ability to get back into the groove almost immediately after long-drawn breaks, as a three-match ODI series gives little time to recover form. Regardless to say, interesting times rest ahead for Indian cricket and two of its most beloved stars."

Once operational, the plant is projected to cater to 40% of India\u2019s demand for display driver chips. Foxconn may also use the facility to manufacture chips for its global operations outside China, expanding its supply base under the \u201cRest of World\u201d strategy, Vaishnaw added. A Growing Chip Ecosystem Since the inception of ISM, India has been actively courting global players and investing in domestic capabilities across fabrication plants, outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) units, and advanced packaging. The HCL-Foxconn partnership is part of a larger push that includes several high-profile projects: Also read: Budget 2025 | Semiconductor outlay increases by 83%, mobile phone PLI gets a 55% boost States Compete for Semiconductor Projects Several states are aligning with the central government to attract semiconductor investments through subsidies, land allocations, and infrastructure support. National Push for Self-Reliance The India Semiconductor Mission is offering up to 50% fiscal support for eligible projects and has launched a design-linked incentive (DLI) scheme to support chip design startups and R&D efforts. Combined with state-level incentives of up to 25%, the financial ecosystem for chipmaking in India has never been more favourable. The government\u2019s focus extends beyond manufacturing to include workforce training, with skill centres planned in several states, and R&D collaborations such as Tata Electronics\u2019 partnership with Tokyo Electron. What Lies Ahead India\u2019s semiconductor market is projected to reach $64 billion by 2026. Current and planned projects are expected to generate more than 1.2 million jobs and position the country as a critical player in the global supply chain.

            "text": "At a time when the nation is celebrating Col Sofia Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh for their fearless service and sharp, confident press briefing that rattled Pakistan's military establishment, Madhya Pradesh BJP leader and state Tribal Affairs Minister Vijay Shah has sparked outrage with his derogatory comment targetting Col Qureshi. Shah, often in the news for all the wrong reasons, made the remark at a public gathering in Madhya Pradesh. The statement is yet another addition to his long list of offensive remarks against women. Col Qureshi, who along with Wing Commander Singh became the face of Operation Sindoor, was the latest target of Shah's verbal tirade. The Jabalpur court has taken suo motu cognisance of Shah's remarks on Col. Quershi. The court has directed the police to file an FIR against Shah under stringent sections. Following his latest comment on Col Qureshi, Shah attempted damage control by telling journalists he was willing to apologise. He claimed he would never disrespect a soldier since he belongs to a family of martyrs and servicemen. However, a fact-check by News18 India revealed that no one from Shah\u2019s family has served in the armed forces. The BJP and RSS have since reprimanded Shah for his statement. He was pulled up by state BJP president VD Sharma and state general secretary Hitanand Sharma. Party sources suggested Shah may once again be removed from his cabinet position. The Congress has taken a strong stand against Shah's comment. Several leaders have changed their display pictures on social media to Col Qureshi's photo in a show of solidarity. Protests are being planned across Harda and Madhya Pradesh. Senior Congress leader and former chief minister Digvijaya Singh condemned Shah's remarks, stating, \"The entire nation is proud of Col Sofiya and is applauding her for the way she represented the Indian Army during Operation Sindoor. But politicians like Vijay Shah are making such statements because they believe it brings them attention and promotion within their party. This is not the first time he has made a derogatory, divisive, and objectionable comment. I urge the BJP leadership to take strong action against him.\" Shah, who hails from the Harda region and claims to belong to a royal tribal family, is facing fierce backlash across the country, particularly from citizens in Madhya Pradesh, his own constituency and Harda. Various citizen groups in Harda have called for his sacking and urged all political parties to deny him future tickets. This isn't the first time that Shah has stirred controversy. In 2013, while serving as a minister in the Madhya Pradesh cabinet, he made a derogatory statement about Sadhana Singh Chauhan, wife of then Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Though reprimanded and removed from his post at the time, Shah was fielded by the BJP in subsequent elections, securing tickets in both 2018 and 2023 state polls. A sitting eight-time MLA, Shah's political career appears unaffected by his repeated misconduct. Shah has also made several objectionable remarks about Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi over the years. With inputs from Manoj Sharma, News18"

Before the selectors could announce the squad and captain for the upcoming tour of England, Kohli and Sharma brought down the curtains on red ball cricket. The retirement from Test cricket follows their earlier exit from the T20 (international) format, which they had confirmed after India lifted the 2024 T20 Cricket World Cup. Nonetheless, despite leaving two of the three formats, BCCI decided to continue their A+ contracts, considering their contribution to the game. Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma's grade A+ contract will continue even after both announced retirement from T- 20 and Test Matches. They are still part of Indian cricket, they will get all facilities of Grade A+: Secretary BCCI, Devajit Saikia to ANI \"Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma's grade A+ contract will continue even after both announced retirement from T- 20 and Test Matches. They are still part of Indian cricket, they will get all facilities of Grade A+\", Secretary BCCI, Devajit Saikia told ANI. If the two starlets were demoted from A+ to A category contract, which comes with a Rs 5 crore retainership, then they would have to lose Rs 2 crore annually for each player. Also read | In pics: The next in line \u2013 5 contenders to replace Rohit Sharma in Tests The BCCI is yet to release an official statement on whether or not Sharma and Kohli's Test retirement will lead to a reassessment of their central contracts. Although their journey in Test cricket may have ended, Rohit and Kohli remain central to India's ODI plans. They are expected to play key roles in the upcoming Champions Trophy and future bilateral ODI series. Meanwhile, England pace great James Anderson recently said that India's next generation of batters have the aggression and fearlessness to step into the \"big shoes\" of Kohli and Sharma in the Test team. Kohli and Sharma, legends of Indian batting, bid farewell to Test cricket within a week of each otherand will only feature in ODIs for India in future. Kohli ended his inspiring run in the traditional format, scoring 9230 runs from 123 matches with 30 hundreds at an average of 46.85, while Rohit accumulated 4301 runs from 67 Tests at an average of 40.57 and has 12 centuries and 18 fifties to his name. \"Great players. Kohli, one of the greatest Test batters that's ever been,\" Anderson said on 'talkSPORT'. The twin retirements mean India will not only have a new captain at the helm but will be without two of their most experienced players. \"There will be a new captain because Sharma has retired, There's big shoes to fill there but they've got a huge amount of talent in their squad,\" Anderson added. He praised the new crop of Indian batters for their attacking mindset, while concluding. (With inputs from PTI)"

Motilal Oswal Financial Services attributed the growth to gains in liquid and equity funds, boosted by market momentum. Despite the AUM high, equity inflows fell for the fourth month in a row.

Partners, eligible for tax benefits, must invest at least \u20b910 crore over 10 years or \u20b920 crore over 20 years. The project will begin with 25 ITIs and expand to 100 based on pilot outcomes.

The funds, part of the second instalment under the 37-month programme, will be reflected in SBP\u2019s foreign exchange reserves for the week ending May 16, according to a Reuters report on Wednesday. The disbursement follows the IMF Executive Board\u2019s review meeting on May 9, during which it also approved Pakistan\u2019s request for an additional US$1.4 billion under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF). The RSF aims to support climate-related reforms and strengthen disaster preparedness. total IMF disbursements to Pakistan under the EFF now stand at US$2.1 billion, out of the approved US$7 billion package, which began on September 25 2024. However, India abstained from voting at the IMF board meeting, voicing strong reservations about Pakistan\u2019s eligibility for further bailouts. India noted that Islamabad remains a long-standing IMF borrower with a history of poor compliance, and warned that the growing scale of financial support has rendered Pakistan a \"too big to fail debtor\" for the Fund. Despite India's concerns, the IMF said Pakistan had shown strong implementation of reforms, pointing to a primary fiscal surplus of 2.0% of GDP in H1 FY25, headline inflation at just 0.3% in April, and rising foreign exchange reserves, which improved from US$9.4 billion in August 2024 to US$10.3 billion by April-end, with expectations to touch US$13.9 billion by June 2025.

            "text": "HomeIndia NewsSupreme Court calls for performance audit of judges over breaks The Supreme Court on Tuesday (May 13) suggested conducting a performance audit of judges, especially given the frequent complaints concerning the efficiency of High Court judges. According to a Bar and Bench report, a bench of Justice Surya Kant and Justice NK Singh noted that some judges worked diligently, while others took frequent breaks, raising questions about how they utilised their time. The court said it was high time to do a performance audit to assess the expenditure on them vis-\u00e0-vis their output. \"There are some judges who work very hard, but at the same time, there are judges who are unnecessarily taking coffee breaks; this break or that break. What is for lunch hour, etc. We are hearing a lot of complaints about the High Court judges,\" the court said. \u201cThis is a larger issue which needs to be looked into. What is the performance of the High Court judges? How much are we spending, and what is the output? It's high time we do a performance audit,\" it added. The oral observations were made while hearing a plea concerning delays in delivering judgments in the Jharkhand High Court, where four life convicts' appeals were pending for over two to three years. The court previously sought information regarding the status of these matters. On Tuesday, it was reported that decisions in all four instances had been issued. While appeals were accepted in three of the cases, there was a disagreement in the fourth case, therefore, it was referred to another bench. The court was further told that all four petitioners have been released from prison. The Supreme Court on May 5 requested reports from all High Courts with information on instances where a decision has yet to be issued, despite the matter being reserved for a verdict on or before January 31, 2025. On May 9, it requested reports from High Courts on the dates on which judgments were issued and the dates when those were published on court websites. The top court on Tuesday hinted at issuing guidelines to prevent delays in judgments and stated that such matters require a more thorough review to ensure that litigants do not lose faith in the legal system. \"The issues raised on May 5 are of paramount importance, goes to the root of the criminal justice system. It seems that the issues noticed in the above-mentioned orders would require and deeper analysis and mandatory guidelines by this court, so that convicts or undertrials aren't compelled to lose faith in the justice delivery system and to avoid the petitions like one in the present case,\" it said."

Punit Lalbhai, Vice Chairman at Anup Engineering said, \u201cWe have a very strong order book going into the year and this year is no different. We already have about 80% of the order book locked in, and we are now looking at short lead time orders to ensure that our growth will be above 25% and we should be in with that 20% plus EBITDA margin so things are on track for next year.\u201d Anup Engineering's current order book stands at around \u20b9750 crore, scheduled for delivery in FY26. The company is in advanced discussions for several large orders expected to be finalised over the next three to four months. Once secured, these orders are likely to help push topline growth beyond 25%. The business environment has been challenging, particularly in the aftermath of the general elections in India, which led to subdued order enquiries from the PSU sector. Additionally, uncertainty around US elections and tariffs has slowed activity from the American market. However, with domestic projects beginning to gain momentum again, the company is confident that just one or two more key inquiries will be enough to meet its targets for the upcoming financial year. In the January\u2013March quarter of 2025 (Q4FY25), Anup Engineering reported revenue of \u20b9204 crore, an EBITDA margin of 15.96%, and a net profit of \u20b929 crore. Anup Engineering's cash flow from operations has declined sharply\u2014from \u20b9170 crore to a negative \u20b98 crore\u2014primarily due to a \u20b9140 crore rise in trade receivables. This spike is largely attributed to one significant order that has been delayed at the customer's request, as their site is not yet ready. The company expects the situation to normalise by the July\u2013September quarter of FY26 (Q2FY26), once the order is executed and receivables are cleared. Management does not view this as a structural concern. For full interview, watch accompanying video Anup Engineering's current market capitalisation is \u20b96,007 crore.

            "text": "HomeBusiness NewsCompanies NewsASK Automotive aims for mid-teens growth, improved margins, export ramp-up ASK Automotive is targeting mid-teens revenue growth in FY26, supported by expected recovery in the two-wheeler segment, improved macroeconomic factors, and higher export contribution. The company also expects better operating margins in the current financial year, driven by higher capacity utilisation and a planned ramp-up in newer facilities. In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Chairman and Managing Director Kuldip Singh Rathee said ASK Automotive is aiming for a 150 basis point improvement in EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation) margins to 14%. Export revenue, which currently accounts for around 4.5%, is expected to increase with new orders in the pipeline, including a \u20b975 crore order. The company plans a capex of \u20b9450 crore in FY26, largely funded through internal accruals. This is the edited transcript of the interview. Q: A two-part question: one, what's your outlook for FY26 when it comes to revenues and margins? And secondly, you were looking to increase your contribution coming from electric vehicles and exports. Where do those numbers stand right now? What's the prognosis for next year? A: This year, we have done well, as you see that the full-year profit has grown by 43%. About the next year, it also looks very positive. Why I am positive on two-wheelers is that we have still not reached the numbers that we achieved in 2018-19, though we were very close to this. I see a good year ahead, especially in view of all the macroeconomic indicators that is, the low interest rates, the tax cuts which are going to benefit the two-wheeler industry, and the forecast of good monsoons. Next year, we again expect revenue growth to be in the mid-teens. As always, we'll outperform the industry, which we have been doing for the last 30 years. Q: Could you tell us what proportion of your revenue comes from EVs? Earlier, you were aiming to scale up exports as well, but globally things have become uncertain. For FY26, what kind of revenue contribution can you expect from EVs and exports? A: Yes, you're right. The EV sector has not picked up as yet. The EV share of the whole two-wheeler market is less than 5% and it has not even crossed that mark. Our share is also around 4.7% or so. We are moving in line with the share of the EV sector. We are OEM to 80% of the organised EV market, so we'll grow as per the growth of the industry. On the export side, we have done a lot of groundwork. We wish to grow further ahead, but the geopolitical situation has not been good and tariff uncertainties also came in. But we have held the ground. This year, we can see an appreciable improvement in exports, as one of the customers has a new order of \u20b975 crore in the pipeline, which we hope will go as per plans. Q: And what would that take your overall export contribution to this year? A: Right now, we are at around 4.5%, and next year we will definitely, hopefully, improve it. Q: Because exports offer better margins for you? A: Yes. We are at \u20b9147 crore. Our aim is to go to \u20b9250 crore. Q: And what does that do to your margins? A: Margins are always better in exports. Q: Overall margins for the next year. What's your target? A: We will certainly improve our overall margins by 150 basis points. We are aiming to achieve 14% EBITDA margins. Q: Exports will move from around \u20b9147 crore to \u20b9250 crore. Is that correct? A: Yes. Q: Tell us more about the Karoli plant. You were looking to ramp that up. What is the current utilisation level, and how much are you factoring in terms of contribution from there? A: Karoli plant is continuously receiving investments, and capacity utilisation also remains at around 50%. It is already generating cash profits. After that, we made one more investment in the Bengaluru plant, which we commissioned on January 14. All the necessary QA approvals have happened, and we are confident that from this quarter, even that plant will become EBITDA positive. Q: You were expecting the Karoli plant to do revenues of close to \u20b9300 crore at peak. Is that correct? A: No, I said ultimately it will go to more than \u20b91,000 crore. But it will need further investments, which we will be making this year of about \u20b9200 crore more investment. Already, it has achieved \u20b9500 crore. Q: What is your capex plan for this year? A: Since I am an optimist, we\u2019ll be spending about \u20b9450 crore, mostly from the cash generation that we will make. Q: What is the optimist in you telling you about your own stock price? The promoter entity still holds around 79% in the company. You have 4% more to come down to meet the minimum public shareholding norm. A: We have 18 months left for that. We are not in a hurry. We are a very cash-rich company. Q: You were also looking to increase your contribution coming from non-two-wheelers, commercial vehicles and passenger vehicles. Where does that number stand now? Have you won any client orders here? A: Yes, we have got the orders, and that\u2019s through Tier-1 suppliers. We are not directly into the passenger vehicle segment, but we are through Tier-1, and that business is slowly and steadily growing. Q: Where do you expect this to go from here? A: This will keep on increasing, because the focus is there. The idea is to overall grow the business in double digits. Because only then there is more capacity utilisation, you get more economies of scale, and that\u2019s how margin improvement comes in."

The fifth largest equity market has now displaced Japan as most Favored Asian Market. The revival in confidence is interesting considering the country had slipped to the second-least favoured stock market in Asia in February this year. A net 42% of fund managers surveyed by Bank of America (BofA) preferred India over other regional markets, placing it ahead of Japan (39%), China (6%), and Singapore (3%). \u201cIndia emerges as the most favored market, perceived as a likely beneficiary of supply chain realignments following the effects of tariffs,\u201d BofA Securities stated in its latest fund managers survey. Interestingly, China climbed to the third spot from being the least favoured market in the previous month. Meanwhile, Thailand and Taiwan continue to rank as the least preferred markets among fund managers. Japan, the second-largest Asian market after China, has lagged India in performance so far this year. While the benchmark Nifty50 has risen 4% since the beginning of the year, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 has declined by 4.4% over the same period. The survey further reveals that infrastructure and consumption remain the dominant investment themes in India that fund managers are closely tracking. Additionally, sentiment toward China has improved notably, with the country climbing to the third spot from its position at the bottom just a month ago, according to the survey conducted earlier this month. In the Asia ex-Japan portfolio, fund managers remain overweight on telecom and software sectors, while underweighting energy, materials, and consumer discretionary e-commerce. Notably, sentiment toward semiconductors has improved since April. According to BofA, the share of participants expecting a downturn in the semiconductor cycle has declined to a net 42%, down from 59% last month. According to the survey, a turnaround in the economic growth outlook has boosted market return expectations across the Asia-Pacific region. While a net 58% of fund managers still expect an earnings slowdown, this marks a notable improvement from 78% in the previous month. Additionally, consensus earnings estimates are not seen as overly stretched compared to last month, suggesting there is room for upward revisions going forward. A total of 208 panelists, collectively managing $522 billion in assets, participated in the survey, according to BofA Securities. Of these, 174 panelists with $458 billion in assets under management (AUM) responded to the global Fund Manager Survey (FMS) questions, while 109 panelists overseeing $234 billion in AUM took part in the regional FMS section conducted between May 2 and May 8, 2025.

            "text": "HomeMarket NewsChemplast Sanmar announces foray into a key component of SRF, Navin Fluorine Shares of both SRF Ltd. and Navin Fluorine Ltd. are down 2% each on Wednesday, May 14. SRF stock is down for the second day in a row, while Navin Fluorine shares are down for third day running. The decline comes after Chemplast Sanmar announced foray into R32 refrigerant gas segment. Chemplast Sanmar Managing Director Ramkumar Shankar said the company has announced a greenfield capex of \u20b9340 crore for the production of R32 refrigerant gas. \"This project, along with the ongoing MPB expansion under the CMC business, reinforces its strategy to grow in the specialty chemicals space,\" he said in an investor presentation. \"R-32 has zero ODP (Ozone Depletion Potential). R-32 (Class 2L) has a low burning velocity, minimizing flame spread and reducing fire hazards,\" the company said. This development led to drop in share prices of SRF Ltd and Navin Fluorine on May 14. Both companies are major producers of R32, a refrigerant widely used in air conditioning and refrigeration systems. This development led to decline in share prices of SRF and Navin Fluorine. Both these companies are major producers of R32, which is used in air conditioning and low-temperature refrigeration systems. It absorbs heat and creates cool air. While announcing its March quarter results, SRF pegged its capex guidance for FY26 at \u20b92,200-2,300 crore, up sharply from \u20b91,200 crore in FY25, but this primarily relates to projects already announced. SRF's management guided to \"flat-to-slightly positive\" pricing moves in R32 and other HFC refrigerants (R134a, R125) from current levels. R32 export prices are seen eventually catching up with import prices. Management further said that it does not expect a major downturn in HFC prices, even after new capacities by competitors such as Gujarat Fluorochemicals are commissioned. For the refrigerant R32, brokerage firm Kotak institutional Equities now assume a more gradual 5% inflation in price each year versus its previous assumption of 15% per annum; this is consistent with management\u2019s near-term outlook. Navin Fluorine has successfully commercialised additional R32 capacity in March 2025, which is now running at optimal levels. Management highlighted sustained demand and favorable pricing trends for both HFOs and R32s. For FY26, NFIL has planned a capex outlay of \u20b9500\u2013600 crore. The company aims to sustain EBITDA margins above current levels, expected to range between 23\u201327%, by focusing on operational efficiency, enhancing product mix, and controlling fixed costs. Shares of SRF are now down 1.65% at \u20b92,876.55, while those of Navin Fluorine are also down 0.92% at \u20b94,295.90."

After hearing the matter, the High Court adjourned the hearing to May 15. The controversy started following his comment at a recent live music event in Bengaluru, which allegedly offended several Kannadigas. After this matter, a complaint was filed at the Avalahalli police station in Bengaluru, forcing the authorities to file an FIR against him. The Avalahalli police, which is investigating the matter, has issued a notice to the singer and asked him to respond within seven days. However, he failed to respond, prompting the authorities to issue another notice and ask him to appear for questioning. An FIR was registered against him on May 3 under various sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), including Section 351(2) (criminal intimidation), Section 352(1) (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), and Section 353 (incitement to public mischief). The case was lodged in response to a complaint made by Dharmaraj A., the President of the Bengaluru Urban District Unit of the pro-Kannada group, Karnataka Rakshana Vedike. The lawsuit accuses the singer of making remarks that \"emotionally provoked\" and \"hurt the sentiments\" of the community and incited hatred among Karnataka's linguistic communities. Following the FIR, Nigam offered a public apology on May 5, acknowledging the hurt caused by his statements. He took to his Instagram handle and posted, \u201cSorry Karnataka. My Love for you, is bigger than my Ego. Love you always.\u201d Kannada director K Ramnarayan also replaced two songs sung by Nigam in his upcoming film, Kuladalli Keelyavudo. Speaking with PTI, Ramnarayan said, \u201cJust saying sorry will not cut it. Connecting Kannada pride to the national tragedy that happened in Pahalgam is a very grave mistake. He must pay a price for that.\""

The precautionary measure comes amid heightened concern over the possible spread of the virus among animals and staff. The Gorakhpur zoo has been closed for a week after laboratory results from the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) in Bhopal confirmed that the tigress, named Shakti, died from bird flu. Zoo Director Vikas Yadav enforced the closure under instructions from the Chief Conservator of Forests, with operations expected to remain suspended until 21 May. So far, four animals have died at the Gorakhpur facility in recent weeks \u2014 including two tigers, a leopard, and a female wolf. The latest casualty was Mona, a female leopard recently transferred from Kanpur, who died on Thursday. Shakti passed away on 7 May, while Bhairavi, a female wolf, died two days later. Another tiger, named Kesari, died under similar circumstances on 30 March.

Samples from the animals were sent to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) in Bareilly and to NIHSAD in Bhopal. While Shakti's infection with H5N1 was confirmed, Bhairavi\u2019s test results are still awaited. The illness of another tiger, Pataudi, who was recently shifted to Kanpur Zoo for medical attention, has raised further concerns about potential transmission. In response, authorities have also closed the Etawah Lion Safari and its associated Asiatic Lion Breeding Centre from 14 to 20 May as a precaution. Although there have been no confirmed cases of bird flu at the safari, officials are taking no chances. Etawah Safari Director Anil Kumar Patel stated that the decision was made out of caution, especially in light of Pataudi\u2019s illness, as he had originally been a resident of the Etawah facility.

All staff must wear gloves, face masks, PPE kits, and regularly sanitise their hands. Dedicated teams have been deployed to maintain hygiene standards and monitor animal behaviour, with daily sanitisation routines now mandatory. Any dead animals or birds discovered on the premises must be immediately reported to senior officials. Meanwhile, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath chaired a high-level meeting in Lucknow on Tuesday, urging officials to exercise maximum vigilance at all wildlife centres across the state. He stressed that the protection of animals and birds housed in zoos, wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, wetlands, and cow shelters should be treated with utmost seriousness. The state government has directed the forest and animal husbandry departments to coordinate closely and respond swiftly to any signs of a potential outbreak."

This situation places India in a strategically awkward position as it balances both geopolitical and trade priorities. Palit notes that while India is actively pursuing multiple free trade agreements\u2014having concluded one with the UK and working towards a significant deal with the European Union\u2014the United States is closely watching these developments. He explained, \u201cThe mother of all FTAs, is expected to come with the European Union and there are issues which the US would want to be given to them, considered to them included in those FTAs and in addition to those FTAs. It is these additional areas, say, for example, opening up India's government procurement market, which was listed as a factor by the US the day before the reciprocal tariffs were announced in the foreign trade barriers report that it brought out.\" These are issues where it is not easy for India to immediately agree, and particularly when you have the threat of a conflict management role being offered to you as some form of a carrot. It doesn't work that way, Palit added. Read Here | Tariff rollback buoys US outlook, S&P Global rules out recession Recently, US tariffs on Chinese goods were cut from 145% to 30%, and China responded by reducing its duties on American imports from 125% to 10%. Palit suggests that the core driver behind this agreement was not trade. \u201cIf you look at the US and China deal, or the issue on which the agreement was done, 80% of it was a discussion on fentanyl. It has nothing to do with any other consideration, any other trade fact, any other trade issues,\u201d he said. He described US trade policy as increasingly ad hoc and disconnected from conventional trade priorities, noting that decisions often stem from broader political objectives. This unpredictable approach, he argued, is becoming more evident to global players. \u201cThere are countries who will have a bigger capacity to resist this ad hocism on part of the US. There are countries which will not. For example, a country like Vietnam, given its dependence on the US market and its strategic position between the US and China, will not have that room for long,\u201d Palit said.

            "text": "HomeIndia NewsEnvironment NewsIn this Indian city, cool roofs and misting bus stops help people survive 42\u00b0C heat For 20-year-old Mayank Yadav, riding a crowded bus in the summer months in this western Indian city can be like sitting in an oven. That makes it a treat when he steps off and into a bus stop outfitted with sprinklers that bathe overheated commuters in a cooling mist. \u201cEveryone is suffering from the heat,\u201d Yadav said. \u201cI hope they do more of this across the city.\u201d Rising heat is a problem for millions of people in India. In Ahmedabad, temperatures this year have already reached 42 degrees Celsius (107 Fahrenheit), a level usually not seen for several more weeks, prompting city officials to advise people to stay indoors and stay hydrated. And yet, coping with that heat is a familiar challenge in Ahmedabad. After a 2010 heat wave killed more than 1,300 people, city and health officials rushed to develop South Asia\u2019s first heat action plan. The plan, rolled out in 2013 and now replicated across India and South Asia, includes strategies for hospitals, government officials and citizens to react immediately when temperatures rise beyond human tolerance. Public health officials said it\u2019s helped save hundreds of lives every summer. Read more: Half of 2020-born could face unprecedented exposure to climate extremes: Study City officials, with help from climate and health researchers, have implemented two simple yet effective solutions to help those affected most by heat: the poor and those who work outdoors. By painting tin-roofed households with reflective paint, they\u2019ve reduced indoor temperatures, which otherwise might be up to 5 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than outside. More recently, the city hung curtains woven of straw and water sprinklers at one bus stop so commuters can get relief from the sun and heat. Officials said they plan to expand the idea to other bus stops in the city. Residents said both measures have been a relief even as they brace for at least three more months of sweltering summer. A simple coat of paint makes all the difference Throughout the city\u2019s low-income neighborhoods, hundreds of tin-roofed homes have been painted with reflective paint that helps keep the indoors cooler. Residents said their houses were so hot before the roofs were painted that they would spend most of their time outdoors under any shade they could find. \u201cEarlier, it was really difficult to sleep inside the house,\u201d said Akashbhai Thakor, who works as a delivery van driver and lives with his wife and three-month-old child in Ahmedabad. Thakor\u2019s roof was painted as part of a research project that is trying to measure the impact of the so-called cool roofs. Read more: World records second warmest April; global temperature remains above pre-industrial levels Early results have been promising. \u201cAfter the roof was painted, the house is much cooler, especially at night,\u201d said Thakor. People like Thakor are much more vulnerable to extreme heat because their houses aren\u2019t insulated and, since most of them depend on a daily wage, they must work regardless of the weather, said Priya Bhavsar of the Indian Institute of Public Health Gandhinagar, who is working on the project. Bhavsar said low-cost solutions could be the only respite for thousands of people in the city who can\u2019t afford to buy an air conditioner. Veer Vanzara, who lives in the same area as Thakor and works in a nearby garment factory, said the heat makes his job much worse, especially since his factory has no ventilation. So his family is grateful for the cool roofs. \u201cThe evenings and night are much cooler than before inside our house,\u201d he said. A bus stop that\u2019s become an oasis from the heat. In Ahmedabad\u2019s city center, a 25-meter stretch of a bus stop has been draped with mats made of straw which, when sprinkled with water, immediately cool the hot wind. Sprinklers installed on the bus stop roof lightly spray cool water on the commuters below, providing instant relief from the blazing heat just a step away. \u201cWhen nothing like this was here, it was really hot. What they\u2019ve done is really good. Senior citizens like me can get some cooling from the heat,\u201d said 77-year-old Ratilal Bhoire, who was waiting under the sprinklers with his daughter. Bhoire said when he was younger, Ahmedabad was hot, but it was still possible to walk many kilometers without feeling dizzy, even at the height of summer. \u201cNowadays you can\u2019t do that,\u201d he said.

Concerned about the potential repercussions on the current tourism season, the state government commenced consultations with key industry stakeholders. Tourism Minister Rohan Khaunte held discussions on Tuesday (May 13) with representatives from various segments of the tourism ecosystem \u2014 including the Tourism Trade Association of Goa, water sports operators, shack owners, and hoteliers. Khaunte shared with the media that the early months of 2025 had seen a noticeable rise in tourist arrivals compared to the same period last year . However, he acknowledged the decline in April, attributing it to the exam period and some seasonal factors.

The Pahalgam attack is definitely going to affect tourism this month (May),\u201d Khaunte said. The minister confirmed a spike in hotel booking cancellations, both from within India and abroad, due to safety concerns, following the Pahalgam terror attack that claimed the lives of 26 people. At the meetings, participants were urged to assess potential long-term challenges stemming in the aftermath of the situation in Pahalgam. The tourism department has called upon four- and five-star hotels to explore new strategies and business models. \u201cSometimes, adversity allows us to work towards better opportunities. Five-star and four-star hotels are now talking about MICE, monsoon tourism, and re-evaluating their rates. They have to see the overall scenario of tourism,\u201d he said. Khaunte acknowledged that Goa is increasingly perceived as an expensive destination, citing elevated airfares and accommodation costs as deterrents. \u201cAfter Budgetary announcements, people from the middle-income and higher middle-income categories are likely to become contributors to tourism,\u201d he explained.

The minister expressed optimism that the current downturn is temporary and that normalcy would return once geopolitical tensions subside. He added that the state is intensifying efforts to draw travellers from the UAE and other international markets to promote monsoon tourism. Khaunte highlighted that chartered and scheduled flights are already bringing in visitors from countries such as Poland, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. \u201cThe number of Russian tourists is expected to double in the upcoming year, compared to 2024,\u201d he concluded"

Gaurav Malhotra, Executive Director at Axis Capital, noted that Starlink\u2019s average revenue per user (ARPU) globally ranges between $25 to $30, compared to $4\u2013$5 for mobile operators in India even after recent tariff hikes. Broadband ARPU in India stands at around $7\u2013$8, while Starlink\u2019s plans may go up to $40 in some countries. He also pointed out that while home routers in India are typically provided for free with a security deposit of \u20b92,000\u20132,500, Starlink\u2019s terminal costs range from \u20b925,000 to \u20b930,000.

            "text": "HomePersonal Finance NewsThis strategy helps you buy bigger homes sooner \u2014 but it's not risk-free If buying your dream home feels like a far-off goal, you are not alone. With rising property prices and stagnant incomes, many young Indians feel priced out of the housing market. But there\u2019s a smarter, more achievable way in\u2014property laddering. This approach encourages homebuyers to start small and upgrade over time. Instead of waiting years to afford the perfect home, you buy what you can today, build equity, and gradually move up. \u201cProperty laddering is a smart, goal-oriented approach where buyers start with a smaller, more affordable home and gradually upgrade to more premium properties over time as their financial capacity grows,\u201d says Mukesh Choudhary, Founder of AccuSpace. \u201cInstead of waiting years to afford your dream home, you begin with what\u2019s financially viable today. Laddering empowers young professionals and first-time buyers to enter the market early, build equity, and reinvest profits into larger or better-located properties. It\u2019s not just about owning property\u2014it\u2019s about creating a stepping stone to long-term financial and lifestyle goals,\u201d he adds. The idea is simple: buy a modest home in a fast-growing location, live in it or rent it out, and then sell it after a few years when its value appreciates. The gains from this sale are then used to fund a larger, better property. How it works? Let\u2019s say you currently live in a smaller home and plan to buy a bigger house worth \u20b91.25 crore. You make a down payment of \u20b931 lakh and take a loan of \u20b994 lakh. After repaying \u20b919 lakh of the loan over a few years, you sell your original property for \u20b980 lakh. \u201cDoing so can significantly reduce your debt burden and allow you to repay your loan much faster,\u201d says Atul Monga, CEO and Co-Founder of BASIC Home Loan. \u201cYou use the \u20b980 lakh to prepay a large portion of your existing loan, leaving you with a manageable balance\u2014and a larger home. This step-by-step approach helps you move closer to your dream home without taking on heavy financial stress all at once.\u201d Who should consider it? Property laddering is especially helpful for: First-time homebuyers: You don\u2019t have to wait for a perfect home. Start now with what you can afford. Young professionals: Enter the market early and let property appreciation work in your favour. Middle-income families: Upgrade without taking on massive financial stress. But it's not risk-free While laddering can be rewarding, it comes with risks: Market volatility: Property prices may not appreciate as expected. Transaction costs: Stamp duty, registration fees, agent commissions, and home loan processing charges can eat into profits. Liquidity issues: Selling a property isn\u2019t always quick, especially during downturns. Tax impact: You may have to pay capital gains tax on profits from selling the first property. Loan eligibility stress: Taking multiple loans over time could affect your credit score or EMI capacity. So while it\u2019s a practical strategy, it demands careful planning, sound location choices, and a long-term view."

Raymond Ltd.'s stock crashed 66.05%, hitting a low of \u20b9530, compared to its previous close of \u20b91,561.30. This sharp fall occurred because the real estate business is no longer factored into Raymond's fundamentals. Some mobile trading apps may still be showing the unadjusted price of Raymond Ltd., which could explain the perceived 66% drop. The demerger process was completed on May 1, and May 14 is the record date for identifying eligible shareholders who will receive equity shares of Raymond Realty. Under the approved scheme, shareholders of Raymond Ltd. will receive one equity share of Raymond Realty for every share held in Raymond Ltd. Importantly, those holding shares in Raymond Ltd. have not seen a loss in the overall value of their holdings, as the share price has been adjusted post-demerger. Going forward, these investors will hold equity in both Raymond Ltd. and Raymond Realty, which will operate as an independent entity. Raymond Realty is expected to be listed in the September quarter of FY26. The demerger is part of Raymond Group\u2019s broader strategic overhaul, aimed at unlocking value by creating focused verticals. In the last quarter of FY25, Raymond Realty posted a booking value of \u20b9636 crore, driven by projects such as The Address by GS 2.0, Invictus, Park Avenue \u2013 High Street Retail in Thane, and the JDA project The Address by GS in Bandra. The business reported a revenue of \u20b9766 crore, marking a 13% increase year-on-year. EBITDA stood at \u20b9194 crore, with a margin of 25.3%. Previously, Raymond also demerged its lifestyle business - Raymond Lifestyle, which was listed on stock exchanges in September 2024."

            "text": "After delivering strong growth in FY25, PG Electroplast is targeting a revenue increase of 30-35% in FY26, led by robust demand across key product categories like air conditioners and washing machines. The company clocked a 77% rise in revenue in FY25, with operating margins close to 10%. In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Managing Director Vikas Gupta said the air conditioner segment alone is expected to contribute around \u20b94,000 crore in FY26, up from \u20b93,000 crore last year, while washing machine revenue is projected to grow to \u20b9650 crore from \u20b9440 crore. To support future growth, PG Electroplast has lined up a capex of \u20b9800-900 crore for FY26, with a major portion allocated towards building new plants and expanding its real estate footprint. Around \u20b9350-400 crore will be spent on the RAC (room air conditioner) segment, including the upcoming compressor facility, which is expected to begin mass production by January 2026. This is the edited transcript of the interview. Q: It\u2019s been a good quarter and a strong FY25. Revenue grew 77% and margins are now close to 10%. Let\u2019s talk about the outlook for FY26. Could you break it down across segments like room air conditioners (ACs) and washing machines? There have been some concerns on AC demand due to weather. How has FY26 started? A: For FY26, we\u2019ve already guided for revenue growth of around 30-35%. Breaking it down by product: in air conditioners, we had revenue of about \u20b93,000 crore in FY25, and in FY26 we are targeting \u20b94,000 crore. In washing machines, revenue last year was about \u20b9440 crore, and we\u2019re aiming for \u20b9650 crore this year. All product categories are performing well, and we\u2019re confident of achieving 35% revenue growth for FY26. Regarding demand, yes, there has been a slowdown at the industry level for ACs. However, PG Electroplast serves over 35 brands in this segment. Based on our current order book, we\u2019re confident that our growth will continue. Q: Looking at your growth trends, there has been some volatility. You\u2019ve grown revenue at 100% in some years, then 77% last year, and now you\u2019re guiding for 30-35%. Why is FY26 guidance lower, especially when you're also commissioning new capacity? A: We provide guidance based on current visibility and the order book from our clients. You\u2019ve seen in the past that we\u2019ve revised guidance upwards. So we\u2019ll continue to update you every quarter. As of now, we see growth of 30-35%. Over the next three years, we expect to maintain a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 35%. Q: What about your capex? We believe you\u2019ve planned \u20b9800-900 crore for this year. Could you break that down between RACs, compressors, washing machines and plastics? A: Yes, we\u2019ve planned \u20b9800-900 crore in capex for FY26. We\u2019re positioning ourselves for the next round of growth over the next 3-4 years. Around \u20b9600 crore will go into acquiring land parcels and constructing new buildings. Product-wise, \u20b9350-400 crore will go towards RACs (which includes compressors), \u20b9100 crore will be for washing machines, \u20b9160 crore for refrigerators. So the total, including land and buildings, will be about \u20b9300 crore. Q: On the compressor business, you announced the plan a while ago, why hasn\u2019t the joint venture partner been announced yet? A: We\u2019re still closing the agreement, which is under legal vetting. That should be completed in the next 2-3 weeks. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve already started working with the technology partner on plant development and other aspects. We remain on track to begin mass production of compressors by January 2026. Q: Can you tell us when the JV partner will be announced? A: Within the next 2-3 weeks. Q: If you assume 100% of compressors are used for captive consumption, how much can margins improve? A: Just a clarification. The phase one capacity is 5 million compressors, of which 50% (2.5 million units) will be used internally. That part will be margin-accretive. I can\u2019t give an exact number, but we estimate margin expansion of about 150\u2013200 basis points. Q: On plastics, what\u2019s your current business focus? A: Our plastic moulding business is seeing strong momentum. We crossed \u20b91,000 crore in revenue from this segment alone last year. With current geopolitical shifts and tariff actions, we\u2019re seeing more RFQs from global clients. We\u2019re hopeful that this business will continue to grow and capture global demand. Q: Are you exploring the GLP-1 opportunity, injections, etc. through plastics? A: Not currently. We have existing clients, and we are exploring some global RFQs with them. But as of now, we haven\u2019t entered that segment. We\u2019re open to new ideas going forward. Q: Margins for FY25 stood at ~10%. As in-house compressor production begins, you indicated 100-200 bps improvement in AC margins. What is your margin guidance for FY26 and FY27? A: We\u2019ve also provided PBT guidance for FY26. Please keep in mind we\u2019re in the contract manufacturing space, where very high EBITDA margins are not typical. That said, we do expect some improvement. Q: The government\u2019s electronic component manufacturing PLI scheme has been announced. Are you looking to participate this year? A: Yes, we are evaluating it. We\u2019re in discussions with various potential partners for at least 3-4 components and should be able to share more details in 3-4 weeks. Q: Net working capital days have come down by about 5-6 days. Is there room for more improvement? A: Before the seasonal ramp-up, we typically build inventory, especially for the AC business. As the component ecosystem improves and compressor production begins, we expect further normalisation in working capital."

Siva Chittor, CFO of Sai Life Sciences said, \u201cA large portion of this will come from operating leverage on a counter expansion in the business. That is really what we are seeing today. If you look at what we did last year, we were a little about 20% and then we ended this year at 25%.\u201d He said achieving 20% compound annual growth in revenue and 25% in EBITDA is possible, but growth in the CDMO sector tends to be uneven. Some years may see slower momentum, while others could deliver stronger results. In the January\u2013March quarter of 2025 (Q4FY25), Sai Life Sciences reported revenue of \u20b9579 crore, margins of 27.2%, and a profit of \u20b988 crore. President Trump signed an executive order directing drugmakers to lower prices in the US to match the prices other countries pay. The order gives drug companies 30 days to implement the changes. Chittor said, \u201cNone of us know what exactly would be the final outcome. With that as the preface, what this is leading to from our judgement is that there's a lot of uncertainty, and uncertainty with respect to outsourcing into China.\u201d Sai Life Sciences believes that rising uncertainty will increase the need for diversification, particularly away from China. While short-term fluctuations may occur from quarter to quarter, the company sees a clear long-term trend favoring a more diversified sourcing and manufacturing strategy. The company offers tailor-made services to biotech firms and global pharma companies. It has research centers and manufacturing facilities strategically located in India, the US and the UK. The company currently serves over 280 clients, including 18 out of the top 25 global pharma companies. Sai Life Sciences\u2019 current market capitalisation is \u20b915,628 crore.

Instead, the market is seeing quicker shifts in sectoral focus, making stock selection more important than ever. Select opportunities still exist in segments like industrials, healthcare, and defence, particularly where margin visibility and policy support are strong. \"The core business momentum of defence is intact... not only can Indian companies do it for India, but they can possibly start thinking of some exports, as and when things play out,\" he said. Sanghavi also pointed to ferrous metals as a potential opportunity in the near term, aided by recent policy support. \u201cThe anti-dumping duty has played out as something positive,\u201d he said, adding that the recent earnings season showed commodity companies driving overall results.

The 81-year-old actor shared the stage at the plush Grand Theatre Lumiere with fellow Oscar-winning superstars like Halle Berry, Juliette Binoche and Quentin Tarantino to accept the award from longtime collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio. Trump \"has cut funding and support to the arts, humanities and education. And now he has announced the 100% tariff on films produced outside the U.S.,\" said De Niro, known for films like \"Taxi Driver\", \"Raging Bull\" and more recently \"Killers of the Flower Moon.\" \"You can't put a price on creativity, but apparently, you can put a tariff on it,\" said De Niro, who called on \"everyone who cares about liberty\" to protest against Trump. Organisers stress that they want to avoid politics and focus on the films, but this year's inclusion of movies from Gaza, Ukraine and Iran, as well as Trump's tariff announcement shortly before the festival, has put more focus on the world outside Cannes. Binoche, the head of this year's jury, used her speech to pay tribute to Palestinian photojournalist Fatma Hassona, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza and is the subject of a documentary to be shown at Cannes. OFFICIALLY OPEN Tarantino, the U.S. director who launched his career at Cannes, officially opened the festival, which now runs until May 24, with a mic drop before audiences settled in for the opening film, French comedy \"Leave One Day.\" U.S. actor Eva Longoria, Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda and U.S. director Sean Baker - who won the festival's top Palme d'Or prize last year for \"Anora\" - were seen on the red carpet ahead of the festival. German model Heidi Klum wore a pink flower petal-esque gown that trailed quite a ways behind her - but apparently not long enough to have her denied entry onto the red carpet after organisers changed the dress code recently to ban nudity and over-the-top trains. Berry, who is also on this year's jury, was wearing a black-and-white gown without a train on the red carpet after she said earlier on Tuesday that she had to switch her outfit choice last minute due to the updated dress code.

On May 7, India targeted nine terror infrastructures in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir under Operation Sindoor to avenge the Pahalgam terror attack, which killed 26 people. Following the attack, Pakistan retaliated with cross-border shelling across the Line of Control (LoC) and Jammu and Kashmir, as well as attempted drone attacks along the border. This prompted India to launch a coordinated attack that damaged radar infrastructure, communication centres and airfields at 11 Pakistani air bases. Later, on May 10, an agreement to end hostilities between India and Pakistan was announced."

            "text": "HomeMarket NewsTariff rollback buoys US outlook, S&P Global rules out recession The US economy is unlikely to slip into a recession this year, according to S&P Global Ratings. While growth is expected to slow down sharply, it\u2019s not expected to fall into negative territory, thanks in part to easing trade tensions with China. Paul Gruenwald, Global Chief Economist at S&P Global Ratings, said the rollback and pause in US-China tariffs is offering some support to growth. \u201cWith most tariffs now reduced or on hold, we are back to our earlier forecast from March,\u201d he noted. \u201cChina\u2019s growth is expected around 4% this year, and the US is likely to grow closer to 2% on average.\u201d He added that this temporary pause in the tariff war provides a small but helpful push for economic activity\u2014at least for the next few months. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to watch how it evolves,\u201d he said. Earlier S&P Global Ratings had revised its outlook for the US economy, cutting the GDP growth forecast for 2025 by 50 basis points to 1.5%. For 2026, the growth projection has been trimmed by 20 basis points, bringing it down to 1.7%. While S&P does not predict a recession in its base case, it does expect a sharp slowdown in the US economy. The US has been growing at nearly 3% over the past couple of years. Gruenwald explained that as we move through 2025, growth could slow to between 0% and 1%. That\u2019s a big drop, but not quite a technical recession. Read Here | China more attractive than India on valuations: Lyn Alden When asked if further talks and reductions in tariffs could lead to benefits like lower US taxes, Gruenwald was cautious. \u201cWe were never convinced that tariff revenues would allow for big tax cuts. In reality, tariffs are just extra costs, mostly paid by US consumers,\u201d he said. He welcomed the rollback of tariffs and hoped for further reductions. Lower tariffs help boost growth, support central banks, and keep inflation in check, he added. However, he also warned that US trade policy remains unpredictable. He said, \u201cTrump style is very unorthodox, as we have seen so far, and we have had very volatile trade policy from the US, and we will just have to see how that develops in the coming quarters.\u201d Also Read | Goldman Sachs cuts US recession risk, sees India growth holding firm Follow our live blog for more stock market updates global market outlookMarket analystsUS recessionUS-China tariffs"

The stock has gained in three out of the last five trading sessions, while shares of Suzlon are up for the third day running. Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal has reiterated its 'Buy' rating on Suzlon Energy, with a price target of \u20b975 per share. This implies an upside potential of 30% from the stock's last closing level on Tuesday. The brokerage mentioned in its note that the recent draft Revised List of Models and Manufacturers of Wind Turbines (RLMM) notification mandating local content in wind turbine manufacturing is a key medium- and long-term positive for Suzlon Energy. Motilal sees two key implications from the recent draft RLMM notification: 1) Should the draft receive regulatory approval, it sees competitive intensity moderating in the medium term. 2) There is scope for further market share expansion for Suzlon given Indian OEMs account for barely 50-60% of new orders and the company's integrated domestic manufacturing capabilities across all key components. According to Motilal, Suzlon is focused on raising its share of EPC contracts in the overall order book (20% now to 50% in the medium term), which will be key in providing greater visibility and control in terms of deliveries. Suzlon Energy is currently valued at 24 times its estimated earnings for FY27, and the brokerage believes Suzlon's valuations are attractive following the recent correction. Shares of Suzlon Energy are currently trading 2.13% higher on Wednesday at \u20b958.85. The stock is up 8% over the last one month, but are down 10% so far in 2025.

The company expects its revenue to rise between 30\u201335% this fiscal, which would take total orders to \u20b95,300 crore or more, with a greater share coming from high-margin industrial and healthcare segments, according to Managing Director Jasbir Singh Gujral. \"My industrial and healthcare accounted for almost 50% of my topline,\" Gujral said, adding that both are \u201cmargin accretive segments\u201d. For FY26, the company has guided for 8% EBITDA margins, translating to about \u20b9400 crore in absolute terms. The company's strategy includes reducing reliance on its lower-margin consumer segment, which contributed around 35% to revenue in FY25. \"We did almost four million pieces of smart metering electronics last year,\u201d Gujral noted, adding that the segment will continue to see growth despite some delays and resistance in implementation. In healthcare, Syrma is seeing traction in segments like neonatal care, respiratory and heart monitoring devices, and cosmetic lasers. Gujral said these products not only contribute to current revenue but also build long-term growth visibility, since design-led engagements often translate into commercial production two to three years later. While exports fell just short of the \u20b91,000 crore target in FY25, the company expects to cross that mark in FY26. Export growth will be led by healthcare and industrial electronics. \"Automotive exports are almost minimal, so the growth will come from customers we onboarded in the second half of last year,\" Gujral explained. The company has also taken an enabling resolution for a qualified institutional placement (QIP) of up to \u20b91,000 crore, which may be used to fund inorganic acquisitions or capital expenditure under the government\u2019s component manufacturing policy. \"We are evaluating verticals where we are not present... QIP is something we look forward to,\" Gujral said."

The company has grappled with a series of challenges over the past year: a surge in medical costs, a cyber attack at its tech unit, the killing of its insurance unit head and subsequent public backlash against the industry. UnitedHealth shares fell after medical services costs at the healthcare conglomerate surpassed Wall Street expectations for the first time in two years, even as it beat fourth-quarter profit and revenue estimates. February 21, 2024 UnitedHealth Group\u2019s tech unit, Change Healthcare, is hit by a cybersecurity attack on its systems. February 28, 2024 In a message posted to, and then quickly deleted from their darknet site, the hackers blamed for the strike say they stole millions of sensitive records, including medical insurance and health data, from the company. February 29, 2024 UnitedHealth Group says the cyber attack was perpetrated by hackers who identified themselves as the \u201cBlackcat\u201d ransomware group. March 13, 2024 The U.S. government says it has opened an investigation into the cyber attack to find out whether there was a breach of protected health data and if the company followed U.S. health privacy law. March 13, 2024 UnitedHealth Group says its unit Change Healthcare\u2019s pharmacy network is back online, weeks after the fallout from the cyber attack swept across the country\u2019s healthcare system that depends heavily on insurance. April 16, 2024 UnitedHealth Group says it expects the hack of its Change Healthcare unit to cost the company up to $1.6 billion in 2024, but maintained its annual earnings forecast, suggesting the cyber attack\u2019s impact was less severe than many on Wall Street had feared. May 1, 2024 Hackers who breached UnitedHealth\u2019s tech unit in February potentially stole a third of Americans\u2019 data, the largest U.S. health insurer\u2019s CEO tells a Congressional committee. July 16, 2024 UnitedHealth forecasts a bigger hit to annual earnings from the February hack at its tech unit, but maintains its full-year profit forecast. September 20, 2024 The U.S. Federal Trade Commission sues the country\u2019s three largest pharmacy benefit managers, accusing them of steering diabetes patients towards higher-priced insulin to reap millions of dollars in rebates from pharmaceutical companies. October 15, 2024 UnitedHealth Group provides a 2025 profit forecast below Wall Street estimates as it expects pressure across its government-supported health insurance businesses. November 12, 2024 The U.S. Department of Justice and three U.S. states file a lawsuit to block UnitedHealth Group\u2019s $3.3 billion acquisition of Amedisys, citing concerns that the deal would reduce competition in the home health services market. December 4, 2024 Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealth\u2019s insurance unit, is killed outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel ahead of the company\u2019s investor day in what police described as a targeted attack by a gunman lying in wait for him. December 19, 2024 The suspect in the killing of Thompson is charged with federal murder and stalking crimes in a Manhattan courtroom, alongside state murder and terrorism charges previously announced by New York prosecutors. December 23, 2024 Luigi Mangione, the man accused of fatally gunning down Thompson on a Manhattan street, pleads not guilty to New York state murder charges that brand him a terrorist. January 16, 2025 At the company\u2019s first earnings call since the murder of Thompson, CEO Andrew Witty says healthcare in the U.S. needs to be \u201cless confusing, less complex and less costly.\u201d Witty says the company will work with policymakers to reduce the frequency of prior authorization approvals required before a patient can access medical treatment in its Medicare business for people aged 65 and older or with disabilities. January 23, 2025 UnitedHealth Group names Tim No\u00ebl, the head of its Medicare business, to the top job at its health insurance business, a month after the unit\u2019s former CEO Brian Thompson was killed. January 24, 2025 The company says the cyber attack at its tech unit last year affected the personal information of 190 million people, making it the largest healthcare data breach in the United States. February 19, 2025 UnitedHealth\u2019s insurance unit offers employees in its benefits operations unit the option to accept buyouts if they quit by March 3, CNBC reports. February 21, 2025 The U.S. Justice Department is investigating UnitedHealth\u2019s Medicare billing practices, the Wall Street Journal reports. The health insurer says it is unaware of any new probe underway. February 25, 2025 U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley requests detailed information on UnitedHealth\u2019s Medicare billing practices in a letter to CEO Andrew Witty. April 4, 2025 The U.S. Federal Trade Commission\u2019s lawsuit against pharmacy benefit managers over insulin pricing practices will likely move forward again after being paused amid President Donald Trump\u2019s firing of the agency\u2019s two Democratic commissioners. April 17, 2025 UnitedHealth Group surprises investors with what its CEO said was an \u201cunusual and unacceptable\u201d quarterly earnings miss, and lowers its outlook for the full year due to higher-than-expected medical costs, sparking a more than 20% selloff in shares that reverberated across the sector. April 21, 2025 UnitedHealth Group says it spent nearly $1.7 million on security for its top executives in 2024, months after the fatal shooting of senior executive Brian Thompson. May 7, 2025 The company is sued for allegedly concealing how backlash from the killing of Thompson was damaging its business. May 13, 2025 UnitedHealth Group suspends its 2025 forecast due to surging medical costs, and CEO Andrew Witty steps down suddenly.

            "text": "HomeBusiness NewsFinance NewsHow FEMA is reshaping business mindsets in India Inc beyond compliance The evolution of India\u2019s foreign exchange policies have been a mirror of the country\u2019s development and its relationship with the complex yet integral, global economic landscape. Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA) marked a significant shift from earlier Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 (FERA). Unlike FERA, which was primarily control-oriented, FEMA is focused on facilitating management of foreign exchange with an underlying philosophy that businesses/ individuals would be largely self-compliant with regulators acting as facilitators and post-facto evaluators, enabling responsible growth while maintaining accountability and public trust. The government nonetheless followed a \u201ctrust but verify\u201d stance, passing on the baton of ensuring compliance to Authorised Dealer Bankers (ADBs). Over time, owing to global push to curb tax avoidance, varied interpretations of FEMA, digitisation and availability of data with advanced analytics, regulators are increasingly adopting eagle eyed approach, aiming that principles of FEMA are followed in spirit and substance. Some of the key areas that are seeing increasing scrutiny by Regulators include: The intensified scrutiny resounds with the government's commitment to ensure the integrity and robustness of India's financial system and indicate that mere superficial compliance may not be enough. This signals a need for business houses to shift in their approach towards FEMA compliance \u2014 from a legal necessity to a strategic business imperative. To navigate this landscape effectively, one must focus on transparency, robust documentation, and compliance right from the planning stage of any overseas transaction. It is important for businesses/ individuals to emphasise on substance i.e. cross border structures and transactions are driven by a genuine commercial rationale and not just serve as means to an end. It's essential to avoid unnecessary layering or creation of entities that lack operational substance. Businesses/individuals should also focus on strengthening their governance with robust internal compliance protocols that can withstand regulatory examination. This may include board oversight, internal audits, review of existing structures, experts\u2019 opinion for technical matters and transparent documentation. Lastly, businesses should look at promoting awareness within organisation, i.e. all the key functions like finance, tax, legal, and operations are aligned and informed about the enhanced regulatory expectations. This not only promotes a culture of compliance but also equips relevant stakeholders with the knowledge they need to make informed business decisions. By doing so, organisations/individuals can safeguard themselves from potential risks and position themselves for success in this dynamic regulated environment. In cases, where risks cannot be mitigated, businesses/ individuals can approach RBI for compounding, to clean the slate and start afresh. With the heightened regulatory scrutiny, compliance can no longer be treated as an afterthought. Proactive investment in compliance programmes, internal diligence procedures including revisiting past structures to ensure continued compliance is a must. By staying informed, accountable and responsive, one can not only mitigate regulatory risks but also build trust with stakeholders and position themselves for sustainable growth. \u2014The authors; Aditya Bajoria and Tanya Gupta, are Tax Partner and Director-Tax respectively at EY India.

The stock declined in four out of the last five trading sessions. Bharti Airtel reported strong growth in its net profit at \u20b911,022 crore in the fourth quarter. The company, however, said that net profit for the quarter included deferred tax gain of \u20b94,233 crore. Analysts who have coverage on Bharti Airtel project 5% upside on the stock.

Ais Capital has the highest price target on Bharti Airtel at \u20b92,232, while Emkay has the lowest target for Bharti Airtel on the street at \u20b91,400. Global brokerage firm Morgan Stanley has an 'Equal-Weight' rating on Bharti Airtel, with a price target of \u20b91,870 per share. India business, excluding Indus Towers, delivered a beat on EBITDA for the quarter, led by better-than-expected performance in the Airtel business segment. India (Ex-Indus) capex came in much higher than in Q3. Morgan Stanley estimates that FY25 guidance shows a 9% year-on-year decline, in line with management's outlook. The brokerage noted that the final dividend of \u20b916 per share shows a 100% year-on-year increase, ahead of Morgan Stanley\u2019s estimates. Consolidated net debt increased due to the redemption of $1 billion in perpetual bonds. CLSA has an 'Outperform' rating on the stock, with a price target of \u20b92,030. Q4 consolidated revenue and EBITDA were ahead of estimates, with a positive surprise driven by strong performance in the Africa operations. India mobile revenue and EBITDA grew 1\u20132% quarter-on-quarter and 21\u201330% year-on-year. Citi has a 'Buy' recommendation on Bharti Airtel, with a price target of \u20b91,980 per share. Q4 performance was relatively subdued compared to recent quarters, with India mobile revenue growth slowing to 1.3% QoQ due to seasonality. India and consolidated net debt rose 4% QoQ, primarily due to higher capex in India and cash outflow related to a 5% stake increase in Airtel Africa. Shares of Bharti Airtel ended 2.47% lower on Tuesday at \u20b91,824.50. The stock has risen over 14% so far in 2025.

Canada\u2019s new government will relentlessly protect the nation\u2019s sovereignty as it works to redefine fraught relations with the United States, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Tuesday as his cabinet was sworn in. Former foreign minister Melanie Joly was moved to industry minister, with Indian-origin Anita Anand replacing her as Canada\u2019s top diplomat. With the development, Anita Anand became the first Hindu woman to be appointed as Canada\u2019s Foreign Minister. Soon after the announcement, Anand took the oath with her hand placed on the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred Hindu scripture. \u201cI am honoured to be named Canada\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs. I look forward to working with Prime Minister Mark Carney and our team to build a safer, fairer world and deliver for Canadians,\" she said.

I look forward to working with Prime Minister Mark Carney and our team to build a safer, fairer world and deliver for Canadians. pic.twitter.com/NpPqyah9k3 Who Is Anita Anand? Anand, who was the transport minister and had earlier held the defence portfolio, said in January that she was leaving politics and returning to academia. However, Carney persuaded her to return to the cabinet and take the foreign affairs portfolio after she was re-elected in last month\u2019s election. She has also been a Member of Parliament for Oakville, Ontario. In Carney\u2019s cabinet, one of Anand\u2019s missions will be to pilot the reset of the almost ruptured ties with India that Carney signalled, while managing the delicate relations with President Donald Trump\u2019s America. According to some reports, Anand served at the Ministry of Public Services and Procurement during the Covid-19 pandemic, where she directed Canada\u2019s vaccine acquisitions and health-related commodities. In 2021, she became the Defence Minister and during her tenure, she oversaw Canada\u2019s assistance to Ukraine in the war against Russia and addressed sexual misconduct amongst the Canadian Armed Forces. Her parents had been doctors in India, who migrated to Canada in the early 1960s, reports claim. Anand received first-class degrees from Dalhousie University, the University of Toronto, and Oxford University."

On Wednesday, May 13, we bring to you Info Edge India, the parent company of platforms like Naukri and 99Acres, from Sacchitanand Uttekar of Tradebulls Securities. Here is his analysis of the stock: Technically, an Inverse Head & Shoulders formation on the daily & weekly chart, signals a potential trend reversal. This bullish structure is further validated by the weekly RSI moving above the 50 mark, indicating strengthening momentum. Importantly, the stock has closed above its 200-DEMA for the first time in nearly 8 weeks, reinforcing the breakout strength. This move is supported by strong volumes, both in the cash and derivative segments, lending credibility to the price action. The pattern target is projected around \u20b91,750, while immediate momentum could push the stock towards \u20b91,570. From a risk-reward standpoint, the setup remains attractive. A daily close below \u20b91,395 would invalidate the bullish structure, making it an ideal stop-loss zone for fresh entries. We believe this is a good opportunity to consider adding the stock to one's portfolio up to \u20b91,440, with the expectation of a resumption in its secular uptrend, aiming for targets of \u20b91,570 followed by \u20b91,750 in the coming weeks. Levels of \u20b91,750 imply a potential upside of 20% from current levels. Shares of Info Edge ended 0.8% lower on Tuesday at \u20b91,464.5. Despite a 9% gain over the last one month, the stock is down 16% so far in 2025.

            "text": "HomeMarket NewsSoftBank profit doubles after ByteDance, Didi values surge SoftBank Group Corp.\u2019s profit soared 124% after valuations of tech startups like ByteDance Ltd. rose, in a boost for the Japanese company\u2019s aggressive data center investment plans. SoftBank, which on Tuesday reaffirmed plans to invest up to $30 billion in ChatGPT-owner OpenAI, reported net income of \u00a5517.18 billion ($3.5 billion) in its fiscal fourth quarter. That was helped by the Vision Fund, which swung to a profit of \u00a526.1 billion thanks to gains in investees such as ByteDance and China\u2019s Didi Global Inc. Shares of SoftBank jumped as much as 5.8% early Wednesday morning in Tokyo, their biggest intraday gain in more than a month. SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son and OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman unveiled the US-based Stargate project in January with promises to deploy $100 billion into data centers and other infrastructure. That could rise to more than $500 billion over time. Maintaining a healthy cash flow and balance sheet is key to securing the billions of dollars needed at minimum cost. Son and Altman\u2019s undertaking however coincides with mounting macroeconomic turbulence. Their bid has been stymied as debt investors and bankers reassess the value of data centers, Bloomberg News reported. SoftBank has yet to begin detailed discussions on how the large-scale data center rollout will be financed. \u201cUncertainty is growing and it\u2019s becoming harder to see the landscape ahead,\u201d SoftBank Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto said during an earnings conference. \u201cBut SoftBank has not changed course for 44 years. We are not changing now.\u201d He said it wasn\u2019t true that the Stargate endeavor has slowed. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe the plan has become stuck due to tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that we bring about each project, one by one.\u201d More broadly, SoftBank\u2019s earnings jump reflects its exposure to the startup market after years of Vision Fund investments into hundreds of tech companies. In the March quarter, investors re-rated Chinese firms such as ByteDance that are managing to sustain growth despite economic slowdown back home. Online video darling TikTok has kept up a strong pace of international growth, while SoftBank was also helped by share price increases at Didi and Auto1 Group SE. That outweighed declines at baby-products retailer BrainBees Solutions Ltd. and stock price falls at other publicly listed Indian portfolio companies such as food-delivery app Swiggy Ltd. and e-scooter maker Ola Electric Mobility Ltd. Vision Fund 2, which is backed by SoftBank, logged a $708 million loss, it said. Global investment in AI computing is helping to lift sales at SoftBank\u2019s chip unit Arm Holdings Plc and SoftBank is further strengthening its hold on chip technologies Son believes crucial for AI. It\u2019s announced a $6.5 billion acquisition for chip designer Ampere Computing LLC, that it expects to close in the second half of the year. For the year ended March, SoftBank earned a \u00a51.15 trillion net income, its first profit in four years after springing back from a loss of about \u00a5228 billion in the previous year. Credit watchers are wary about how SoftBank plans to finance its big global ambitions, however. Goto stressed the tech investor\u2019s commitment to keeping its loan-to-value ratio below 25%, saying that the company has the financial strength to weather any volatility ahead. The company is likely to resort to more bonds, loans and asset-backed finance, especially if there is a selloff in equities in the months ahead, according CreditSights analyst Mary Pollock. \u201cGiven the increased macroeconomic uncertainty (including the implications for rates, FX, equity valuations) and the uncertainty around the pace of AI demand, costs, and the appropriate valuations, we are even more concerned for SBG creditors,\u201d she wrote in a note to investors."

            "text": "HomeMarket NewsTata Motors shares fall after analyst downgrades, cut to estimates on cautious JLR outlook Shares of Tata Motors Ltd. will be reacting to their March quarter results, that were reported after market hours on Tuesday, May 13. The numbers were largely higher than expectations and its unit Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) managed to achieve its cash flow guidance for financial year 2025, after its 10th consecutive profitable quarter. Brokerage firm CLSA has an \"outperform\" rating on Tata Motors with a price target of \u20b9805, which implies a potential upside of 14% on the stock from Wednesday's closing levels. It said that JLR is cautious on demand in financial year 2026 due to tariffs and different macro-economic conditions. However, it added that the luxury Passenger Vehicle market will not have much impact due to these tariff-related uncertainties. Despite the uncertainties, JLR is confident of delivering on its EBIT margin in financial year 2026. On the flip side, Jefferies has an \"underperform\" rating on Tata Motors with a price target of \u20b9630, which implies a potential downside of 11% from Wednesday's closing levels. The brokerage anticipates a tough year ahead for JLR, due to the US tariffs, increasing competition in China, and rising customer acquisition costs. Adding to that is a slowdown in the Indian Commercial Vehicle market, and rising competition in the electric PV space, Jefferies said. As a result, Jefferies has cut Tata Motors' Earnings Before Interest, Tax Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) estimates for financial year 2026 and 2027 by 8% and 9%, but has increased its Earnings Per Share (EPS) estimates by 3% to 4%. Citi, who has suspended its rating on Tata Motors, believes that while the management appears positive for its India CV business, there could be some near-term headwinds for the Passenger Vehicles business, particularly within the EV segment. Kotak Institutional Equities has downgraded the stock to \"sell\" from its earlier rating of \"reduce\", with a price target of \u20b9600 per share, implying a potential downside of 15% from current levels. Similar to Jefferies, Kotak sees the near-term to remain challenging for JLR, despite turning net cash in financial year 2025. The challenges could come from weak demand trends in China and the impact of tariffs on the US markets. Loss in market share for Tata Motors in its India CV and PV business also remains an area of concern, according to the brokerage. The brokerage has cut Tata Motors' consolidated EBITDA estimates by 4% and 10% over financial year 2025-2027. Out of the 34 analysts that have coverage on Tata Motors, 19 of them have a \"buy\" rating on the stock, nine say \"hold\", while six have a \"sell\" rating on the stock. Shares of Tata Motors fell as much as 3% on Wednesday before recovering some of the morning losses to trade at \u20b9697.7."

Gustavo Adrianzen announced his resignation in a nationwide address just hours after unpopular President Dina Boluarte had sworn in new ministers, including a new finance chief. All other ministers must resign alongside Adrianzen, including those named earlier on Tuesday, although Boluarte may rename them to their posts as long as she appoints a new prime minister. The cabinet collapse was all but inevitable. The opposition-led Congress had previously scheduled a vote of no confidence against Adrianzen for Wednesday, and the cabinet reshuffle further emboldened congressional groups to insist on ousting him. Boluarte\u2019s popularity rating reached a record low of 2% in an Ipsos poll published this week. Though new Finance Minister Raul Perez-Reyes will have to resign, Boluarte may choose to reappoint the loyal official who has already served as transport minister and production minister during her presidency. He is already Boluarte\u2019s fourth finance chief in her two-year presidency. However, she may weigh the support that Perez-Reyes\u2019 predecessor mustered in the minutes before his removal. As rumors traveled of the potential removal of now-former Finance Minister Jose Salardi, the heads of Peru\u2019s top business groups released a statement in support of his policies. Replacing Salardi months into the role \u201cwill create uncertainty in the economy with a change so quick and premature,\u201d said Jose Zapata, the head of business trade group Confiep in an interview with the RPP radio network just before the new appointment. \u201cAnd we also think he was a minister who has been doing things well.\u201d"

Colonel Sofiya Qureshi became one of the most prominent faces of media briefings when India launched Operation Sindoor against terror hideouts in Pakistan. The court, comprising Justices Atul Sreedharan and Anuradha Shukla, had initiated a suo motu case earlier and mandated the filing of an FIR by Wednesday evening.

Expressing a lack of confidence in the police\u2019s ability to conduct a fair investigation, the Madhya Pradesh High Court decided to monitor the probe into the FIR. In its order, the court stated, \u201cUnder the circumstances, this Court feels compelled to ensure that it monitors the investigation without interfering with the independence of the investigation agency\u2026 In view of the nature of the case and the manner in which the FIR has been registered, it does not inspire confidence of the Court that if the case is not monitored, the Police would investigate fairly, in the interest of justice and in accordance with law.\" This comes as Vijay Shah approached the Supreme Court challenging the Madhya Pradesh High Court\u2019s May 14 order. The top court declined to grant him any interim relief or stay of the FIR registered against him. \u201cSuch a person holding a constitutional office should be responsible\u2026when this country is going through such a situation, he has to know what he is saying.

According to the report, travel companies are witnessing a wave of cancellations: Cleartrip reported a 260% surge in cancellations over the past week. Yatra has seen over 50% of holiday packages cancelled to Turkey and Azerbaijan since May 7. MakeMyTrip (MMT) noted bookings to the two destinations dropped 60%, while cancellations rose by 250%. \u201cIn solidarity with the nation and in the interest of standing together during this time, we urge everyone to defer all non-essential travel to Turkey and Azerbaijan,\" Cleartrip said. MakeMyTrip stated on May 14, \u201cWe stand in solidarity with our nation and out of deep respect for our armed forces. We strongly support this sentiment and advise against all non-essential travel to Azerbaijan and Turkey.\" The company has discontinued all promotions and offers for the two countries. According to the report, Rikant Pittie, CEO and co-founder of EaseMyTrip, also confirmed a dip in sentiment, \u201cMany potential travellers are now opting to delay their trips\u2026 This shift reflects a growing sense of awareness and prudence among Indian tourists in the light of the ongoing geopolitical situation.\" The platform has recorded 22% cancellations for Turkey and 30% for Azerbaijan. Despite the rising cancellations, no direct flights between India and Turkey or Azerbaijan have been cancelled yet, according to flight tracking platform Flightradar24. IndiGo continues to operate two daily flights to Istanbul from Delhi and Mumbai. Turkish Airlines runs daily flights to Delhi and Mumbai and a weekly flight to Chennai. However, demand is falling. Govind Gaur, CEO and founder of travel platform WanderOn, said, \u201cMost Indian travellers with existing bookings to Turkey and Azerbaijan are cancelling their plans and have requested a refund or to reschedule to other destinations.\" Several industry stakeholders have joined the call to boycott these destinations. The Karnataka State Travel Operators Association and various travel entrepreneurs across India have said that despite the two countries benefiting over Rs 1,200 crore annually from Indian tourism, \u201cno business is above our nation\u2019s security and dignity.\" Hari Ganapathy, co-founder of Pickyourtrail, which has suspended bookings to Turkey and Azerbaijan, said: \u201cSome Indian tourists are enquiring about travel to Turkey and Azerbaijan but we are responding to them with suggestions to other safer destinations.\" According to the report, Rikant Pittie said, \u201cTrips to Turkey and Azerbaijan often involve high-value segments such as destination weddings, luxury holidays, and corporate retreats. The financial impact of Indian tourism is considerable.\" He warned of a broader impact across the tourism ecosystem, adding, \u201cA decline in travel from India is likely to have a considerable effect across various parts of the tourism ecosystem in both countries.\" Gaur added, \u201cThe sudden drop in Indian tourists will impact their revenue streams, especially in sectors like luxury travel, weddings, and MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions).\" With Turkey and Azerbaijan falling out of favour, Indian travellers are looking elsewhere. Southeast Asian countries are becoming preferred alternatives. Ganapathy added, \u201cSome Indian travellers are switching to safer destinations like Morocco and Cambodia, which continue to see strong interest due to their accessibility and safety for Indians.\""

            "text": "Several thefts take place in India, and only a few make it to national headlines. But this one theft in Bengaluru has been grabbing attention for its \u201cspiritual cause\". May be it was the accused\u2019s way of apologising to God for the sin committed. The story gets even interesting as the donation given to God cannot be returned, despite being stolen money. And guess the amount? It\u2019s said to be nearly a lakh! The incident took place in Bengaluru on May 5 when a 46-year-old chartered accountant, a resident of Kodandaramapura, handed over a bag containing Rs 1.51 crore to his \u2018trusted\u2019 driver at his home. The driver, Rajesh BN, had been working for the CA for the last 10 years. The 46-year-old man asked Rajesh to keep the bag in car as it had to be deposited in a bank account. However, when he went downstairs to leave for the bank, he could not find either Rajesh or the car. A report in Deccan Herald quoted the CA as saying, \u201cI quickly drove to my office address and found my car parked there. When I called Rajesh, he said he was buying medicine at a store and would return in 10 minutes,\" the complainant told the police. \u201cHowever, he didn\u2019t come back and went incommunicado after that.\" Upon receiving the chartered accountant\u2019s complaint, the police tracked down Rajesh and issued a notice. He appeared before them on May 9, admitted to the crime, and was subsequently taken into custody. A police investigation revealed that Rajesh spent: Money donated through a \u201chundi\" in South Indian temples is usually considered a gift to the deity and is generally non-refundable. According to reports, these donations are used for temple maintenance, activities, and sometimes for government projects. Although temple authorities might consider exceptional cases, the standard practice is that once money is placed in the hundi, it cannot be taken back. Last year in October, a devotee had \u201caccidentally dropped\" his expensive iPhone, worth Rs one lakh, into the \u2018hundi\u2019 of the famous Thiruporur Kandaswamy Temple in Chennai. The temple authorities, however, clearly told him that anything that is dropped into a \u2018hundi\u2019 (donation box) is the property of the temple.

The whole world has seen how Pakistan has irresponsibly issued nuclear threats to India multiple times,\" Rajnath said. There were recent reports of a possible nuclear radiation leak in the Kirana Hills in Pakistan due to alleged Indian strike, however, the Indian military made it clear that they did not target any nuclear facilities in Pakistan. \u201cThank you for telling us that Pakistan has stored its nuclear weapons at Kirana Hills, whatever is there. We did not hit Kirana Hills. It was not on the list of the targets we told you we hit,\" Air Marshal AK Bharti said at a press conference on May 12. \u201cFor 35-40 years, India has been facing terrorism sponsored from across the border. Today, India has made it clear to the entire world that we can go to any extent to combat terrorism,\" he said. In a strong-worded remark, the Minister said that the Pahalgam attack terrorists shot tourists on their foreheads, and India retaliated by inflicting wounds on the terrorists\u2019 chests. \u201cBy carrying out a terrorist incident in Pahalgam, an attempt was made to strike a blow to India\u2019s pride and to break India\u2019s social unity. They attacked India\u2019s forehead, but we have inflicted wounds on their chest. The remedy for Pakistan\u2019s wounds lies in stopping the sheltering of anti-India and terrorist organizations and ensuring that its soil is not used against India,\" he said. Noting the success of Operation Sindoor, Rajnath said that it has sent out a clear message to the terrorist outfits hiding in Pakistan that \u201cthey are no longer safe anywhere\". \u201cThey are now in the crosshairs of the Indian armed forces. The world knows our forces are precise \u2014 and once they lock in a target, we leave it to the enemy to count the damage,\" he warned. Watch India Pakistan Breaking News on CNN-News18.

            "text": "The BBMP\u2019s recent pothole-filling drive has come undone \u2013 heavy rains over the last few days have washed away the quick-fix patches, leaving Bengaluru\u2019s roads back to their broken, battered state. \u201cLast week, we filled around 1,395 potholes. We\u2019ll now conduct an evaluation. A few more have cropped up \u2014 information keeps coming in and we will address each location as it\u2019s reported,\" Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Chief Commissioner M Maheshwar Rao told News18. With the monsoon expected to hit Karnataka early this year, in the first week of June, the civic body is now scrambling to fill potholes and rush through pending road work before the rains arrive. Rao added that all teams are on standby to ensure normal life isn\u2019t disrupted. \u201cYes, more potholes may have surfaced. Our engineers will attend to them as and when we get location data. The goal is to reduce turnaround time for such issues, and also revamp the city into the global brand it is known to be,\" he said. Bengaluru is bracing for a projected week of rain, and with it comes the city\u2019s familiar cocktail of flooded roads, snarled traffic, and the infamous pothole menace. The BBMP, however, insists it is geared up to avoid a repeat of previous years\u2019 chaos. \u201cOur assumption is that Bengaluru can handle up to 60-70 mm of rainfall without major waterlogging,\" Rao said. \u201cThe drainage systems are in place. We\u2019ve installed surveillance cameras across key locations to monitor water levels in real time. Our control rooms are on high alert. If canals begin to overflow or any area shows signs of distress, we\u2019ll move in immediately,\" Rao said. But the real test is whether this preparedness will hold. In September last year, after Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar ordered a large-scale pothole repair drive, the BBMP claimed to have filled thousands of potholes across the city. Yet, those short-term fixes have now collapsed, and the city\u2019s motorists are once again paying the price for substandard work. Adding to the pressure, last month BJP MP Tejasvi Surya lashed out at the BBMP after participating in the TCS World 10K run in Bengaluru. In an open letter to Minister Shivakumar and then BBMP Commissioner Tushar Girinath, Surya called the city\u2019s infrastructure \u201cpathetic\" and said the pride of the international event was quickly overshadowed by broken paths and dangerous potholes. \u201cNot a single stretch was pothole-free. Runners, including senior citizens and wheelchair participants, stumbled and were injured,\" Surya wrote. He termed it a \u201cmissed opportunity\" to showcase Brand Bengaluru on the world stage and questioned the civic body\u2019s preparedness despite hosting a world level athletic event."

Hailing from Gujarat, Colonel Sophia Qureshi is one of the two women officers who briefed the media on \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019 on May 8. Coming from a military family, her grandfather served in the Indian Army. She is married to an officer in the Mechanised Infantry. During the media briefing, Col Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh of the Indian Air Force (IAF) flanked Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri on the dais, who delivered the opening statement from the government. The briefing came hours after the Indian armed forces, under \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019, carried out missile strikes on nine terror targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (POK) in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam attack. Lieutenant Colonel Sophia Qureshi (Army Signal Corps) is the first woman to lead an Indian Army contingent at a multi-national military exercise named \u2018Exercise Force 18\u2019, which is the largest ever foreign military exercise hosted by India. In March 2020, the Ministry of Defence called her the \u201cleading lady\" as she trained the Army contingent.

The officer broke the glass ceiling when in 2016, she became the first woman officer to lead its contingent at the multi-national field training exercise, Exercise Force 18, hosted by India for interoperability in sustaining peace among the ASEAN nations. Her selection to lead India\u2019s contingent at Exercise Force 18 was endorsed by then Southern Army Commander Lt. Gen. Bipin Rawat, who cited her proven leadership, discipline, and field experience as the basis for the appointment. While ruling in favour of granting Permanent Commission (PC) to women officers in the Indian Army, the Supreme Court in 2020 had acknowledged the achievements of Colonel Sophia Qureshi. In its February 17, 2020, judgement, the top court said that absolute exclusion of women from all positions, except staff assignments, in the Army was indefensible, and their blanket non-consideration for command appointments without any justification cannot be sustained in law. The top court also referred to the distinctions achieved by women officers, and put out an example of Col Qureshi\u2019s achievements. Vijay Shah hit the headlines after a video, which went viral, showed him allegedly making objectionable remarks against Col Qureshi. The Madhya Pradesh High Court had castigated Shah for passing \u201cscurrilous\" remarks and using \u201clanguage of the gutters\" against Colonel Qureshi, and ordered the police to file an FIR against him on the charge of promoting enmity and hatred. Taking suo motu cognisance of the controversial statements, the high court had ordered the police to register an FIR against the minister. After drawing severe condemnation, the MP tribal affairs minister said if anyone is hurt by his statement, he is ready to apologise ten times, adding that he respects Col Qureshi more than his sister. \u201cWhat sort of statements are you making.

Local Member of Parliament Jagdish Basuniya confirmed that Burman had been held in a Bangladeshi jail. Speaking to News18, he said, \u201cFrom what we know, he was in jail in Bangladesh. It\u2019s good that he has now been released. We stood by his family throughout. He is our Rajbongshi brother.\" The incident took place in the border village of Paschim Sitalkuchi. Local sources say Burman and his wife, Sabya Bala Barman, had crossed the barbed wire fence with permission from the BSF to irrigate their farmland. Recalling the day of the incident, Sabya Bala said: \u201cAround 8am, we went across the fence to water the crops. Around noon, he left the irrigation pump near the fence and went further into the field, asking me to stay back. That\u2019s when I heard his cries. Four to five Bangladeshi men abducted him.\" Burman was reportedly granted bail on Wednesday and subsequently handed over to Indian authorities later that night. Reacting to his release, BJP leader Amit Malviya thanked \u201cthe Prime Minister and the Home Minister for their outstanding leadership\". \u201cHowever, you may not have heard the opposition raising its voice for the release of Ukil Barman. That\u2019s because the Nehruvian ecosystem has long erased East Pakistan\u2014now Bangladesh\u2014from national discourse, conveniently overlooking the suffering of millions of Bengali Hindu refugees. But that narrative must change. It is time to refocus on West Bengal and reclaim the state\u2019s rich cultural heritage. The first step begins with ensuring Mamata Banerjee\u2019s ouster in 2026.\" Watch India Pakistan Breaking News on CNN-News18.

            "title": "From Kabul to Kashmir: How Amrullah Saleh, The Panjshir Hero With 'Nine Lives', Is Taking On Pakistan",
            "text": "Amrullah Saleh, the former vice-president of Afghanistan, has been one of the strongest voices in India\u2019s support since Pakistan-backed terrorists killed 26 Indian tourists in J&K\u2019s Pahalgam on April 22. His backing of India following Operation Sindoor aligns with his longstanding views \u2014 he has been a steadfast critic of the Taliban, which overran and took control of Afghanistan in 2021, and Pakistan\u2019s meddling in Afghan affairs, including Islamabad\u2019s support to the Taliban. Saleh\u2019s long-stated advocacy for India\u2019s role in countering terrorism and his criticism of Pakistan\u2019s policies provide a broader geopolitical context to the current situation. Saleh, who has served as Afghanistan\u2019s spy chief and interior minister, became the country\u2019s first vice-president in 2020, under president Ashraf Ghani. His tenure, however, was short-lived as the Taliban seized rapid and decisive control of Afghanistan by force on August 15, 2021, following the withdrawal of US troops. While president Ghani was forced to flee the country, Saleh stayed back and relocated to the Panjshir Valley, a historical bastion of anti-Taliban resistance. He declared himself the \u2018caretaker president\u2019 citing the Afghan constitution and formed the National Resistance Front (NRF) with Ahmad Massoud to oppose Taliban rule. His claim to presidency, however, lacks global recognition. Despite the resistance, the Taliban captured Panjshir in early September 2021. As per reports, Saleh had to flee to Tajikistan (he is an ethnic Tajik), but continues to support the NRF in exile. Throughout his career as a spy chief and a politician, Saleh has survived so many assassination attempts that in global circles he is known as having \u201cnine lives\". Amrullah Saleh remains a crucial figure in the Indian subcontinent\u2019s geopolitics due to his unwavering opposition to the Taliban and his consistent criticism of Pakistan\u2019s involvement in fostering cross-border terrorism. As a former Afghan intelligence chief and vice president, Saleh has deep insight into regional security dynamics, militancy, and political influence. His close ties with India, rooted in years of strategic cooperation during the anti-Taliban resistance, position him as a natural ally to New Delhi in its regional security calculus. In exile, his voice continues to resonate in international circles advocating for democratic resilience in Afghanistan and pushing back against Pakistan\u2019s military-intelligence complex. With the intensifying India-Pakistan rivalry, Saleh\u2019s support for India following Operation Sindoor reinforces his role as a symbolic yet strategically significant player in South Asia\u2019s evolving geopolitical landscape. His background and leadership in the anti-Taliban resistance have made him a key figure in the ongoing power struggle within Afghanistan, a nation strategically vital to both India and Pakistan. Saleh\u2019s views and actions have the potential to influence regional stability, particularly regarding cross-border terrorism, the Afghan refugee crisis, and the broader dynamics between India, Pakistan, and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. Saleh has consistently accused Pakistan, particularly its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), of supporting the Taliban and destabilizing Afghanistan. He has stated that Pakistan seeks to exert control over Afghanistan through its proxy, the Taliban. In a 2010 briefing to then US president Barack Obama, Saleh had emphasised that \u201cthe Pakistanis believe the West has lost\" in Afghanistan and are exploiting divisions among Western allies. He has also criticized Pakistan\u2019s role in harbouring terrorist leaders, including Osama bin Laden, and has urged the international community to hold Pakistan accountable for its actions in the region. Given his staunch opposition to Pakistan, Saleh\u2019s support for India in the context of Operation Sindoor aligns with his historical stance. His backing bolsters India\u2019s position in the region and highlights the shared concerns of both nations regarding terrorism and regional stability. Saleh was among the first regional leaders to condemn the Pahalgam terror attack and link it to Pakistan. \u201cIt appears that the neighboring GHQ, seeking publicity and media attention, resorted to the worst way to get it,\" he had said on April 23, the day after the attack. I strongly condemn the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, India. It appears that the neighboring GHQ, seeking publicity and media attention, resorted to the worst way to get it.If the terrorists who carried out the attack are captured, I reckon their weapons most likely\u2026 In the days that followed, Saleh called out Pakistan\u2019s long-standing support to terrorism in the region, also highlighting its defence minister Khawaja Asif\u2019s admission of the same before global media. \"We were contractors for dirty jobs,\" says Khawaja Muhammad Asif, Minister of Defense of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.My question: Has the contract been extended with a new customer, or have you renewed it with the previous one? We see no clear evidence of its termination. https://t.co/HY5xW7TqVF In a pointed comparison between India\u2019s Operation Sindoor and Pakistan\u2019s Operation Bunyan Ul Marsoos, Saleh highlighted several strategic firsts in India\u2019s approach. He said India has showed newfound confidence and sovereignty, \u201cbypassing\" the UN Security Council, treating terrorist actors and their state sponsors\u2014particularly within Pakistan\u2014as a single entity. In his latest post, Saleh said the April 22 attack tested India\u2019s restraint, provoking a robust response that shattered the illusion of Pakistan\u2019s military invulnerability, including strikes near Rawalpindi. He added that India\u2019s religious scholars issued their own fatwa, breaking Pakistan\u2019s monopoly on Islamic religious narratives. In contrast, Operation Bunyan Ul Marsoos, Saleh said, appeared largely performative, with no visible impact, and the ceasefire seemed to prevent further escalation on Pakistan\u2019s side.

            "title": "Maharashtra Water Crisis: Reserves Low In Mumbai, Pune As State Pins Hopes On Monsoon Rains",
            "text": "Even as the first signs of monsoon begin to appear, Maharashtra is already grappling with a worrying water situation. According to data released by the State Water Resources Department on Wednesday, only 28.09 per cent of the total water stock remains in the state\u2019s major dams \u2014 raising red flags for a potential water shortage in the coming weeks. Although this figure is slightly better than last year\u2019s 23.43 per cent on the same day, the useful water stock \u2014 that which is fit and accessible for use \u2014 stands at only 8,166.17 million cubic metres (MCM). This limited availability could prove to be inadequate for drinking, agriculture, and industrial consumption until the monsoon arrives fully and consistently. Pune, one of the state\u2019s key urban regions, currently holds the lowest water stock among all divisions at just 21.52 per cent. On the other end, Amravati has the highest reserve at 38.13 per cent, followed by Konkan (34.15 per cent), Nagpur (32.79 per cent), Nashik (31.35 per cent), and Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar (31.23 per cent). These figures indicate a broad-based issue rather than an isolated one. The total water left in medium projects across the state is 38.98 per cent, while small projects hold 31.55 per cent, and large-scale state projects are down to 29.94 per cent. Mumbai\u2019s reservoirs \u2014 which include Modak Sagar, Tansa, Vihar, Tulsi, Middle Vaitarna, Upper Vaitarna, and Bhatsa \u2014 currently hold just 19.17 per cent of their total storage capacity. The city depends on these seven dams to supply around 4,000 million litres of water daily. Although the current level is better than last year\u2019s 13.63 per cent, it\u2019s far from comfortable for a city of over 20 million people. In Nashik district, the overall dam stock is at 28.36 per cent, amounting to 18,624 MCF (million cubic feet). The Gangapur dam, which supplies water to Nashik city, holds 44.40 per cent, an improvement over last year\u2019s 33.45 per cent. However, other dams in the region, like Alandi (12.62 per cent), Kashyapi (35.58 per cent), and Gautami Godavari (9 per cent), are alarmingly low. The Manikpunj dam has completely dried up, and eight other dams are nearing dead storage levels. Water experts and state officials are closely monitoring the situation. While initial pre-monsoon showers have brought some relief in a few regions, consistent rainfall is yet to begin. Without timely and widespread rainfall, several districts could face severe water restrictions. Authorities are urging citizens to use water judiciously, avoid wastage, and prepare for possible water rationing. Farmers are also being advised to delay sowing until significant rainfall is recorded, to avoid crop loss due to inadequate water. With the monsoon expected to arrive in Maharashtra by early June, the next few weeks are critical. A below-normal monsoon or delayed rains could quickly turn this worrying trend into a water crisis."

            "title": "Allahabad High Court Says 'Muslims Can Have Multiple Wives If...'",
            "text": "A Muslim man can marry more than once if his marriages are conducted under the Mohammedan law, the Allahabad High Court has ruled. The court also said that the man, in such a case, would attract the offence of bigamy if the first marriage had been declared void, Bar and Bench reported. The order, by Justice Arun Kumar Singh Deshwal, stated that the offence will also be attracted if the first marriage was performed under the Special Marriage Act, Foreign Marriage Act, Christian Marriage Act, Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, or the Hindu Marriage Act, and the man performs a second marriage as per the Mohammedan law, after conversion to Islam. The ruling came while the court was hearing a plea filed by a man, who identified himself as Furkan. He sought quashing of the chargesheet and case registered against him for offences of bigamy and rape, among others. A case against him was filed after his wife alleged that his first marriage was not disclosed to her at the time of their wedding. However, Furkan argued that the Muslim law allows him to marry four times. Following the hearing, the court held that offence of bigamy and rape are not attracted against the accused because the marriage is valid in this case. The court, however, said the matter required more consideration. \u201cThe family court has also jurisdiction u/s 7 of the Family Court Act to decide the validity of a Muslim marriage performed in accordance with the Muslim Personal Law,\" the Bench held. The court observed that religious liberty under Article 25 of the Constitution of India is not unfettered. \u201cThis court would further like to observe that Article 25 of the Constitution of India gives religious freedom to profess, practice and propagate, which also includes external overt acts of individual as per his religious faith, but this right is subject to public order, morality and health and other provisions of Part-III of the Constitution. Therefore, religious liberty under Article 25 is not unfettered and can be regulated by the State,\" it stated. The court stressed that the Quran allows polygamy for a fair reason, but men have used it for selfish purposes. Justice Deshwal said polygamy finds mention in the scripture only once, and there is a historical reason why it was allowed. \u201cThere was a time in history when a large number of women were widowed, and children were orphaned in primitive tribal tussles in Arab. The Muslims suffered heavy casualties in defending the nascent Islamic community in Medina. It was under such circumstances that the Quran allowed conditional polygamy to protect orphans and their mothers from exploitation,\" the bench observed. It said that polygamy in the holy book is conditional. \u201cIt is clear that the Quran asks men first consider taking care of the orphans and only when they think they may not be able to do justice to the orphans\u2019 interests while staying in isolation, should they consider marrying their widowed mothers, on the condition that the new family would be dealt with justly on par with the existing one,\" the court said.

            "text": "The social media has been abuzz with claims that Indian missiles hit the nuclear weapons storage facility in Pakistan\u2019s Kirana. Some have posted before-and-after images of the area, while others have been sharing memes claiming that the move was a \u201cwarning shot that panicked the neighbours into begging for a ceasefire\". The International Atomic Energy Agency, however, has now come forward to burst the bubble. The IAEA clarified on Wednesday there was no radiation leak or release from any nuclear facility in Pakistan, and neither there was any radioactive incident as claimed on social media. The Times Of India had emailed a query to the agency, following which Fredrik Dahl from IAEA\u2019s press department responded: \u201cWe are aware of the reports. Based on information available to the IAEA, there was no radiation leak or release from any nuclear facility in Pakistan.\" Earlier at a press conference, Air Marshal AK Bharti had confirmed that India had not hit Kirana Hills. Bharti, with a smile, added, \u201c\u2026Thank you for telling us that Kirana Hills have some nuclear installations. We did not know about it.\" His reaction soon turned into memes with people speculating that the forces had indeed damaged the facility but could not reveal details due to certain protocols. Reports have also emerged about a US Beechcraft B350 Aerial Measuring System (AMS) aircraft being detected in Pakistan\u2019s airspace. This aircraft is part of a US Department of Energy fleet designed to identify radioactive contamination during emergencies, which has fueled further speculation. Pakistan has not commented on the presence of these aircraft in its airspace. However, flight tracking websites like Flightradar24 have shown activity involving an aircraft, identified as N111SZ, a B350 AMS variant, in Pakistan\u2019s airspace. The rumours were further fueled when Tommy Pigott, the US Department of State Principal Deputy spokesperson, sidestepped a question on the matter during a press briefing. When asked if a US team was investigating nuclear radiation leaks in Pakistan, Pigott responded, \u201cI have nothing to preview on that at this time.\" Q: Has US team gone to Pakistan over Nuclear Radiation leaks..US State Dept: nothing to preview on that at this time\u2026 pic.twitter.com/BBIX0jeLZv OpIndia, in an article, mentioned of some unconfirmed reports too that suggested an Egyptian plane, which was carrying Boron \u2014 a substance used to control radioactive emissions \u2014 was spotted arriving in and leaving from Pakistan\u2019s Murree.

            "title": "Turkey Firm Handling High-Security Tasks At 9 Indian Airports Under Govt Lens",
            "text": "In the aftermath of the India-Pakistan conflict, in which Turkey helped Pakistan with drones, government sources suggest India is likely to review contracts given to Turkey-based Celebi Aviation, which handles high-security tasks at nine Indian airports, including in the national capital Delhi and economic capital Mumbai. Though there is no time frame given by the government, sources suggest the government will begin by reviewing financial relations where national security is directly linked. Celebi falls under that category. Earlier, government sources told News18 that India will severe trade ties, should it come to this, given Turkey\u2019s role of supporting a \u201cterror state\". Not just from a national security but also from a political angle, the government is under pressure to be seen to be acting decisively. On Monday, Shiv Sena leader Murji Patel led a delegation to the Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL), urging them to end their association with Celebi NAS Airport Services, which currently handles around 70 per cent of the ground operations at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport. The Maharashtra opposition leader issued a 10-day ultimatum to MIAL to cancel the contract, warning of protests if no action is taken. But politics is just a small part of it. The bigger concern is its national security vulnerabilities. Defence analyst Abhijit Iyer-Mitra told News18: \u201cThe matter is far more serious than it appears to be. We suspect around 10 per cent of the firm is owned by Sumeyye Erdogan, daughter of Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Sumeyye Erdogan is married to Sel\u00e7uk Bayraktar, the man who produces Bayraktar drones which Pakistan used against India. The Celebi terminal in Delhi overlooks the VVIP technical area where electronic intelligence aircraft are stationed. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s VIP aircraft comes in the vicinity. I don\u2019t need to spell out that this is alarming.\" Aviation consultant Sanjay Lazar claims Celebi was granted security clearance, ironically after 26/11, when the UPA government was in power. \u201cMany aviation trade unions affiliated to the Shiv Sena, (including ours) under late Balasaheb Thackeray-ji had vigorously opposed the entry of Celebi\u2026\", he said on social media. Lazar adds that Celebi tried to cover up their Turkish ownership whenever the issue surfaced due to friction with India. Celebi began operations in India in 2008 and has since expanded to nine airports: Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Cochin, Ahmedabad, Goa (Manohar International), and Kannur. It provides ground handling, cargo, and aviation services through two main entities: Celebi Airport Services India Pvt Ltd. for ground handling and Celebi Delhi Cargo Terminal Management India Pvt Ltd for cargo services. Services include passenger handling, ramp operations, load control, flight operations, cargo and postal services, warehouse management, bridge-mounted equipment, and general aviation support. Celebi handles over 58,000 flights and 540,000 tons of cargo annually in India, employing around 7,800 staff. But with Turkey taking a clear side in India\u2019s conflict with Pakistan and arming them with drones, the firm is now under the government\u2019s lens."

            "text": "In a sharp response to the Supreme Court\u2019s verdict on fixing deadlines for the governor and the President to decide on state Bills, President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday asked the apex court how it could have given such a ruling when the Constitution had no such stipulations. The President\u2019s response came after the Supreme Court bench comprising Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan, in April, permitted judicial intervention if Governors delay assent to legislative bills for an extended period. Additionally, the bench noted that the President must take a decision within three months on bills referred by Governors. Murmu on Tuesday asked a few questions to the Supreme Court regarding its decisions regarding fixing deadlines for President and Governors nod for Bills: The President mentioned Articles 200 and 201, applicable to Governors and the President respectively, and stated that they \u201cdo not stipulate any time frame or procedure\" to be followed by them while considering the grant or refusal of assent to a Bill passed by an Assembly. In April this year, the Supreme Court passed a judgement in response to a November 2023 petition filed by the Tamil Nadu government against the State\u2019s Governor indefinitely withholding assent to 10 Bills passed by the state Assembly, some as early as 2020. Delivering a verdict, the Supreme Court ruled that the President must decide on state Bills, reserved by Governors for Presidential assent, within three months. The Apex Court set aside Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi\u2019s decision to withhold assent to 10 pending Bills and ruled that the President should also not take more than three months to deliver decision on Bills referred by Governors."

            "text": "From automobile to IT, metro rail to tunnel \u2013 with Turkish firms and companies operating across at least five states \u2013 Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, and Delhi, along with several MoUs signed across sectors \u2013 the bilateral trade between the two nations stood at US$ 10.4 billion during FY24. \u201cTurkey occupies the 45th position in FDI equity inflows into India with a cumulative FDI number of US$ 240.18 million from April 2000-September 2024,\" reveals a review report, dated February, 2025 by India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), a trust established by the Department of Commerce, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India. These investments span strategic sectors like construction, manufacturing, aviation, and metro rail infrastructure and also knowledge sharing sectors like education and media. Meanwhile, several Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) have also been signed between the two nations over the last decade \u2014 ranging from trade in poppy seeds to cooperation in telecommunications, culture, education, media and even diplomacy. But behind the scenes, a quiet yet deliberate shift is underway after Operation Sindoor. The Modi government is now working systematically to reassess and scrutinise \u2014 and in some cases, terminate \u2014 Turkish business agreements and projects in India. A senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that \u201call projects involving Turkish firms are under scrutiny, government is re-assessing all ties including the ones which ended,\" adding that the government is currently focused on collecting, compiling detailed data and deeds related to each engagement across the public and private sector projects. In 2020, a Turkish company was assigned the electromechanical part for Atal tunnel in J&K and in 2024, RVNL signed a MoU with another Turkish company for the metro rail project. Turkey has been a trade, construction and technology partner for India for over a decade, however \u2018change in strategy\u2019 along with diplomatic clarity came amid rising geopolitical friction. Turkey\u2019s repeated remarks on Kashmir at international forums and its growing alignment with Pakistan have not gone unnoticed in New Delhi. But, the Modi government, typically cautious about open retaliatory moves, earlier appeared to be recalibrating its economic and strategic exposure to Ankara through what insiders describe as a \u2018silent unwind\u2019 of bilateral business ties. However, post Operation Sindoor, and what followed next, the government has now decided to bring a shift in its bilateral policy with the country. Talking to News 18, a senior trade expert, working with the ministry said, \u201cAll agreements are being scrutinised. But some MoUs or trade deals or project tie ups were done on a long-term basis. They might not be affected following the current geo-political situation. However, the emerging circumstances and Turkey\u2019s continuous interference over the Kashmir issue may adversely affect the growth of investments or any future trade deals.\" Among the key Turkish players in India, there are construction companies involved in metro rail projects in cities like Lucknow, Pune, and Mumbai. A firm, through its joint venture with an Indian industry, has established a manufacturing unit in Gujarat, while another aviation company, seen as a prominent Turkish entity, operates in Indian airports. These are not small footprints \u2013 they represent critical infrastructure and public-facing services, said the senior official. Significantly, the 2017 visit of Turkish president Erdo\u011fan to India had led to a flurry of cooperation agreements, including media collaboration, and training partnerships between diplomatic academies. But nearly eight years on, those promises of synergy are now giving way to a sterner reality \u2013 economic distancing born out of geopolitical divergence. For now, the Modi government has chosen a low-decibel approach. As of now, no official cancellation has been announced, but the intent is unmistakable. As India asserts itself globally, partnerships that do not align with its core strategic interests despite being economically viable may face a quiet exit.

            "title": "India-Pakistan Tensions: How BSF Stood Firm & Struck Hard With No Additional Deployment",
            "text": "As cross-border tensions flared along the western front amid escalations from Pakistan, the Border Security Force (BSF) emerged not just as India\u2019s first line of defence\u2014but also its sharpest, standing tall alongside the armed forces. Over the past week, which saw a war-like situation, the force demonstrated remarkable courage and effectiveness in countering Pakistan-backed infiltration and aggression\u2014all while operating with no increase in number of troops across volatile and expansive frontiers. From the sands of Rajasthan and Gujarat to the hostile terrain of Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir, the BSF continued to guard India\u2019s western boundary with resolve, resilience, and exceptional efficiency. According to an official, the BSF, with the same strength, gave a befitting reply to Pakistan, damaging their systems and eliminating terrorists attempting to infiltrate into India. The official added that while the primary focus was Jammu, the force did not neglect Rajasthan and Gujarat either. \u201cSince there was a chance that Pakistan could infiltrate if we switched off floodlights, we kept them on and stood firm even during the attack to ensure no one crossed over,\" the official told News18 on the condition of anonymity. \u201cWhile Pakistan expected low visibility due to aerial fire, we struck hard\u2014damaging their surveillance infrastructure and other key systems.\" What makes this operation stand out is that it was achieved without any reinforcement or additional deployment. Even while guarding four states\u2014Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab, and J&K\u2014BSF managed critical operations and retaliations with no extra manpower. On May 9, in response to unprovoked Pakistani firing on BSF posts in Jammu, the force struck deep, destroying a terrorist launch pad at Looni in District Sialkot (Pakistan), inflicting a significant blow to enemy infrastructure. The BSF\u2019s swift and surgical action drew praise from the highest levels of national leadership. PM Modi said: \u201cI salute every individual of the Air Force, Navy, Army, and BSF. Their courage is the armour of our sovereignty.\" In a joint briefing, the DGMO made a rare and powerful statement while praising BSF. \u201cBSF was an equal participant in our response. From their DG to their Prahari at the BOP\u2014they stood shoulder to shoulder with us,\" Lt General Rajiv Ghai said. The night of May 8, 2025, marked a major test\u2014and a resounding triumph\u2014for the BSF. Around 11pm, a group of heavily armed terrorists attempted to infiltrate Indian territory in the Samba sector of J&K, supported by direct fire from the Pakistan Rangers\u2019 Dhandhar post. Thanks to its advanced surveillance grid and rapid response teams, the BSF detected the movement and launched a precise counter-operation. The result: seven terrorists were neutralised before they could breach the boundary. In a calibrated response, BSF troops targeted and destroyed enemy assets, including the BMG bunker at Dhandhar, as confirmed by surveillance footage. Tragically, two BSF jawans were martyred in the Pakistani shelling. Their sacrifice now stands as a solemn symbol of the force\u2019s unwavering courage.

The mission was earlier scheduled for launch on May 29. The announcement was made by Axiom Space, a US-based commercial human spaceflight firm, and NASA. \"After reviewing @Space_Station flight schedule, NASA and its partners are shifting launch opportunities for several upcoming missions. The new targeted no-earlier-than-launch opportunities, pending operational readiness, are: Axiom Mission 4: 9:11 am EDT, Sunday, June 8,\" NASA said in a post on X. Shukla\u2019s travel to space, onboard SpaceX\u2019s Dragon spacecraft, comes four decades after Rakesh Sharma\u2019s iconic spaceflight onboard Russia\u2019s Soyuz spacecraft in 1984. Besides Shukla, the Ax-4 crew includes members from Poland and Hungary, marking each nation\u2019s first mission to the International Space Station in history and the second government-sponsored human spaceflight mission in over 40 years. Shukla will conduct seven experiments in space that are aimed at encouraging microgravity research in India which hopes to build its own space station by 2035 and send astronauts to the moon by 2047. ISRO has drawn up plans to focus on India-centric food to carry out experiments on the ISS, including sprouting methi (Fenugreek) and moong (green gram) in microgravity conditions. The Axiom-4 (Ax-4) mission will also include Slawosz Uznanski, European Space Agency (ESA) project astronaut, who will be the second Polish astronaut since 1978. Tibor Kapu will be the second national Hungarian astronaut since 1980. Peggy Whitson will command her second commercial human spaceflight mission, adding to her standing record for the longest cumulative time in space by an American astronaut. The Ax-4 crew will launch aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft to the space station and spend up to 14 days at the orbiting laboratory.

On the evening of July 6, 2013, when the girl was returning home from school, Shaikh accosted her and compelled her to go with him, threatening to beat up her family members otherwise, said Advocate Mhatre. He took her to his house and raped her. \u201cWe examined six witnesses, including the survivor and her mother, to prove the case,\" the prosecutor told reporters. The defence argued that the accused was falsely implicated because the girl\u2019s mother wanted a contract which the accused had obtained, for her son-in-law. However, the court rejected this argument, Advocate Mhatre said. The court found the girl\u2019s deposition reliable, noting that a child would not lie.

            "text": "The Allahabad High Court has stayed the suspension of a police officer accused of being in a relationship with another woman despite being married. The bench of Justice Karunesh Singh Pawar, passing the order on May 9, stayed the suspension of Mohammad Mohsin Khan, a government servant, which was issued on the basis of allegations that he was in a sexual relationship with another woman. The order came in response to Khan\u2019s petition challenging the legality of his suspension. The petitioner contended that the state government acted mechanically while suspending him, relying solely on the recommendation made by the additional director general (ADG) of police on March 6, 2025. He highlighted the absence of any independent satisfaction or reasoning recorded by the disciplinary authority before issuing the suspension order. Khan\u2019s counsel further argued that while Rule 29(1) of the UP Government Servants Conduct Rules, 1956, deems entering into a second marriage during the subsistence of the first as misconduct, merely maintaining a relationship with another woman without formalising it into a second marriage does not violate service rules. The suspension, according to the petitioner, was also linked to an FIR lodged against him under Section 69 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) on allegations of adultery or related misconduct. Khan has already challenged the FIR before the high court, which granted him interim protection from the filing of a chargesheet in December 2024. The court took into account previous judicial precedents, including the division bench ruling in VN Daipuria vs State of UP and Shahjahan Khan vs State of UP, both of which clarified the threshold for defining \u201cmisconduct\" in personal relationships of public servants. On these grounds, the high court found prima facie merit in Khan\u2019s contention and stayed the suspension order until further directions. The state government has been asked to file a counter-affidavit within four weeks, and the case is next listed for hearing on July 28, 2025."

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh took a swipe at Pakistan over its economic condition and said, \u201cWhat should I say about Pakistan? This country has fallen into such a bad financial state . Wherever Pakistan stands, a line of people waiting for help starts forming. You must have seen how Pakistan went to the IMF to ask for a loan, while India provides funds to the IMF to lend to other countries.\u201d Rajnath Singh said, \u201cPrime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has, in unequivocal terms, redefined India\u2019s policy against terrorism, stating that any terrorist attack carried out on Indian soil will be considered an act of war. The current understanding between the two countries is based on the agreement that there will be no unwarranted actions from across the border. If such actions are taken, the consequences will go far and wide. At the same time, our Prime Minister has made it clear that terrorism and dialogue cannot go hand in hand, and if there are any talks, they will be on terrorism and on PoK.\u201d Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said, \u201cBy carrying out a terrorist attack in Pahalgam, they tried to strike at India\u2019s pride and disrupt its social unity. They attacked India\u2019s forehead, and we have inflicted wounds on their chest. The remedy for Pakistan\u2019s wounds lies in stopping the sheltering of anti-India and terrorist organisations, and in ensuring that its soil is not used against India.\u201d Defence Minister Rajnath Singh asked if the nuclear weapons safe in the hands of a rogue nation like Pakistan? He further urged IAEA to take pakistan nuclear weapons under supervision. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said, \u201cIf these terrorist activities continue, the actions will escalate. The understanding that has been established is that no terrorist activity will be carried out across the border. And if it happens, it will lead to a far-reaching response.\u201d Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said, \u201cOperation Sindoor is not just the name of an operation; it is our commitment. It shows that India not only defends itself but is also capable of giving a fitting response when the time comes.\u201d Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said, \u201cOperation Sindoor is not just the name of an operation; it is our commitment.

            "text": "The Delhi government on Wednesday took a strong step to check the misuse of the city\u2019s water resources. Water minister Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma announced that all hotels, banquet halls, shopping malls, private hospitals, and other large commercial establishments in the city will now be billed based on the amount of sewage they discharge instead of traditional water meter readings. The minister said the government has no accurate data on the water consumption of many of these commercial entities, and a number of these establishments do not have legal water connections or functional meters, yet they continue to discharge massive volumes of sewage every day. This has led to a significant loss of revenue for the government and unchecked exploitation of public water. \u201cEvery drop will now be accounted for. The more sewage you release, the more you will pay for water. The free ride for those making crores using public resources is over,\" the minister said. In a statement, the government explained that all major private commercial units will be evaluated on the basis of the sewage they release. Water usage will be calculated backwards using sewage output data. \u201cAny establishment without a functional water meter or unable to prove the source of water will be charged based on its sewage discharge. This approach will enable the government to curb water theft and recover lost revenue running into hundreds of crores. Records will be cross-verified with sewage treatment data and commercial licensing information,\" the statement reads. The reforms were necessary, as for years, several big commercial players in Delhi have been using water without declaring their consumption or paying the appropriate charges, sources said. Despite visible sewage discharge, there are no matching water bills, indicating either illegal sourcing or complete bypassing of official supply systems, they added. \u201cThis is not a tax. It\u2019s a question of responsibility. You cannot run massive profit-making operations on free public water and give nothing back. That will not be tolerated anymore,\" the minister warned."

Noida, which has already established itself as a major IT hub and mobile manufacturing centre of the country, would now take a decisive step towards evolving as a high-end semiconductor production centre. India\u2019s strides in the world of semiconductors continue! Today\u2019s Cabinet decision regarding the establishment of a semiconductor unit in Uttar Pradesh will boost growth and innovation. It will create innumerable opportunities for the youth as well. https://t.co/Kl4yms8RGW\u2014 Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) May 14, 2025 HCL Group is one of the major IT companies with a massive software development centre in Noida. It would now partner with the global electronic manufacturing major, Foxconn, to set up the semiconductor unit near Jewar in the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority, Noida, with an investment of Rs 3,700 crore. With the Jewar International Airport coming up in Noida later this year, providing quick connectivity and metro-level infrastructure and lifestyle avenues already existing, the area now attracts top professionals and corporates. IT and mobile majors like Samsung, HCL, Microsoft, Accenture, SAP, Cadence, and several more are already present in Noida. The semiconductor manufacturing base, which will add 2,000 highly skilled direct jobs, would be another feather in the cap for the region. The semiconductor plant will manufacture 20,000 wafers per month with a design output of 36 million units per month. \u201cThe unit near Jewar will start production by 2027. Five semiconductor manufacturing units have been approved by the Modi government in different parts of the country till now. The first one will start manufacturing in 2025 itself. The sixth one is the HCL-Foxconn unit near Jewar, and its first rollout will be by 2027. HCL Group itself chose Jewar as the location,\" said Union Electronics and IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw. The plant will manufacture display driver chips for mobile phones, laptops, automobiles, PCs, and other devices. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath took to social media platform X to thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi for approving the project in Uttar Pradesh. He said that the project will go a long way towards fulfilling the PM\u2019s Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India) vision. Just a day back, Japan\u2019s leading electronic and semiconductor company, Renesas, announced the inauguration of its cutting-edge 3-nanometre chip design centres in Noida and Bengaluru. They would be India\u2019s first design centres to work on cutting-edge 3-nanometre chip design, putting Noida firmly in the semiconductor global league. A state government official said that they will provide the HCL-Foxconn unit subsidy in land price, stamp duty, and electricity, as per the laid-down policy.

            "text": "When Pakistan assumed an aggressive military posture and attacked Indian border cities, districts and targeted India\u2019s military installations, the Indian armed forces deployed a layered air defence system combining both static and mobile platforms in response to Pakistan\u2019s aerial threats. Following the successful targeting of terror hideouts under Operation Sindoor, the Pakistani Army sent drones, missiles, UAVs and engaged in cross-border shelling and firing, targeting the military and civilians alike, as they intervened to save the terrorists India targeted to avenge the Pahalgam carnage. To thwart the Pakistani aerial threat at least six nodes of Akashteer and the Indian Air Force\u2019s Integrated Air Command and Control System (IACCS) were activated across the country, sources told News18. These systems worked together to monitor airspace, identify threats and coordinate responses, they added. The Indian Army and Air Force also established point air defence systems at critical locations using anti-aircraft guns. These were protected by long-range systems like the S-400, forming a multi-layered air defence structure. It integrated data from multiple radars including 3D Tactical Radars, Low-Level Lightweight Radars and the Akash Weapon System. This information was shared with IAF control centres for coordinated action. The IACCS, which operates from fixed installations, fused radar inputs, sensor data and manual reports to create a common air picture. In several cases, incoming threats were detected at their source and neutralised by Indian weapons before they could hit the targets. Legacy air defence guns like the L-70 and Pechora systems were also used to bolster the response, especially at lower altitudes. The air defence system functioned in four layers: These ensured that Pakistan\u2019s aerial attempts were effectively thwarted without allowing any damage within Indian territory. On the contrary, Indian Air Force bypassed and jammed Pakistan\u2019s Chinese-supplied air defence systems, completing the mission in just 23 minutes and demonstrated Indian armed force\u2019s technological edge. Lahore HQ-9 air defence system (supplied by China), Turkish YIWA drones and Pakistani missiles failed to penetrate Indian air defenses while India caused extensive damages to over nine air bases in Pakistan, including Nur Khan air base, one of Pakistan Air Force\u2019s (PAF) most strategic bases. Indian armed force\u2019s technical prowess and abilities were also praised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who on Wednesday met Indian Air Force (IAF) personnel in Adampur Air Base in Punjab thanked them for their valour, who said Indian armed forces have \u201cpaired technical with tactical\" to have an upper hand in the battlefield.

            "text": "Misinformation has overwhelmed social media since India launched anti-terror operations against Pakistan last week, with many Pakistan-based accounts sharing fake visuals and myths in a desperate attempt to mislead the public and win the narrative war. This time, Pakistani social media accounts are sharing an image of a burning pyre, claiming that it shows the last rites of a Rafale pilot of the Indian Air Force, who died when India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). The image quickly went viral, with unverified handles even providing fake names of the \u201cpilot\" and his family. Notably, the Indian Air Force had earlier said that all of its pilots had managed to reach home safely after the attack on Pakistan\u2019s terror camps. However, the Press Information Bureau (PIB) Fact Check unit debunked the false claim, saying that it was actually an image from 2008, which was completely unrelated to the recent India-Pakistan military conflict. An old image is going viral on social media, with many Pakistan-based accounts claiming that it shows the last rites of a Rafale pilot of the #IndianAirForce who died on 7 May 2025.#PIBFactCheck\u274c This claim is completely fake. \u2705 The image is actually from 2008 and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/bud4awxcRP PIB also provided a link of the original image. The photo was of people in Gujarat paying their respects at a mass cremation of 15 school girls, who had drowned after a bus had plunged into the Narmada canal, on the banks of Orsang River on April 16, 2008. Since the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, Pakistan has taken to peddling fake news and misinformation on social media to manipulate public perception. While a terrorist organisation linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) called \u201cThe Resistance Front\" (TRF) claimed responsibility for the attack, Pakistan has denied involvement in the incident. The efforts of the PIB Fact Check unit in debunking fake news and dispelling myths have been vital in helping citizens distinguish between facts and false information.

            "text": "Pahalgam Attack: India is set to submit fresh evidence today to the United Nations Security Council\u2019s 1267 Sanctions Committee, demanding that the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba offshoot, The Resistance Front (TRF), be designated as a terrorist organisation. Sources told CNN-News18 that the team will present proof exposing Pakistan\u2019s terror nexus, specifically highlighting TRF\u2019s role in the Aril 22 Pahalgam attack that killed 26 people. The dossier aims to strengthen India\u2019s push to get TRF \u2014 widely seen as a Pakistan-backed proxy of the terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba \u2014 designated as a global terrorist organisation. The team is also likely to seek sanctions and travel bans on its members. This marks the third time India will approach the 1267 Committee with evidence linking TRF to cross-border terrorism. Previous attempts to sanction the group were blocked despite concrete shreds of evidence, Indian officials have said. Pakistan, a non-permanent member of the UNSC, has been protecting TRF at the council with backing from China for a long time. It reportedly succeeded in preventing the group\u2019s name from being included in a UNSC statement condemning the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack. TRF claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam attack twice. Top sources say India has strong intelligence on Pakistan\u2019s long-standing links to terror groups like LeT, and that its probe into Pahalgam attack aims to expose this terror network. TRF emerged as a shadow group of LeT following the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir in 2019. The National Investigation Agency\u2019s probe has confirmed TRF\u2019s role in planning attacks, killings, recruiting terrorists, and smuggling weapons in Valley. Notably, the Indian government\u2019s decision to expose Pakistan\u2019s terror nexus at a global forum came days after a ceasefire agreement was reached between New Delhi and Islamabad. India launched precision strikes targeting nine terror hideouts in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir under \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019, in retaliation to the Pahalgam attack. The situation quickly escalated after Pakistan launched drone and missile attacks on Indian states, including J&K, Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. India\u2019s defence systems intercepted all the attacks effectively and retaliated with full force. Watch India Pakistan Breaking News on CNN-News18.

            "text": "India appears to have had a \u201cclear edge\" in targeting Pakistan\u2019s military facilities and airfields during the recent four-day confrontation, the New York Times reported, citing satellite images. High-resolution satellite imagery, from before and after the strikes, shows \u201cclear damage\" to Pakistan\u2019s facilities by Indian attacks, according to the report. \u201cThe four-day military clash between India and Pakistan was the most expansive fighting in half a century between the two nuclear-armed countries. As both sides used drones and missiles to test each other\u2019s air defences and hit military facilities, they claimed to inflict severe damage,\" the report said. It added that satellite imagery indicates that while the attacks were widespread, the damage was far more contained than claimed \u2014 \u201cand appeared mostly inflicted by India on Pakistani facilities.\" In the new age of high-tech warfare, the report said that strikes by both sides, verified by the imagery, appeared to be precisely targeted. \u201cWhere India appears to have had a clear edge is in its targeting of Pakistan\u2019s military facilities and airfields, as the latter stretch of fighting shifted from symbolic strikes and shows of force to attacks on each other\u2019s defence capabilities,\" the report said. At Bholari air base, located less than 100 miles from the Pakistani port city of Karachi, India\u2019s defence officials said they had struck an aircraft hangar with a precision attack. \u201cThe visuals showed clear damage to what looks like a hangar,\" the NYT report said. Further, the Nur Khan air base, within a roughly 15-mile range of both the Pakistani Army\u2019s headquarters and the office of the country\u2019s prime minister and a short distance from the unit that oversees and protects Pakistan\u2019s nuclear arsenal, was \u201cperhaps the most sensitive military target that India struck.\" The Indian military said it had particularly targeted the runways and other facilities at some of Pakistan\u2019s key air bases and \u201csatellite images showed the damage\", the report said, noting that on May 10, Pakistan issued a notice for the Rahim Yar Khan air base saying that the runway was not operational. At Sargodha air base, in Punjab Province in Pakistan, the Indian military said it had used precision weapons to strike two sections of the runway. \u201cSatellite images of the sites Pakistan claimed to have hit are limited, and so far do not clearly show damage caused by Pakistani strikes even at bases where there was corroborating evidence of some military action.\" On the Pakistani officials\u2019 claim that their forces had \u201cdestroyed\" India\u2019s Udhampur air base, the NYT report said \u201can image from May 12 does not appear to show damage.\" India carried out precision strikes under \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019 on terror infrastructure early on May 7 in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people. Following the Indian action, Pakistan attempted to attack Indian military bases on May 8, 9 and 10. The Indian armed forces launched a fierce counter-attack on several Pakistani military installations, including Rafiqui, Murid, Chaklala, Rahim Yar Khan, Sukkur and Chunian. Radar sites at Pasrur and Sialkot aviation base were also targeted using precision munitions, causing massive damage. India and Pakistan reached an understanding on May 10 to end the conflict after four days of intense cross-border drone and missile strikes.

            "title": "Despite UGC Ban On Pakistani Degrees, At Least 837 Indian Students Went Between 2022 And 2024",
            "text": "As many as 837 Indian students moved to Pakistan for studies between 2022 and 2024, despite the University Grants Commission (UGC)\u2019s notice against degrees obtained from the neighbouring country. The data from the department of higher education of the ministry of education, however, also shows that there has been a consistent drop in the number of Indian students going to Pakistan. In 2024, only 110 Indian students went to Pakistan, down from 331 in 2023 and 396 in 2022. The numbers in the pre-Covid years were as high as 670 in 2019, as shown in the graph. It is also worth mentioning that the education ministry data, made public in March 2025, was sourced from the Bureau of Immigration (BoI), and these are the number of Indians who disclosed their purpose of visit as study or education while going abroad \u2013 Pakistan in this case. In April 2022, the UGC had issued a notice that students should not travel to Pakistan to pursue higher education, and if they did, they would not be \u201celigible for seeking employment or higher studies in India on the basis of such educational qualifications (in any subject) acquired in Pakistan\". However, it exempted migrants and their children who have acquired higher education degrees in Pakistan and have been awarded citizenship by India. The UGC said the migrants would be eligible to seek employment in India after obtaining security clearance from the ministry of home affairs (MHA). Days later, the National Medical Commission (NMC) also issued a public notice, dated April 28, 2022, saying that any Indian national or overseas citizen of India \u201cwho intends to take admission in MBBS/BDS or equivalent medical course in any medical college of Pakistan shall not be eligible for appearing in FMGE or seeking employment in India on the basis of educational qualifications (in any subject) acquired in Pakistan\". It is important to note that Indians who obtain their MBBS degree from a foreign country, excluding the UK, US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, have to pass the Foreign Medical Graduate Examination (FMGE) to be eligible to practice medicine in India. The screening test is administered by the National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences (NBEMS). The NMC order also said those who had joined Pakistan degree colleges/institutions before December 2018 or later after obtaining security clearance from the MHA were exempted. As per the education ministry\u2019s All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) 2021-22, there are 46,878 foreign students in India, and only 28 were from Pakistan \u2013 15 men and 13 women. The situation between India and Pakistan became tense after April 22, when a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s Pahalgam killed 26 tourists. In response, the Government of India suspended visa services to Pakistani nationals with immediate effect. All existing valid visas issued by India to Pakistani nationals were revoked with effect from April 27, 2025. Following this, Pakistan also cancelled visas for Indians. The Indian government also warned its nationals to avoid travelling to Pakistan. Indian nationals currently in Pakistan are also advised to return to India at the earliest. Watch CNN-News18 here.

            "title": "All In Just 23 Minutes: India Jammed Pakistan's China-Supplied Air Defence, Then Hit Back Hard",
            "text": "In an air raid that lasted not more than 23 minutes, the Indian Air Force (IAF) successfully bypassed and jammed Pakistan\u2019s Chinese-origin air defence systems near Lahore in the early hours of May 7. The air raid and the targeted strikes on terror hubs deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) was part of Operation Sindoor. The air raid was India\u2019s precise military response to recent patterns of asymmetric warfare, a government press release said, referring to the heinous killings of 26 civilians, most of them tourists in Pahalgam, southern Kashmir on April 22. The air defence battery in question included the Pakistan Army\u2019s Chinese-supplied HQ-9 air defence system deployed near Lahore. The government press release said that the site was neutralised during the May 8 morning raid. It further added that the jamming was done with electronic warfare tools and loitering munitions were used to disable and destroy radar installations and missile infrastructure. The press release highlighted that Pakistan Army had attempted to strike Indian military positions across northern and western sectors using their drones and missile platforms. But when they encountered India\u2019s integrated air defence grid, which includes indigenous systems like the Akash missile and legacy platforms such as the Pechora and OSA-AK, they were all neutralised. India\u2019s offensive strike package operated under the Indian Air Force\u2019s Integrated Air Command and Control System (IACCS), which synchronised assets across the Army, Navy and Air Force. The attack faced no reported resistance from Pakistani military\u2019s air defences, which were either jammed or misled using advanced electronic warfare techniques. The government pointed out that no Indian assets were lost in the strike. High-value targets such as radar units and missile batteries were destroyed. Recovered debris showed that Pakistan used Chinese-origin PL-15 missiles and Turkish-made YIHA drones. The operation came four weeks after the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam, which India saw as Pakistan\u2019s bid to use terrorism to create instability in India. Operation Sindoor was India\u2019s response to Pakistan\u2019s state policy of backing terrorists, aimed at degrading cross-border terror infrastructure without crossing the Line of Control or the international boundary. The Ministry of Defence stated that the operation showcased the growing role of indigenous technology in defence. India\u2019s use of homegrown drones, guided munitions and electronic warfare systems played a central role in both offensive and defensive operations during the week of May 7 to 10. The press release said the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) also highlighted the real-time coordination enabled by satellite surveillance. Around ten Indian satellites supported the mission by tracking airspace activity and monitoring threat movement along India\u2019s borders. While details of specific assets used remain classified, the press release highlighted that multiple layers of counter-drone and anti-missile systems had been activated across western and northern India in anticipation of retaliation. Pakistan\u2019s attempted strikes were largely foiled by this grid. The press release from the government highlighted that the decision to go public with the details was meant to underline India\u2019s capability to respond with speed and precision to emerging threats.

            "title": "Wife Can\u2019t Be Denied Maintenance Just Because She Had A Job Before Childbirth: Delhi HC",
            "text": "The Delhi High Court has held that a woman cannot be denied interim maintenance merely on the grounds that she is educated and was previously employed, if she had to give up her job due to the responsibilities of caring for a minor child. The single-judge bench of Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma made the observation while hearing a revision petition filed by the husband against an order of the Family Court directing him to pay interim maintenance to his estranged wife. The petitioner-husband contended that the respondent-wife is highly qualified and was working as a school teacher, earning between Rs 40,000 to Rs. 45,000 per month, including income from tuition. On the contrary, the wife submitted that she is currently unable to work due to her responsibilities as the sole caregiver of their minor son and that her earlier employment cannot be used as a basis to deny maintenance. The counsel for the woman argued that the respondent had to give up her teaching job because of long commute hours and the absence of job opportunities near her residence. Without family support, she was unable to manage both her employment and the responsibilities of single-handedly raising her child. Justice Sharma observed, \u201cThis court finds the explanation both reasonable and justified. It is well settled that the responsibility of caregiving to a minor child falls disproportionately upon the parent with custody, often limiting their ability to pursue full-time employment, especially in cases where there is no family support also to take care of the child while the mother is at work. In such circumstances, the cessation of employment by the respondent cannot be viewed as voluntary abandonment of work, but as a consequence necessitated by the paramount duty of child care.\" In support of its reasoning, the court relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Rajnesh v. Neha & Anr. (2021), which recognised that the decision of a qualified woman to forgo employment to care for the family must be duly considered while deciding maintenance. The court noted that the wife was previously employed as a guest teacher, but had to discontinue due to the practical challenges of managing work and childcare as a single parent. The court upheld the family court\u2019s approach in granting maintenance only for the period after the wife left her job, having correctly assessed the husband\u2019s notional income; a practising advocate, for the relevant period. However, it took note of the fact that the Family Court had not examined the petitioner-husband\u2019s income affidavit or bank statements while determining the quantum of maintenance. \u201cThis Court is therefore of the considered opinion that the learned Family Court has committed no error in appreciating the factual matrix and applying the correct legal principles, including the ratio laid down in Shailja v. Khobbana: (2018) 12 SCC 199, wherein the Honourable Supreme Court had held that mere capability to earn is not the same as actually earning, and being capable of earning alone is not a valid reason to reduce maintenance,\" the Court observed. The judge added, \u201cIt is not the potential earning capacity of the wife but her actual income at the relevant time that is to be considered while determining the amount of maintenance. Thus, the learned Family Court has rightly observed that there exists a material distinction between being \u2018capable of earning\u2019 and \u2018actually earning\u2019.\" Accordingly, the Court remanded the matter back to the Family Court for a fresh assessment of the interim maintenance application, directing that the petitioner-husband shall continue to pay interim maintenance as previously ordered, pending further proceedings. \u201c\u2026taking into account the fact that income affidavit filed by the petitioner herein was not taken into consideration, this Court deems it appropriate to remand the matter back to the learned Family Court. The Family Court shall reconsider the application for interim maintenance afresh, specifically taking into account the income affidavits and bank statements filed by both parties, and pass a reasoned order in accordance with law. The said exercise shall be completed within a period of one month from the date of receipt of this order,\" the Court ordered. Additionally, the Court directed, \u201cIn the meantime, as an interim arrangement, the petitioner shall continue to pay a sum of Rs 7,500/- per month to the respondent/wife and Rs 4,500/- per month to respondent no. 2/minor child, which shall be without prejudice to the final determination by the learned Family Court, and any amount paid shall remain adjustable in future maintenance. The payments shall be made regularly before the 10th day of each calendar month either directly or by deposit in the bank accounts of the respondents.\""

            "title": "Flag Wars: Tiranga Yatras Spark Political Firestorm; BJP, Congress Trade Barbs",
            "text": "Following the flag-off of its nationwide Tiranga Yatra \u2014 positioned as an apolitical show of solidarity with the armed forces \u2014 the political battle over patriotism has flared up once again. The BJP\u2019s 11-day Tiranga Yatra, underway from 13 to 23 May, is being projected as a tribute to the armed forces\u2019 valour during Operation Sindoor \u2014 launched in response to the Pahalgam terror attack. \u201cThere will be no party symbols \u2014 only the national flag,\" said Karnataka BJP president B Y Vijayendra in Shivamogga. The BJP has called on ex-servicemen, their families, farmers, doctors, and citizens to join the yatra. The party said that Operation Sindoor was a stunning success, and the Indian Army deserves every citizen\u2019s salute. \u201cThe Tiranga Yatra is our expression of solidarity, love, and deep respect for the Indian armed forces,\" BJP spokesperson N Ravi Kumar told News18. \u201cThey have taught Pakistan a hard lesson with their tactical brilliance and surgical strikes, while keeping every Indian safe at home. The message is clear \u2014 if even a single Indian is harmed, if even a single streak of sindoor is wiped away, India will not spare its enemies. The Tiranga Yatra is a tribute to their valour, a declaration that every Indian stands with them, and a reminder of how PM Modi has taught terror nations a lesson they will never forget.\" Ravi Kumar said, \u201cThe Tiranga unites the country and its people. It has made Pakistan fear the strength of India and its forces. It has shown that if anyone dares lay a finger on an Indian or inflicts harm, a swift and powerful response will follow. The Tiranga represents the spirit of retribution for those who tried to erase the sindoor from our women\u2019s foreheads. It stands tall above us all \u2014 as the embodiment of our strength, our protection, and our unwavering truth.\" However, the Congress, which conducted a similar Jai Hind Tiranga Yatra on May 9, isn\u2019t buying the BJP\u2019s spin. Its leaders insist the issue isn\u2019t about who marches with the flag, but what lies beneath the government\u2019s silence. \u201cEveryone, including Opposition parties and every citizen of India, is behind the Prime Minister\u2019s decision and his strategy to fight terror,\" said Karnataka Minister Priyank Kharge. \u201cBut the BJP should also be held accountable. They should lay it out to the people \u2014 how did the ceasefire happen? Why is United States President Trump taking credit? Why couldn\u2019t the government stop the IMF from releasing funds to Pakistan during an active conflict? Was the ceasefire dictated by economic reasons? Are we okay with being equated to a terror state?\" Kharge asked. Calling the Tiranga Yatra another opportunity for \u201cchest-thumping,\" the Congress said, \u201cThis Tiranga politics \u2014 it\u2019s just a distraction. The real questions remain unanswered.\" \u201cThe BJP Yatra is just another attempt to gloss over the Prime Minister\u2019s failures \u2014 particularly on the diplomatic front,\" Kharge added. \u201cThere are five key points people need to understand. One, the intelligence agencies failed to detect the Pahalgam attack. Two, the attackers came, opened fire at will, and no one knows whether they returned or are still inside our territory. Three, the government failed to block IMF funding to Pakistan. Four, there is no clarity \u2014 has India\u2019s foreign diplomacy been outsourced to the President of the United States? Five, the Prime Minister has not even communicated with his own citizens or the armed forces about what is actually happening.\" Kharge also criticised the Prime Minister\u2019s delayed appearance after the 22 April terror attack. \u201cHe was missing until 12 May. Then he resurfaces and starts giving us gyaan. Instead of visiting a sensitive area on 13 May, he goes to Adampur. He is the Prime Minister \u2014 he could have gone to any border state to review the situation. But he didn\u2019t.\" The Congress\u2019s Tiranga Yatra was held on May 9 and led by Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Deputy CM D K Shivakumar, who said it was meant to salute the armed forces. \u201cSoldiers are our national pride. We want to salute them. We stand in solidarity with them to convey that the entire country is behind them,\" said Shivakumar. But the BJP was quick to hit back at the Congress\u2019s Tiranga Yatra as well \u2014 saying, \u201cFirst get the map of India right before waving the flag of nationalism.\" The jibe was aimed at the Congress\u2019s recent social media misfire, where a tweet criticising the IMF\u2019s loan to Pakistan featured an incorrect map of Jammu and Kashmir. The post was deleted by an embarrassed AICC after the error was flagged. This wasn\u2019t the first cartographic controversy to hit the Congress. During its December 2024 CWC meet in Belagavi, maps displayed on promotional banners again showed parts of Jammu and Kashmir missing. The BJP, calling it \u201cshameful,\" accused the Congress of trying to appease a particular vote bank and even linked the episode to George Soros."

            "text": "Uttar Pradesh traders too joined the growing boycott of Turkish goods across India on Tuesday, denouncing Ankara\u2019s overt support to Pakistan in the aftermath of the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people, mainly Indian civilians. From Ghaziabad to Gorakhpur and from Lucknow to Meerut, traders took to the streets and began pulling Turkish produce \u2013 most notably apples \u2013 off the shelves. The trigger: Turkey\u2019s continued supply of drones and military technology to Pakistan, allegedly used in cross-border attacks on India. The outcry intensified after reports confirmed Ankara\u2019s siding with Islamabad diplomatically and strategically, even as many nations condemned terrorism and extended support to India. \u201cWe cannot allow our money to strengthen a country that helps Pakistan harm us,\" said Noor Mohammed, a fruit trader at Ghantaghar Mandi in Ghaziabad. \u201cWe learned from media reports that Turkey gave drones to Pakistan, and that was the final straw. Henceforth, no Turkish apple or fruit will be sold in our market.\" India imports goods worth more than Rs 1,200 crore from Turkey annually. Of this, apples and other fresh fruits form a significant portion. While Turkish apples had carved out a space in Indian markets due to their quality and shelf life, traders now say ethics and patriotism come first. \u201cBusiness can wait. The nation comes first,\" said Shadab Khan, another vendor from the fruit wholesale market in Ghaziabad. \u201cTurkey used to make crores through India, and we were fine with that. But if they\u2019re going to use our trade to empower our enemies, they\u2019ve lost all right to our market.\" The boycott is already making its impact felt. Reports suggest wholesale prices of Iranian apples have jumped by Rs 200-300 per 10 kg box, while retail prices have shot up by Rs 20-30 per kg. Traders in several districts said they had cancelled upcoming consignments from Turkey and were actively seeking alternatives from Iran, Afghanistan, and local sources like Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked all importers to stop placing new orders from Turkey. Whatever was already shipped will be the last batch,\" confirmed Ram Babu Verma, a wholesale agent in Lucknow\u2019s Dubagga mandi. This sentiment isn\u2019t limited to Ghaziabad alone. In Lucknow, fruit traders across major mandis, including those in Aminabad and Indiranagar, echoed similar views, with some putting up banners declaring \u201cNo Turkish goods sold here\". In Meerut, local vendors and wholesalers participated in a symbolic burning of Turkish apple crates to register their protest. \u201cWe sell fruits for a living, but we are Indians first. We can\u2019t sleep at night if we know our earnings helped a country that backs our killers,\" said Naseem Ansari, a prominent trader from the city. In Gorakhpur, members of the local Vyapar Mandal have submitted a memorandum to the district administration demanding an official directive to discourage Turkish imports. The president of the traders\u2019 association, Mahesh Gupta, said, \u201cThe boycott must be enforced on a broader scale. The government should intervene and stop all Turkish imports until Ankara publicly changes its stance.\" The economic protest is being strongly supported by nationalist organisations like the Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), which released a statement calling for a blanket boycott of Turkish goods, services, and tourism. \u201cDespite being a NATO member and a self-proclaimed secular republic, Turkey has aligned itself with radical regimes hostile to India\u2019s integrity,\" the SJM said in its official release. \u201cTheir support to Pakistan is not just strategic but ideological. It endangers South Asia\u2019s stability and emboldens terrorist networks. India must respond by cutting all economic and cultural ties.\" The SJM also reminded the public of India\u2019s humanitarian gesture towards Turkey during its February 2023 earthquake disaster. \u201cIndia was among the first to send NDRF teams, military medical units, and over 100 tons of relief material under Operation Dost,\" it noted. \u201cYet today, Turkey has chosen to stab us in the back by supporting our enemy.\" The boycott wave has transcended the mandi system. Travel and hospitality companies like Ixigo and EaseMyTrip have suspended all bookings related to Turkey. MakeMyTrip (MMT), one of the biggest travel portals, has seen a 250% rise in cancellations, along with a 60% drop in bookings to Azerbaijan and Turkey during the past week. Several social media handles have also joined the chorus, trending hashtags like #BoycottTurkey and #NationFirst."

DFI\u2019s vision is to make India a global drone hub by 2030, and it promotes the design, development, manufacturing, adoption, and export of Indian drone and counter-drone technology worldwide. DFI enables ease of doing business, promotes the adoption of drone technology, and hosts several programmes like Bharat Drone Mahotsav. Tata Advanced Systems offers a full range of integrated solutions across defence & security and has served as a trusted partner to India\u2019s armed forces for over six decades. Paras Defence & Space Technologies operates within the defence and space segments, distinguished by Indigenously Designed, Developed and Manufactured (IDDM) capabilities. IG Drones is a drone technology company for manufacturing and R&D of drones, specialised in defence and other industry applications, along with a provider of drone-related services like \u200b drone surveying, mapping, and inspection by industry experts. The company has partnered with the Indian Army, the Government of India, and multiple state governments, among others. The integration of drone warfare into India\u2019s military doctrine owes its success to years of domestic R&D and policy reform. Since 2021, the ban on imported drones and the launch of the PLI (production-linked incentive) scheme have catalysed rapid innovation. The scheme of production-linked incentive for drones and drone components of the ministry of civil aviation was notified on September 30, 2021, with a total incentive of Rs 120 crore spread over three financial years, FY 2021-22 to FY 2023-24. The future lies in autonomous drones with AI-driven decision-making, and India is already laying the groundwork. Defence exports crossed the record figure of about Rs 24,000 crore in financial year 2024-25. The aim is to increase the figure to Rs 50,000 crore by 2029 and make India a developed nation and the world\u2019s largest defence exporter by 2047. India has emerged as a major defence manufacturing hub, driven by the \u201cMake in India\" initiative and a strong push for self-reliance. In FY 2023\u201324, indigenous defence production reached a record Rs 1.27 lakh crore, while exports soared to Rs 23,622 crore in FY 2024\u201325, a 34-fold increase from 2013\u201314. Strategic reforms, private sector involvement, and robust R&D have led to the development of advanced military platforms like the Dhanush Artillery Gun System, Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System (ATAGS), Main Battle Tank (MBT) Arjun, Light Specialist Vehicles, High Mobility Vehicles, Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas, Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH), Light Utility Helicopter (LUH), Akash Missile System, Weapon Locating Radar, 3D Tactical Control Radar, and Software Defined Radio (SDR), as well as naval assets like destroyers, indigenous aircraft carriers, submarines, frigates, corvettes, fast patrol vessels, fast attack craft, and offshore patrol vessels. The government has backed this growth with record procurement contracts, innovations under iDEX, drives like SRIJAN, and two defence industrial corridors in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Key acquisitions such as LCH (light combat helicopters) Prachand and the ATAGS (Approval for Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System) highlight the shift towards indigenous capability. With targets of Rs 3 lakh crore in production and Rs 50,000 crore in exports by 2029, India is firmly positioning itself as a self-reliant and globally competitive defence manufacturing power."

            "title": "\u2018Wheeling Misconstrued As Bravado By Youth\u2019: Karnataka HC Urges Legal Reform To Curb Rising Menace",
            "text": "The Karnataka High Court has called upon the state government and law enforcement agencies to consider introducing stringent legal provisions to combat the growing menace of \u201cwheeling\", a hazardous stunt performed by motorcycle riders. The Court underscored the inadequacy of existing laws under the Indian Penal Code and the Motor Vehicles Act in deterring such reckless behaviour. The Single Bench of Justice V Srishananda, while dismissing a bail application filed by Arbaz Khan, who was arrested for allegedly performing wheelies and assaulting police personnel, observed, \u201cLegislature has to take into consideration that existing statutory provisions relating to reckless and negligent driving is hardly sufficient to curb the menace and therefore, to fill up the legislative vacuum, suitable and stringent provisions are to be incorporated by amending the Indian Penal Code and Motor Vehicles Act to complement each other.\" Highlighting that \u201cwheeling\", the act of lifting a motorcycle\u2019s front wheel while in motion, is often glamourised among youth, the Court noted the stunt has dangerously spread from urban roads to rural areas, creating serious risks for both riders and the general public. \u201cYounger generation riders of the motorcycle are under the misconception that the act of wheeling is bravado and indulge in such perilous stunts, being unaware of the grave risks involved in the said act,\" the Court remarked. The Court said that such perilous misadventures not only endanger the lives of riders and pillion passengers but also disrupt public order and safety. \u201cThe act of a few unscrupulous and unmindful youths in indulging in wheeling would definitely disturb the public order and tranquillity.\" Justice Srishananda stressed that the bailable nature of reckless driving offences under current laws significantly hampers the ability of enforcement agencies to effectively curb such behaviour. Taking judicial notice of the alarming rise in such incidents, the Court urged the state to fulfill its \u201cbounded duty\" to enact tougher measures. It said, \u201cTaking note of the galloping trend and alarming rise in such incidents, it is now the bounded duty of the State and its law enforcement agencies to legislate necessary legal provisions and to take stringent measures to suppress the perilous activity.\" The remarks came in a case involving Arbaz Khan, who was booked under multiple provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 \u2014 including Sections 132, 109(1), 121(1), 115(1), 352, 351(2), 238 read with Section 3(5), 281, 125, 125(a) \u2014 and under Sections 183, 184, 192, 196 and 177 of the Motor Vehicles Act. According to the police, Khan and two others were performing wheelies in October 2024 when they fell off their motorcycle. As the police approached to assist them, they were allegedly assaulted by the accused, who also hurled abuses, used filthy language, and threw a police officer\u2019s mobile phone into the Tungabhadra canal. Dismissing the bail petition, the Court noted the petitioner\u2019s habitual involvement in such offences and his aggression toward police officers. It said, \u201cIn curbing the acts of a few unscrupulous elements that have a deleterious impact upon society at large, thereby disturbing public order and endangering the safety and security of citizens\u2026 the discretionary power vested in this Court cannot be exercised in favour of the applicant.\" The Court concluded that mere filing of a chargesheet does not automatically entitle the petitioner to bail, particularly in light of his past conduct and the seriousness of the present allegations. Noting that Khan is a habitual offender, the Court observed, \u201cMere filing of the chargesheet, by itself, cannot be held sufficient to entitle the petitioner to an order of bail by invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court under Section 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023.\""

As per the policy, the government will retain ownership of ITI campuses and employees, while private partners will be permitted to introduce new courses, invest in high-end equipment, and modernise facilities. Partners can operate under CSR initiatives and will receive incentives such as tax benefits, provided they invest at least Rs 10 crore over 10 years or Rs 20 crore over 20 years. The initiative will begin with 25 ITIs and eventually expand to 100, based on a pilot review. Centres of Excellence will be established based on regional industry demands\u2014such as automotive clusters in Pune and Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar\u2014offering advanced courses in AI, cybersecurity, IoT, robotics, green energy, and more. A job placement cell will also be established within each upgraded ITI. Importantly, the PPP framework ensures that private entities cannot claim ownership over public infrastructure or rebrand institutions. With focus on inclusivity, the policy also aims to increase women\u2019s participation in skill training and foster startup ecosystems through guidance and funding within ITI campuses."

            "text": "Even as Pakistan feels the heat of India\u2019s diplomatic and economic measures, one decision has hurt the country the most \u2013 the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). Fearing a water crisis, Pakistan has now reached out to India. \u201cSyed Ali Murtaza, Secretary of Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of Water Resources, wrote a letter to the Secretary of India\u2019s Ministry of Jal Shakti a few days ago. In the letter, an appeal was made to reconsider the decision of putting the IWT in abeyance,\" an official source told CNN-News18. The treaty was put in abeyance based on a decision of the cabinet committee on security (CCS) on April 23, a day after the Pahalgam terror attack which killed 26. \u201cWe will not give them a single drop of water, come what may,\" Jal Shakti minister CR Patil had told News18 after the CCS took the decision. India had also announced that it will stop sharing flood warnings with Pakistan. India has considered all options, which include taking long-, mid- and short-term measures on the water flow, which will now remain restricted, said sources. For the past two weeks, water has been released to Pakistan on multiple occasions, they said. \u201cWe have responded to the Indian letters by conveying that the treaty remains fully in force and is binding on the parties. There is no provision in the treaty to hold it in abeyance. The Indus Waters Treaty has been successful water sharing arrangement between the two neighbouring countries. The treaty has withstood tests of wars and standoffs\u2026,\" said Pakistan in the letter, according to sources. \u201cHolding in abeyance of Indus water treaty is unilateral and illegal\u2026Pakistan is an agrarian economy. Millions of people are dependent on the water being regulated by this treaty. The Indian decision is equivalent to an attack on the people of Pakistan and its economy,\" it added. As per the 1960 treaty, India got around 30% of the total water carried by the Indus River System located in India, while Pakistan got the remaining 70%. With the IWT suspended, the Modi government is expected to take major steps toward completing the stalled hydroelectric projects. A key meeting is likely to be held this week with Home Minister Amit Shah, along with Water Resources Minister Patil, Power Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, and senior officials from all related ministries. Since the suspension of the IWT, two meetings have already taken place between Shah, Patil, and top officials of the ministry. India, meanwhile, aims to accelerate the stalled hydroelectric projects in Jammu and Kashmir. Under the IWT, India had to give six months\u2019 notice to Pakistan before starting any new project. With the suspension, this is no longer necessary, and data sharing will also cease. It is now possible to initiate new projects on the Chenab and Jhelum rivers and to revive Wular Lake. With the treaty suspended, six hydroelectric projects are expected to gain momentum: Even during his address to the nation on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had made it clear to Pakistan that blood and water will not flow together. Similarly, India will have no trade relations with Pakistan unless they stop harbouring terror. Watch India Pakistan Breaking News on CNN-News18.

            "text": "As the chorus to boycott Turkey and Azerbaijan for supporting Pakistan during the tension with India grows louder, MakeMyTrip (MMT), one of the biggest travel portals, has seen a 250% rise in cancellations, along with a 60% drop in bookings to Azerbaijan and Turkey during the past week. \u201cIn solidarity with our nation and out of deep respect for our armed forces, we strongly support this sentiment and advise all against all non-essential travel to Azerbaijan and Turkey. We have already discontinued all promotions and offers on our platform to discourage tourism to these two destinations,\" said MMT spokesperson. India\u2019s trade ties with Turkey and Azerbaijan face strain as both nations back Pakistan and condemn India\u2019s anti-terror strikesEaseMyTrip & Ixigo Advise Against Travel to Turkey & Azerbaijan Amid Rising Tensions Three hashtags \u2014 #BoycottTurkey, #BoycottAzerbaijan and #BoycottTurkeyAzerjbaijan \u2014 were trending in India since Monday. While many on X have been recommending travel to Greece or Armenia, others have responded with comments about tickets cancelled by them, their friends or relatives as a patriotic gesture. Prashant Pitti, co-founder, EaseMyTrip, told News18: \u201cIt is our responsibility. We were the first to issue a travel advisory on avoiding travel to Turkey. At least 22% of our tickets to Turkey and 33% to Azerbaijan have been cancelled\u2026These numbers are going to increase. This could be the beginning for Turkey as Indian tourism will go down drastically.\" Echoing the sentiment, Subhash Goyal, chairman of The Indian Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Tourism Committee, the expert committee on aviation and tourism, stated that all tourism associations stand firmly with the nation and the Indian Armed Forces. According to the committee, tourism to these two countries could see a 50-60% decline. The committee also cited security risks for Indian travellers and urged the Government of India to issue a travel advisory for Turkey and Azerbaijan. No T\u00fcrkiye, Indians won\u2019t come spending money on tourism in a country that uses the same to arm Pakistan.

In the letter, T\u00fcrkiye urged Indian tourists not to cancel or postpone their travel plans, assuring that there are no restrictions or safety concerns for Indian travellers. Joining the boycott call was actor Rupali Ganguly of Anupamaa fame. She wrote on X: \u201cCan we please cancel our bookings for Turkey? This is my request to all Indian Celebs/Influencers/Travellers. This is the least we can do as Indians. #BoycottTurkey.\" Meanwhile, IndiGo airlines has come under fire for continuing its codeshare agreement with Turkish Airlines. Not just travel, the boycott call has spread to Turkish goods too. The Delhi Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI) on Monday launched a protest campaign urging a complete boycott of goods imported from China and Turkey. Earlier, traders from Uttar Pradesh and Pune joined took to the streets and began pulling Turkish produce\u2014mostly apples\u2014off the shelves. Udaipur traders have also decided to stop use of Turkish marble. The Shiv Sena has also called for immediate termination of a Turkish ground-handling company\u2019s contract at Mumbai\u2019s international airport."

            "text": "The Delhi High Court has said that a woman who left her job to care for her child is entitled to alimony, stating that her decision to stop working was not voluntary, but a result of her duty to look after her child. The order, passed on Tuesday by Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma, said that caring for a minor child often limits a parent\u2019s ability to take up full-time work, especially when there is no family support. Justice Sharma further noted that in such situations, it would be unfair to treat the woman\u2019s unemployment as her own choice. \u201cIt is well settled that the responsibility of caregiving to a minor child falls disproportionately upon the parent with custody, often limiting their ability to pursue full-time employment, especially in cases where there is no family support to take care of the child while the mother is at work,\" the ruling stated. \u201cIn such circumstances, the cessation of employment by the respondent cannot be viewed as voluntary abandonment of work, but as a consequence necessitated by the paramount duty of child care,\" it added. The court refused to cancel a lower court\u2019s October 2023 decision that granted the woman and her child interim maintenance. The man had challenged this order, arguing that his wife was highly educated and had previously worked as a guest teacher earning Rs 40,000 to Rs 50,000 a month. He said the case was filed to harass him and that he could not afford the payments, as he only earned Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 a month as a lawyer in Haryana. The woman, however, told the court that she could not continue working due to her caregiving duties. She said her long commute and the lack of work near her home forced her to give up her job. The court accepted her explanation, calling it \u201creasonable and justified\". The high court directed the man to continue paying Rs 7,500 per month to his wife and Rs 4,500 towards their child. It also asked the family court to review the matter again, while allowing the current arrangement to continue in the meantime."

            "text": "Madhya Pradesh High Court has suo motu directed registration of FIR against BJP Minister Kunwar Vijay Shah for his objectionable remarks on Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, who was part of the media briefings during India\u2019s Operation Sindoor. The High Court said that prima facie offences under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) were made out against Shah for referring to Col Qureshi as \u201csister of terrorists\u201c. Soon afterwards, Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Jitu Patwari filed a complaint against Shah. \u201cA minister from Madhya Pradesh insulted the officers of the army and our sisters. Why is the BJP silent on this?\" he told reporters. Shah, Madhya Pradesh\u2019s Tribal Affairs Minister, sparked a massive row by calling Colonel Sofiya Qureshi the \u201csister of terrorists\", drawing the ire of the Congress party who called for his immediate sacking. Viral videos shared by Congress showed Shah saying, \u201cJinhone humari betiyon ke sindoor ujade the\u2026 humne unhiki behen bhej kar ke unki aisi ki taisi karwayi (Those who wiped the vermilion off our daughters\u2019 forehead\u2026 we sent their sister to teach them a lesson).\" \u201cThey undressed Hindus and killed them, and Modi ji sent their sister to return the favour. Since Modi ji could not remove their clothes, he sent a sister of their community to send the message that if you make the sisters of our community widows, a sister of your community will strip you naked,\" he went on to say. The National Commission for Women has strongly condemned the purported derogatory remarks made against Colonel Qureshi, calling for respect for women in uniform, without naming anybody. \u201cIt is extremely unfortunate that such statements are being made by some responsible persons which are derogatory and unacceptable towards women. This not only hurts the dignity of women in our society but is also an insult to the daughters of the nation who are playing an important role in the security of the country,\" NCW chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar said on X. \u201cDear Colonel Sofiya Qureshi is a proud daughter of this nation, a sister of all country-loving Indians, who has served the country with courage and dedication,\" she added. After a massive backlash online, Vijay Shah clarified his remarks. \u201cWe respect the actions taken by the Indian forces that avenged the Pahalgam terror attack in which the vermilion was wiped off the forehead of our sisters. I don\u2019t want to say anything to those who are twisting my remarks,\" he said. The BJP leader\u2019s remarks were severely criticised by the Congress, including party president Mallikarjun Kharge, who deemed it as an insult to the Indian Armed Forces and demanded the saffron party to sack Shah with immediate effect. \u201cA minister of the BJP government of Madhya Pradesh has made extremely insulting, shameful and vulgar remarks about our brave daughter Colonel Sofia Qureshi. The terrorists of Pahalgam wanted to divide the country, but the country was united throughout \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019 in giving a befitting reply to the terrorists,\" said Kharge on X. Umang Singhar, the Leader of Opposition in Madhya Pradesh, said Army officers had no religion and were not identified as Hindu or Muslim. \u201cMinister Vijay Shah\u2019s statement on the top army officer is not only shameful but it is an insult to both the army and women. Be it an army officer or a soldier, he has no religion, he is not counted as Hindu or Muslim. They have only one religion \u2013 country,\" he said. Colonel Qureshi was part of the tri-services team that conducted press briefings on Operation Sindoor alongside Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh. The Indian military response came after terrorists carried out a brutal attack in Pahalgam that left 26 people dead."

As tensions soared over the Pahalgam terror attack last month, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. India\u2019s successful military operation brought renewed attention to its indigenously developed weapons systems like Akash and BrahMos. In his address to the nation on Monday, PM Modi said Operation Sindoor proved the effectiveness of \u2018Made in India\u2019 defence equipment, and the world was now witnessing the arrival of Made in India arms as a formidable force in 21st-century warfare. India is exporting a wide range of items from ammunition, arms, sub-systems/systems and parts and components to as many as 80 countries, showing its growth from a largely import-dependent military force to a self-reliant one focusing on indigenous production. The Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs) have shown a significant increase of 42.85% in their exports in the FY 2024-25, reflecting the growing acceptability of Indian products in the global market and the ability of the Indian defence industry to be a part of the global supply chain, according to an earlier Ministry of Defence (MoD) statement. A total of 1,762 Export Authorisation were issued in FY 2024-25 compared to 1,507 in the preceding year, registering a growth of 16.92%. The total number of exporters also grew by 17.4% in the same period. The Modi government has set an ambitious target of increasing defence exports to Rs 50,000 crore by 2029. The Government has brought in many policy reforms in the past few years to boost the Indian defence industry, such as simplification of industrial licensing procedure, removal of parts and components from the license regime, extending the validity period of the license, etc."

            "title": "How Turkish Broadcaster TRT Peddled Anti-India, Pro-Pakistan Propaganda",
            "text": "Turkish state-owned broadcaster TRT\u2014widely viewed as a mouthpiece for President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s foreign policy\u2014has amplified anti-India propaganda through a series of media outputs aligning with Pakistani and Chinese strategic narratives. The broadcaster\u2019s content, particularly on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, has triggered national security concerns. The X handle of TRT was briefly banned in India in the early hours of Wednesday amid scrutiny over its coverage. A message \u201cAccount Withheld\" popped up on the screen when the users tried to access it in India. TRT has been accused of relentlessly portraying India as an \u201coccupying force\" in Kashmir, particularly through its controversial series \u201cKashmir Under Siege\". The programme paints the Union Territory as being under illegal military control, echoing Islamabad\u2019s long-standing position. The channel has repeatedly highlighted alleged human rights violations by Indian security forces and has given a platform to Kashmiri separatists and Pakistani officials, thereby undermining India\u2019s sovereignty. Indian cyber agencies allege that TRT\u2019s campaigns are not isolated acts of journalism, but rather part of a coordinated foreign influence network. Analysts have drawn links between TRT\u2019s output and Pakistan\u2019s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), noting shared themes, synchronised messaging, and bot-driven social media amplification. The narratives often mirror Pakistan\u2019s information operations, especially during times of unrest in Kashmir or Indo-Pak border tensions. Beyond Kashmir, TRT has been found to echo Chinese and Pakistani narratives on other sensitive issues. These include: TRT\u2019s editorial line consistently frames India as an Islamophobic state, focusing heavily on domestic policies like the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC), and the Hijab controversy. Intelligence reports suggest the channel selectively amplifies fringe incidents, portraying them as evidence of systemic oppression, thereby fueling communal discord both domestically and internationally. TRT World\u2019s coverage has sparked a debate that touches upon the aspects below: TRT\u2019s content was deemed to incite unrest, particularly in volatile regions like Kashmir. Intelligence inputs highlighted how some videos and articles circulated during communal tensions could radicalise youth and disrupt public order. During the 2020 Delhi riots, TRT-affiliated accounts reportedly circulated misleading footage and unverified claims, including accusations of state-sponsored violence against Muslims\u2014claims that were later debunked. The Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) flagged TRT for non-compliance with India\u2019s IT Rules (2021), including: India views TRT\u2019s coverage as part of Ankara\u2019s broader interference campaign. Turkey\u2019s routine raising of the Kashmir issue at international forums like the UNGA and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has only worsened bilateral tensions. TRT\u2019s editorial strategy is perceived as an extension of this diplomatic hostility. Sources within the Ministry of External Affairs indicated that the action against TRT sends a clear signal: India will not tolerate foreign media outlets acting as proxies for adversarial governments under the guise of journalism. \u201cFreedom of the press cannot be a cover for geopolitical subversion,\" said a senior official on condition of anonymity.

Hostile drone swarms are emerging as a major threat on the battlefield and these \u201cremote toys\", as many observers put it, have been extensively used in the Russia-Ukraine war and the Pakistani forces also used it when it intervened on behalf of terrorists following the Operation Sindoor counter terror ops.

Bhargavastra, equipped with hard-kill technology, features advanced capabilities to detect and destroy small or incoming drones at ranges of up to 2.5 kilometres. The trial involved the launch of micro rockets that met all predefined performance parameters, officials said, according to the broadcaster.

            "text": "India on Wednesday blocked the official X accounts of Chinese state-run outlets Global Times and Xinhua News Agency, citing their role in spreading false narratives against the country for strategic gains. However, the X account of Global Times appeared to be accessible again briefly after being blocked for a short period. CNN-News18 has tracked the inside story of the ban on Chinese media in India which were among the first to propagate unverified claims. \u201cChina wants gains in the global arms and weapons market. Operation Sindoor was an open display of Chinese weapons as Pakistan relies on China for 81 per cent of its weaponry. China didn\u2019t want this to fail in any case but when the Indian system bypassed everything, they started a hybrid war,\" sources told CNN-News18. They added that China wants to expand its weapons market beyond Pakistan and wants to enter Tier-1 markets like France and Russia. In order to further their motive, pro-Pakistan networks used Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to fabricate videos, such as a clip of a burning Rafale jet falsely attributed to Operation Sindoor. \u201cThese were traced to Chinese YouTube channels like \u2018Ai in life\u2019. Old videos of Indian aircraft crashes and a 2021 MiG-21 crash in Punjab were used as proof of Pakistani military success. China\u2019s troll armies amplified these posts across social media, including Global Times and Xinhua. Both were the first to come out with claims of Pakistan shooting down Indian Rafale jets. These reports lacked evidence but gained traction globally due to China\u2019s media influence.\" China\u2019s support for Pakistan\u2019s disinformation campaign is also a means to achieve long-term strategic and economic goals. \u201cChina doesn\u2019t want to lose control of CPEC due to internal reasons in Pakistan such as Balochistan.

            "title": "Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Matuka River Revived: How Farmers Got Their Lifeline On Course",
            "text": "The locals of Varanasi\u2019s Sewapuri have revived a \u201clost river\", with a little help from the Uttar Pradesh district administration. Once a key tributary of the river Varuna, the 27.14-kilometre Matuka, a lifeline for over 5,000 farmers across 26 villages, had faded due to neglect and encroachments. For 70-year-old Bulla Devi, a resident of Admapur village, the fading of the Matuka was more than an environmental loss\u2014it was the disappearance of a childhood memory. \u201cI used to go every day with my mother to bathe in the river. I remember it flowing in full swing. Now, it barely survives the summer,\" she says. Bulla Devi is not alone. It reflects the collective struggle of hundreds of villagers whose lives once revolved around the Matuka. For decades, the river served as a crucial source of irrigation, domestic use, and cultural identity for villages in the Sewapuri block and neighbouring Bhadohi district. Its decline over the past two decades turned fertile lands dry and pushed farmers to rely on increasingly uncertain sources of water. Ramdhani Patel of Matuka village recalled when the river ran freely through the year. \u201cFifteen years ago, there used to be water. But now, apart from the rainy season and a short stretch of winter, the river dries up,\" he says. However, he praises the recent revival efforts: \u201cAfter the digging and cleaning work, we saw water in the river even in winter. That hasn\u2019t happened in years.\" The revival was conceptualised over a year ago. The revival of the Matuka River was taken up as a focused water conservation mission by the Varanasi district administration. Led by Chief Development Officer (CDO) Himanshu Nagpal, the project was implemented in coordination with local gram panchayats. Desilting, clearing encroachments, and building rainwater harvesting structures were central to the plan. \u201cThe river had virtually disappeared in many areas. It had become a dumping ground and was encroached upon in several places. We carried out extensive desilting using JCB machines, cleared waste, and involved MGNREGA workers to manually clean parts of the river. The idea was to restore its natural course and allow water from its origin in Bhadohi to reach downstream stretches,\" said Himanshu Nagpal, CDO, Varanasi. However, to ensure the revival has long-term impact, 14 drop spillways were constructed and seven check dams are under construction. \u201cThese structures are vital for rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge. The collected water will seep into the soil and replenish aquifers,\" Nagpal explained. Dinesh Yadav, a farmer from Mahnag Adamapur, said the revival is changing lives. \u201cEarlier, we used to struggle during the rabi season. This year, thanks to the water that remained during winter, we could use pumping sets to irrigate our fields. It\u2019s a big relief,\" he said. For Bachan Prasad of Ramdih village, about 800 meters from the Matuka, the revival is emotional. \u201cThe river used to flow the whole year. Then, due to poor rains and lack of upkeep, it started drying up. People began calling it a nullah. But it was our river, our pride. This initiative brought that pride back,\" he said. In addition to cleaning and construction work, the administration has focused on preventing future encroachments. \u201cWe\u2019ve instructed village heads to monitor the riverbanks and ensure illegal structures do not come back. Community vigilance is key to sustaining these efforts,\" Nagpal said. The impact of the revival is visible not just in water levels, but in farming practices too. In gram panchayats like Bhishan Dilawarpur, farmers have already used Matuka\u2019s water to irrigate their rabi crops. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge help. If this continues, we won\u2019t have to rely solely on borewells and tankers,\" said Kanhaiya Lal, a farmer from the area. The river, flanked by agricultural fields, has always been central to the rural economy of Sewapuri. A bridge is also under construction on the Varanasi-Bhadohi Highway over a revived stretch, signalling further integration of the river into local infrastructure. Even now, with summer at its peak, stretches of the river like those near Benipur still retain water. Locals are optimistic that with sustained effort and adequate rainfall, the Matuka can once again become a perennial river. CDO Nagpal said, \u201cThis project is not just about a river. It\u2019s about resilience, community ownership, and sustainability. When people come together with a shared purpose, real change is possible.\""

            "text": "The National Commission for Women has strongly condemned the purported derogatory remarks made against Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, calling for respect for women in uniform. Though Commission chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar did not name anybody but her remarks come a day after Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah\u2019s purported remarks against Qureshi sparked widespread outrage. \u201cIt is extremely unfortunate that such statements are being made by some responsible persons which are derogatory and unacceptable towards women. This not only hurts the dignity of women in our society but is also an insult to the daughters of the nation who are playing an important role in the security of the country,\" she said on X. \u201cDear Colonel Sofiya Qureshi is a proud daughter of this nation, a sister of all country-loving Indians, who has served the country with courage and dedication,\" she said, adding the entire country is proud of brave women like her and that such derogatory statements should be \u201cstrongly condemned.\" The Congress shared a video in which Shah is purportedly heard making objectionable remarks, saying, \u201c\u2018Jinhone humari betiyon ke sindoor ujade the\u2026 humne unhiki behen bhej kar ke unki aisi ki taisi karwayi (those who wiped sindoor (vermilion) off our daughters\u2019 forehead\u2026 we sent their sister to teach them a lesson)\u2019.\" Shah later said, \u201cIf my words have hurt society and religion, then I am ready to apologise ten times.\" Colonel Qureshi was part of the tri-services team that conducted press briefings on Operation Sindoor alongside Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh. The Indian military response came after terrorists carried out a brutal attack in Pahalgam that left 26 people dead Rahatkar also pointed to the recent CBSE results where girls have outperformed boys in several categories, stating that it is more important than ever to foster a respectful attitude towards women. Calling for dignity in public discourse, she urged everyone to adopt respectful language and behaviour towards women. \u201cUnderestimating the participation and contribution of women is not only unacceptable but also an obstacle to the development of the country,\" she added.

            "text": "Wholesale price inflation dropped to 0.85 per cent in April as prices of food articles, manufactured products, and fuel eased, government data showed on Wednesday. WPI-based inflation was 2.05 per cent in March. It was 1.19 per cent in April last year. \" Positive rate of inflation in April, 2025 is primarily due to an increase in prices of manufacture of food products, other manufacturing, chemicals and chemical products, manufacture of other transport equipment and manufacture of machinery and equipment, etc,\" the industry ministry said in a statement. As per the WPI (Wholesale price index ) data, food articles saw a deflation of 0.86 per cent in April from an inflation of 1.57 per cent in March, with vegetables seeing a sharp drop. Deflation in vegetables was 18.26 per cent during April compared to deflation of 15.88 per cent in March. In onion, inflation eased to 0.20 per cent in April, as against 26.65 per cent in March. Manufactured products, however, saw inflation at 2.62 per cent in April, compared to 3.07 per cent in March. Fuel and power too saw a deflation of 2.18 per cent in April, compared to 0.20 per cent in March. The RBI mainly takes into account retail inflation while formulating monetary policy. Data released on Tuesday showed, retail inflation eased to 3.16 per cent in April mainly due subdued prices of vegetables, fruits, pulses, and other protein-rich items. This is the lowest level of inflation since July 2019. Easing of inflation would create enough room for the Reserve Bank to go in for another round of rate cut in the June monetary policy review. In April, the RBI cut the benchmark policy rate by 0.25 per cent to 6 per cent. This is the second cut during the year to stimulate the economy, facing the threat of US reciprocal tariffs. The RBI sees retail inflation averaging 4 per cent in the current fiscal from the previous estimate of 4.2 per cent.

            "text": "After facing widespread criticism for his indecent remarks on Indian Army Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, senior BJP leader from Madhya Pradesh, Vijay Shah, issued an apology on Tuesday. Shah, who also serves as the state\u2019s Tribal Welfare Minister, had equated Colonel Qureshi\u2019s role in the military with a communal and gendered slur during a public speech, drawing sharp condemnation from opposition parties and military veterans. \u201cSister Sofiya has brought glory to India by rising above caste and religion. She is more respected than our own sister. I salute her for her service to the nation. We cannot even think of insulting her in our dreams. Still, if my words have hurt society and religion, then I am ready to apologise ten times,\" he said. Later the same night, Shah shared another apology via a video statement on his X account. \u201cI, Vijay Shah, am not only deeply ashamed and saddened but also seek forgiveness from the bottom of my heart for my recent statement that has hurt the sentiments of every community,\" he said in the video. He added, \u201cOur country\u2019s sister, Sofia Qureshi ji, has risen above caste and community while fulfilling her national duty and has done her work.\" Shah\u2019s comments have been heavily criticised by the Congress, which has demanded his immediate removal from the state cabinet. However, Shah has since tried to defuse the situation by issuing multiple apologies. A massive row was triggered after Shah drew a connection between the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, which left 26 people dead, and Operation Sindoor. Referring to Col Qureshi, the minister claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent \u201ca sister from their (the terrorists\u2019) community\" in an Indian Air Force aircraft to \u201cstrip them of their pride\" and \u201cteach them a lesson.\" \u201cThose people (terrorists) who had wiped out the sindoor of our sisters in the Pahalgam terror attack\u2026We avenged these \u2018kate-pite\u2019 people by sending their sister to destroy them,\" he said, adding, \u201cThey (terrorists) killed our Hindu brothers by making them remove their clothes. PM Modi ji responded by sending their (terrorists\u2019) sister in an Army plane to strike them in their houses.\" A video of the minister went viral on social media, drawing widespread criticism. Col Qureshi, alongside Wing Commander Vyomika Singh and Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, has been the face of official press briefings detailing Operation Sindoor. Slamming Shah for his remarks, the Congress party termed his comments as \u201cderogatory, communal and shameful.\" Party president Mallikarjun Kharge also issued a statement and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to sack him immediately. \u201cA minister of the BJP government of Madhya Pradesh has made a very derogatory, shameful and cheap remark about our brave daughter Colonel Sofia Qureshi. The terrorists of Pahalgam wanted to divide the country, but the country was united during the entire \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019 to give a befitting reply to the terrorists,\" Kharge wrote in a post on X."

            "text": "It is almost a D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu moment for India\u2019s tourism sector. Remember January 2024, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s casual walk on the white beach and dives into the blue water of Lakshadweep\u2014a tropical archipelago of 36 atolls and coral reefs in the Lakshadweep Sea, off the coast of Kerala\u2014made leaders of Maldives break into a knee-jerk reaction, resorting to even racial slurs against Indians? Indians called for Maldives\u2019 boycott and the rest, they say, is history. Platforms like EaseMyTrip de-platformed flights and accommodations of Maldives and there was a name-and-shame campaign online for anyone who chose to still visit Maldives. Cancellations spiralled. In a tourist spot where Indians constitute a major market, with over 2.91 lakh and 2.41 lakh Indian tourist arrivals in 2021 and 2022 during the peak of Covid-19, Maldives got a rude shock. It took a lot of backchannel cajoling at the highest level for India to finally consider going back to business as normal. But, in between, Maldives\u2019 economy sunk. The reason for the prelude is that the world may very well experience a similar moment\u2014This time in Turkey. Turkey chose to side with Pakistan and supply it with arms and ammunition in its conflict with India, back-stabbing India which extended help after the recent earthquake. Like Turkey, the new government in Maldives led by Muizzu too was earlier perceived to be against India\u2019s national interest and courting China. Indians lost no time in asking for a complete boycott of Turkey and Azerbaijan\u2014the two countries that extended their support to Pakistan. But since the central Asian nation is yet not that popular as Turkey is, \u2018Boycott Turkey\u2019 started to trend nationally. Unlike in Maldives, Turkey touched a raw nerve\u2014Pakistan. So, senior Indian politicians, including opposition faces who wouldn\u2019t leave a chance to corner PM Narendra Modi, jumped in to attack Turkey. Former Union minister and Congress leader Rajeev Shukla asked to \u201cimmediately stop\" Indians\u2019 destination weddings in Turkey. Meanwhile, Shiv Sena (Uddhav) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi called vacationing in Turkey \u201cblood money\". In 2023, nearly 2.75 lakh Indian tourists visited Turkey, and the number rose by over 20 per cent to 3.25 lakh in 2024. Platforms like Ixigo & EaseMyTrip pulled the plug on Turkey bookings. The ire is not just restricted to tourism, but slowly turning to produce as well. Turkish apples have suddenly vanished from markets after Indian traders switched their loyalties to Iran, Washington, and New Zealand to cater to those who prefer international qualities. \u201cWe used to sell 1,000 boxes of apples for retailers previously. But that has rapidly decreased. We were wondering why. When we asked the retailers, they said the customers were not buying Turkish apples anymore,\" said an apple wholesaler. For the love of our nation, we stand united. pic.twitter.com/GqKKzQ4as9\u2014 ixigo (@ixigo) May 10, 2025 Government sources say Turkey needs India more\u2014for pulses, oil seeds, steel\u2014than the other way around. India had planned to increase trade with Turkey up to $20 Billion. However, with changed realities, sources in the government suggest that India will cut trade ties with Turkey as it cannot negotiate with anyone who supports a terror state. \u201cTurkey has blood on its hands,\" said the source, adding that it is up to people to decide if they want to visit it for travel. \u201cThere is no advisory from the government to tour operators. We leave it to them. What we gather, most travel platforms have seen a fall in bookings to that sector.\" Mohamed Muizzu must be reliving his past seeing the boycott call now faced by Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.

            "text": "With US President Donald Trump reiterating his claims of brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, the Congress on Wednesday asked what do the \u201ctypically loquacious\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar have to say about this revelation and did they \u201cmortgage\" India\u2019s security interests in the face of US \u201cpressure\". Speaking in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, Trump once again claimed his administration \u201csuccessfully brokered a historic ceasefire\" to stop the escalating violence between India and Pakistan. Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh said, \u201cA few days ago we learnt of the ceasefire with Pakistan from the President of the United States. Now, at a public event in Saudi Arabia yesterday, the President reveals that he may have coerced and blackmailed India into this ceasefire using the carrot-and-stick of sanctions and trade deals.\" \u201cWhat do the typically loquacious PM and EAM have to say about this revelation? Did they mortgage India\u2019s security interests in the face of US pressure?\" Ramesh said on X. \u201cAmeriki papa ne war rukwa di kya?\" he added. The Congress was taking a swipe at the BJP for an advertisement it had put out last year claiming that PM Modi had stopped the Russia-Ukraine war. The advertisement showed a female student stranded in a foreign country, who meets her parents outside the airport, and says \u201cMaine kaha tha na, kaisi bhi situation ho, Modi ji humein ghar le ayenge, War rukwa di papa aur phir hamari bus nikali papa (I had told you, whatever the situation, Modi will bring us home. He stopped the war..) Congress on Tuesday night had said Trump was not only hyphenating the two countries but also comparing Prime Minister Modi with his Pakistani counterpart Shehbaz Sharif. The Congress\u2019 media and publicity department head Pawan Khera shared the clip of Trump\u2019s latest comments during the event in Saudi Arabia. \u201cUS president says it again: \u2018I used trade to make a deal between them, and they agreed\u2019. Not only is Donald Trump hyphenating India with Pakistan, he is comparing Prime Minister Modi with Shehbaz Sharif,\" he said in the caption. In his remarks at the Saudi-US investment forum in Riyadh, Trump said, \u201cAs I said in my inaugural address, my greatest hope is to be a peacemaker and to be a unifier. I don\u2019t like war. We have the greatest military, by the way, in the history of the world.\" \u201cJust days ago, my administration successfully brokered a historic ceasefire to stop the escalating violence between India and Pakistan,\" claimed Trump, who is in Saudi Arabia on the first leg of his four-day trip to the Gulf region. \u201cAnd I used trade to a large extent to do it. And I said, \u2018Fellows, come on. Let\u2019s make a deal. Let\u2019s do some trading\u2019,\" Trump said to applause from the high-level audience, which included billionaire Elon Musk. \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s not trade nuclear missiles. Let\u2019s trade the things that you make so beautifully. And they both have very powerful leaders, very strong leaders, good leaders, smart leaders. And it all stopped. Hopefully, it\u2019ll remain that way, but it all stopped,\" Trump said. A day earlier, Trump had claimed that his administration stopped a \u201cnuclear conflict\" between India and Pakistan, telling the south Asian neighbours that America would do a \u201clot of trade\" with them if they ended hostilities. Trump had announced India and Pakistan agreed to a \u201cfull and immediate ceasefire\" and claimed that it happened after a long night of talks \u201cmediated by the United States\".

            "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a Cabinet Committee on Security meeting, his first after the ceasefire with Pakistan on May 10, at his residence in the national capital. The CCS meeting was followed by a Cabinet meeting. The meetings are expected to discuss the aftermath of the \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019, besides formulating a strategic response to Pakistan. India had launched Operation Sindoor on May 7 to avenge the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians. The Indian armed forces, with their precision airstrikes, took down over 100 terrorists, their headquarters, and their training camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Yesterday, the Prime Minister visited the Adampur airbase and met the air warriors. He also interacted with them and lauded them for their exemplary show of courage and skill in the success of Operation Sindoor. PM Modi also addressed them, hailing their valour and warning Pakistan against any future misadventure, while also making it clear that the Operation Sindoor is merely on a pause. He also called out Pakistan\u2019s nuclear bluff and said that such blackmail would no longer work with India. \u201cWhen our forces blow away the threat of Nuclear blackmail, then only one thing resonates from India \u2014 \u2018Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019. You have made every Indian proud; you have created history. I am here early morning to have your \u2018darshan\u2019. When the feet of heroes touch the ground, the ground becomes blessed.

            "text": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday voiced the need for a comprehensive performance audit to assess the functioning of judges, citing a growing number of complaints regarding the efficiency of High Court judges. A Bench comprising Justice Surya Kant and Justice NK Singh orally noted that while many judges demonstrate diligent work ethics, concerns have arisen about others who frequently take unnecessary breaks, prompting questions about their effective utilization of court time. \u201cThere are some judges who work very hard, but at the same time, there are judges who are unnecessarily taking coffee breaks; this break or that break. What is for lunch hour, etc. We are hearing a lot of complaints about the High Court judges. This is a larger issue which needs to be looked into. What is the performance of the High Court judges? How much we are spending and what is the output? It\u2019s high time we do a performance audit,\" the Court said as per Bar and Bench. The Supreme Court voiced its concern while hearing a plea from four life convicts belonging to Scheduled Tribe or Other Backward Classes communities. These individuals alleged that the Jharkhand High Court had failed to pronounce judgments on their criminal appeals for an extended period of two to three years after reserving them. The Court had previously sought information regarding the status of these long-pending cases. On May 5, the Supreme Court directed all High Courts to submit reports detailing cases where judgments remained pending despite the matters being reserved. Continuing its scrutiny, the Supreme Court reiterated the paramount importance of this issue, suggesting the potential issuance of guidelines to ensure the timely delivery of judgments. The Court emphasized that the matter directly impacts the fundamental principles of the criminal justice system. On May 9, Supreme Court took further steps which included a request for reports from High Courts specifying the dates of judgment pronouncement and their subsequent publication on court websites. \u201cIt seems that the issues noticed in the above mentioned orders would require and deeper analysis and mandatory guidelines by this Court, so that convicts or undertrials aren\u2019t compelled to lose faith in the justice delivery system and to avoid the petitions like one in present case,\" it noted."

            "title": "Trump\u2019s Pharma Shake-Up: Indian Generic Drug Makers Stay Calm But Cautious",
            "text": "As the United States steps up efforts to curb high-drug prices, Indian drug makers are closely monitoring the developments, but remain largely unaffected. On Monday, American President Donald Trump signed an executive order implementing a \u2018Most Favoured Nation\u2019 (MFN) policy for US prescription drugs. The order mandates that drug prices in the United States be aligned with the lowest prices paid by other developed nations, particularly those in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The move, Trump claims, aims to address the wide pricing disparity where Americans pay substantially more for medicines than patients in other high-income countries. While the intent is to make drugs more affordable for American patients, Indian experts believe the order is unlikely to affect India\u2019s generic pharmaceutical industry. India\u2019s generics sector plays a vital role globally as it accounts for 90 per cent of prescription volumes in the US, while contributing to only 13 per cent of its market value. Experts also point out that the focus of the executive order seems to be primarily on patented drugs, not generics. While many industry experts believe there is no significant threat for Indian drug makers, a few consider the move as \u201ca wakeup call\" for Indian pharma. According to Vishal Manchanda, a pharma analyst at financial services firm Systematix, \u201cThe focus of this executive order is clearly the patented drugs.\" Manchanda also raised doubts about the viability of the order itself. \u201cTaking a clue from what happened with the executive order that Trump issued on similar lines towards the end of his previous term, I think this one too may not see the light of day. The court had placed an injunction on the previous Trump executive order mandating MFN-linked pricing.\" Sharing a similar assessment, Ravi Udaya Bhaskar, former Director-General of the commerce ministry\u2019s Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India (Pharmexcil), said, \u201cIndia is predominantly a generics player, and our prices are very competitive. I don\u2019t think this will have any impact on Indian generics. The President may be focusing more on patented medicines.\" He further added, \u201cThe US imports drugs worth $200 billion from various countries, mainly from Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, and others. India\u2019s share is about $10 billion, or 5 per cent of the total US drug imports. It\u2019s good that he is trying to reduce medicine prices for Americans. However, we need to watch closely, as his policies change frequently, and we also need to keep an eye on any tariffs on India once the 90-day period ends.\" India\u2019s domestic drug makers, represented by the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA)\u2014which includes companies like Sun Pharma, Glenmark, Lupin, and Cipla\u2014also believe that the impact on the generics sector will be minimal. In a statement, Sudarshan Jain, Secretary General of IPA, said, \u201cThe generics industry is unlikely to be impacted, as it operates on razor-thin margins.\" He explained that the order attempts to balance innovation, access, and overall healthcare costs. \u201cThe executive order issued by the US government seeks to balance innovation, access and overall healthcare costs. The order emphasises that the cost of the innovation should be shared equitably among all stakeholders. Innovator companies are expected to be affected, with a 30-day window to align their US prices with Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) pricing.\" Jain reiterated the crucial role of generics in the American market: \u201cIn the US, the generics industry represents 90 per cent of prescription volumes while accounting for only 13 per cent of the market value. The generics industry plays a pivotal role in ensuring medicines remain affordable and accessible. Further details on implementation mechanisms will bring more clarity.\" However, a different perspective comes from the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a New Delhi-based think tank. While the policy may bring down prices in the US in the short term, GTRI believes it could trigger global consequences. Ajay Srivastava, founder of GTRI and a former Indian Trade Service officer, sees this as a critical moment for Indian pharmaceutical policy. \u201cTrump\u2019s MFN pricing policy should be a wake-up call,\" he said. Srivastava cautioned that price controls in the West could push pharmaceutical multinationals to recover costs by targeting lower-cost markets like India. \u201cAs pharmaceutical companies face tighter price controls in the West, they will redouble their efforts to raise prices in markets like India. The battleground is no longer just legal\u2014it has moved to trade negotiations. India must respond with strategic clarity and unyielding resolve.\" He added, \u201cThe world depends on India\u2019s generics. Preserving this model is not only in India\u2019s interest, but it is also a moral and global necessity.\" donald trumpnews18 specialspharmaceuticalUnited states"

            "text": "Retired United States Army officer John W Spencer on Wednesday termed India\u2019s \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019 \u201ca decisive victory in modern warfare\" and said that the country has not yet declared the operation complete. He also said the new India hits back, while the India back in 2008 absorbed attacks and waited. In a lengthy X post, Spencer, who is also a researcher of urban warfare and an author, said India achieved a \u201cmassive victory\" in its operation against Pakistan. \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019 met and exceeded its strategic aims through decisive powers and a symbolic force, he said. \u201cIndia has not declared Operation Sindoor completely over. What exists now is a sensitive halt in operations\u2014some may call it a ceasefire, but military leaders have deliberately avoided that word. From a warfighting perspective, this is not merely a pause; it is a strategic hold following a rare and unambiguous military victory,\" Spencer wrote on his timeline on X. \u201cAfter just four days of calibrated military action, it is objectively conclusive: India achieved a massive victory.\" \u201cOperation Sindoor met and exceeded its strategic aims\u2014destroying terrorist infrastructure, demonstrating military superiority, restoring deterrence, and unveiling a new national security doctrine. This was not symbolic force. It was decisive power, clearly applied,\" he wrote. Referencing the Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed the lives of 26 innocent tourists on April 22, Spencer mentioned that the responsibility of the attack was claimed by The Resistance Front (TRF), an offshoot of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). \u201cIndia was attacked. On April 22, 2025, 26 Indian civilians, mostly Hindu tourists, were massacred in Pahalgam, Jammu & Kashmir. The Resistance Front (TRF), an offshoot of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), claimed responsibility. As has been the case for decades, the group is backed by Pakistan\u2019s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI),\" Spencer wrote on X. \u201cBut unlike previous attacks, this time India didn\u2019t wait. It didn\u2019t appeal for international mediation or issue a diplomatic demarche. It launched warplanes. On May 7, India initiated Operation Sindoor, a swift and precisely calibrated military campaign. The Indian Air Force struck nine terrorist infrastructure targets inside Pakistan, including headquarters and operational hubs for Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba. The message was clear: terror attacks launched from Pakistani soil will now be treated as acts of war,\" he added. Spencer also hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and mentioned how he made firm that India would not tolerate any nuclear blackmail. \u201cPrime Minister Narendra Modi made the new doctrine unmistakable: \u201cIndia will not tolerate any nuclear blackmail. India will strike precisely and decisively at the terrorist hideouts developing under the cover of nuclear blackmail.\" More than a retaliation, this was the unveiling of a strategic doctrine. As Modi said, \u201cTerror and talks can\u2019t go together. Water and blood can\u2019t flow together.\",\" he wrote. Spencer also wrote down how India\u2019s \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019 was executed in phases. \u201cOperation Sindoor was executed in deliberate phases This wasn\u2019t just tactical success. It was doctrinal execution under live fire.\" Also underlining the impacts of the \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019, Spencer wrote, Terror attacks from Pakistani soil will now be met with military force. That\u2019s not a threat. It\u2019s precedent. India showcased its ability to strike any target in Pakistan at will\u2014terror sites, drone coordination hubs, even airbases. Meanwhile, Pakistan was unable to penetrate a single defended area inside India. That is not parity. That is overwhelming superiority. And that is how real deterrence is established. India retaliated forcefully but stopped short of full war. The controlled escalation sent a clear deterrent signal: India will respond, and it controls the pace. Spencer, in his X post, also highlighted that the situation was dealt with by India single-handedly, without seeking international mediation. \u201cIndia handled this crisis without seeking international mediation. It enforced doctrine on sovereign terms, using sovereign means. Operation Sindoor was not about occupation or regime change. It was limited war executed for specific objectives. Critics who argue India should have gone further miss the point. Strategic success isn\u2019t about the scale of destruction\u2014it\u2019s about achieving the desired political effect,\" he wrote. \u201cIndia was not fighting for vengeance. It was fighting for deterrence. And it worked. India\u2019s restraint is not weakness\u2014it is maturity. It imposed costs, redefined thresholds, and retained escalation dominance. India didn\u2019t just respond to an attack. It changed the strategic equation,\" Spencer mentioned. \u201cIn an age where many modern wars spiral into open-ended occupations or political confusion, Operation Sindoor stands apart. This was a demonstration of disciplined military strategy: clear goals, aligned ways and means, and adaptive execution in the face of unpredictable escalation. India absorbed a blow, defined its objective, and achieved it\u2014all within a contained timeframe.\" \u201cThe use of force in Operation Sindoor was overwhelming yet controlled\u2014precise, decisive, and without hesitation. That kind of clarity is rare in modern war. In an era defined by \u201cforever wars\" and cycles of violence without strategic direction, Sindoor stands apart. It offers a model of limited war with clearly defined ends, matched ways and means, and a state that never relinquished the initiative.\" Comparing the India back in 2008 \u2013 during the UPA\u2019s regime, and the present India, Spencer wrote, \u201cThe India of 2008 absorbed attacks and waited. This India hits back\u2014immediately, precisely, and with clarity.\" \u201cModi\u2019s doctrine, India\u2019s advancing domestic defense industry, and the professionalism of its armed forces all signal a country no longer preparing for the last war. It is preparing for the next one. The halt in operations is not the end of Operation Sindoor. It is a pause. India holds the initiative. If provoked again, it will strike again,\" he wrote. \u201cThis is deterrence restored. This is a new doctrine revealed. And it should be studied by all nations confronting the scourge of state-sponsored terrorism. Operation Sindoor was a modern war\u2014fought under the shadow of nuclear escalation, with global attention, and within a limited objective framework. And by every measure that matters, it was a strategic success\u2014and a decisive Indian victory,\" his X post read. \u201cAfter just four days of calibrated military action, it is objectively conclusive: India achieved a massive victory.

            "title": "'India\u2019s Top-Selling Insulin Isn\u2019t Going Away, 10% Users To Be Impacted': Novo Nordisk India MD",
            "text": "In a big relief for Indian patients, Denmark-based Novo Nordisk said it is not discontinuing India\u2019s largest-selling insulin brand, Human Mixtard. In recent weeks, concerns had been growing among diabetes patients over reports of a possible discontinuation of Human Mixtard. However, the largest-selling insulin brand will remain available in vials and not pens. In an interview, Vikrant Shrotriya, Managing Director, Novo Nordisk India, told News18, \u201cNovo Nordisk India confirms that it is not discontinuing Human Mixtard in India and will continue to supply it in vial presentation along with other human insulins, including Human Actrapid and Human Insulatard.\" The company\u2019s decision aligns with its global strategy. Globally, the Danish drug-maker is gradually winding up production of human insulin pens as it focuses on ramping up manufacturing of its latest and popular obesity or diabetes injections, including the blockbuster drug, Ozempic. \u201cIn India, we will be phasing out human insulin in Penfill and FlexPen gradually by the end of this year. However, we continue to remain a very strong player with the largest insulin formulation offerings in India in all three generations, including human insulin, modern insulin and new generation insulin.\" Shrotriya explained that as part of the global portfolio consolidation, Novo Nordisk has decided to phase out certain insulin products or devices, \u201cwhich reflects our ongoing efforts to continually improve our existing product offerings and to ensure that maximum patients have access to the most effective and innovative treatments available, globally\". \u201cThis will create space needed in our global manufacturing network, rationalise and make it sustainable in the long run to bring efficiency in Novo Nordisk product offerings.\" Despite the price control, according to Pharmarack data, Mixtard was the eleventh most-selling brand in India in April, with its moving annual turnover (MAT) standing at Rs 766 crore. The second-largest insulin brand also comes from Novo Nordisk\u2019s portfolio, Ryzodeg, with a MAT of Rs 593 crore, followed by Sanofi\u2019s Lantus. In high-income countries or even in India, for those who can afford it, most people with diabetes now rely on modern insulin, as this kind of product offers more precise blood sugar control and greater flexibility in dosing. However, in low- and middle-income countries or for people who want cheaper options, human insulin remains the more widely used option. It\u2019s significantly cheaper and easier to produce. However, it doesn\u2019t always provide the same level of control or convenience which can be achieved by the latest insulin options. The company believes that \u201cof the overall patients on insulin in India, only 10 per cent are impacted,\" with this decision to phase out penfill and flexpen versions. \u201cThey will have the choice of transitioning to modern and new generation insulin or continue human insulin through vials or other treatment options available in the market, based on the recommendation from their physician,\" Shrotriya said, adding that \u201cthe remaining 90 per cent of patients using insulin remain unimpacted\". \u201cWe continue our unwavering commitment towards people with diabetes by continuing to serve every \u2018one in two\u2019 patients in India who require insulin,\" he said. \u201cAccordingly, we are doing everything we can to liaise early with health authorities, support healthcare professionals, trade partners and patients in the transition to other treatment options.\" Currently, Novo Nordisk claims that it is the only company in India offering three generations of insulins to patients living with diabetes. On being asked if this withdrawal will affect their overall insulin portfolio and research and development plans in India, Shrotriya explained that \u201cNovo Nordisk India contributes around 10 per cent to more than 40 global trials across therapy areas\". \u201cWe continue to invest in R&D to bring more innovations for the benefit of people living with serious chronic diseases, including improved insulins such as glucose-sensitive insulin, beta-cell replacement therapies and once-weekly insulin therapy.\" Watch India Pakistan Breaking News on CNN-News18.

            "text": "Born just five minutes apart on April 25, 2014, twelve-year-old twins Urba Fatima and Zain Ali from the Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir shared an inseparable bond. From their earliest days, the brother and sister were constant companions, navigating life side-by-side. Tragically, in the early hours of May 7, this close connection extended even to their deaths, as they were killed within moments of each other by cross-border shelling from Pakistan. \u201cThey died within minutes of each other,\" their maternal uncle, Adil Pathan, recounted to The Indian Express. Urba and Zain were among the 27 fatalities, including security personnel, resulting from the intense shelling in Jammu and Kashmir. Their father, Rameez, a teacher, sustained grave injuries in the same incident. The deadly shelling occurred against a backdrop of heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, following a terror attack that claimed 26 lives. On the same day as the twins\u2019 deaths, May 7, India launched retaliatory strikes targeting terrorist sites in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Pakistan. Originally hailing from Kalai village, about 10 km from Poonch town, the twelve-year-old twins Urba and Zain had recently relocated with their parents, Rameez (47) and Ursha Khan (in her 40s), to a rented house in Poonch just two months prior, seeking better educational opportunities at Christ School where they were in Class 4 and had recently celebrated their birthday, according to their uncle Adil. Adil became the first to respond to the tragedy. On the morning of May 7, a frantic call from the twins reached him, pleading for rescue from the escalating shelling. He arrived at their rented accommodation around 6:30 am amidst heavy fire. To expedite their escape, he called out to Ursha and her family, urging them to come outside immediately. The twins and their father, Rameez, were the first to emerge, Adil recounted. It was at that moment that a shell struck nearby, instantly killing Urba and Zain and severely injuring Rameez. Amidst the chaos of people fleeing for safety, Adil managed to get all three into his vehicle and rushed them to the Poonch district hospital, where the young twins were tragically declared dead.

The jawan was returned to India via the Attari-Wagah border at around 10.30 am. #WATCH | Punjab: First visuals from Attari Border in Amritsar as BSF jawan Purnam Kumar Shaw returns to India.Constable Purnam Kumar Shaw had inadvertently crossed over to Pakistan territory, while on operational duty in area of Ferozepur sector on 23rd April 2025 and detained\u2026 pic.twitter.com/gTXNq3IT9O The development comes days after India and Pakistan reached an \u201cunderstanding\" to halt military operations against each other on May 10 after the latter escalated the situation on the border following India\u2019s Operation Sindoor against terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on May 7. Celebrations erupted in the family as the news of the jawan\u2019s return reached his native place. His father, Bholanath Shaw, thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and said that he wants him to work for the country and return to his duty at the soonest. \u201cI want to thank the Prime Minister, all Ministers, and also the Chief Minister of Bengal, Mamata Banerjee. We are happy that he is back in India. We want to see him first. I want him to work for the country only. He will again go back to protect our country,\" he said. Sahu\u2019s wife, Rajni, had earlier visited Ferojpur, where he was posted, and met senior BSF officials who assured her of making all efforts to bring him back to India. The BSF officials were given the same reply from Pakistan every time: \u201cWe are waiting for directions from the higher-ups\". However, after the May 10 \u201cunderstanding\", Sahu was released from Pakistani custody as he walked freely past the Joint Check Post Attari, Amritsar. \u201cToday BSF Jawan Purnam Kumar Shaw, who had been in the custody of Pakistan Rangers since 23 April 2025, was handed over to India at about 1030 hours through the Joint Check Post Attari, Amritsar. The handover was conducted peacefully and in accordance with established protocols,\" officials said. However, in this instance, the detention of the BSF jawan took place at a time when tensions between India and Pakistan were on the rise following the Pahalgam terror attack, which killed 26 people, including a Nepali national. To avenge the massacre, Indian armed forces launched Operation Sindoor on May 7 and took down 9 terrorist camps in Pakistan and PoK without crossing the Line of Control or International Border.

            "text": "A recent ruling by the Delhi High Court has clarified that a husband\u2019s extramarital affair, by itself, does not amount to \u2018cruelty\u2019 unless it can be proven that the relationship was intended to cause mental harassment to the wife. The court\u2019s observation came while granting bail to a man whose wife died by suicide in her in-laws\u2019 house in March 2024, less than five years into their marriage. The woman\u2019s parents had accused the husband of dowry harassment, physical abuse, and having an extramarital relationship. He was subsequently booked under sections 498A (cruelty), 304B (dowry death), and 306 (abetment to suicide) of the law and was taken into custody. Granting him bail on Tuesday, Justice Sanjeev Narula noted, \u201cEven if we assume that there was an affair, it does not in itself fall under the category of cruelty or provocation to suicide, unless it is proved that the purpose of this relationship was to deliberately torture the wife mentally.\" The court also noted that the affair could not be linked to dowry death unless it was proven that the wife was pressured to bring dowry due to the affair or was mentally tortured because of it. The family of the deceased claimed that the husband had a relationship with a colleague and beat the wife when she objected. They also alleged that she was pressured to bring money from her parents to pay for the car\u2019s EMI. However, the court found these claims weak as the wife had never filed a complaint about them with any police station or forum. While the court acknowledged the seriousness of the allegations, it stated that the absence of any formal complaint during the woman\u2019s lifetime diminished the case\u2019s severity. Additionally, the court also said that the accused had already been in jail since March, the chargesheet had been filed and the trial was not expected to begin soon. With no risk of evidence tampering, the court concluded that further detention was not justified. Consequently, the husband was released on a personal bond of Rs 50,000 with two bail conditions. abetment to suicideChargesheetcolleaguecrueltydelhi high courtdowry deathdowry harassmentextramarital affairPhysical abuse"

The decision comes in the wake of a tigress\u2019s death at Shaheed Ashfaqulla Zoological Park in Gorakhpur on May 6, which later tested positive for the virus. Dr Anil Kumar Patel, Director of Etawah Safari Park, announced on Tuesday that the closure is a precautionary measure to protect wildlife and prevent any potential spread of infection. The tigress\u2019s sample had been sent to a laboratory in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, where it tested positive for avian influenza. In light of the incident, a lion at Etawah Safari Park, known as the Pataudi lion, was transferred to Kanpur Zoo due to serious illness, raising further concerns. To contain the outbreak and safeguard animals, the park management has issued a strict set of biosafety protocols. Regional Forest Officer of Etawah will deploy three inspection teams to monitor the park premises daily, especially for any cases of deceased wild or free-ranging birds. These teams will report any such findings immediately, and regular sanitisation of the Safari Park will be ensured. Deputy Director Dr Vinay Kumar Singh has stressed that strict compliance with all protocols is mandatory and warned that any negligence will be dealt with seriously. The park\u2019s closure underscores growing concerns over the spread of avian flu among India\u2019s wildlife sanctuaries and zoological parks."

            "text": "Days after EaseMyTrip announced suspending all flight and hotel bookings for Turkey and Azerbaijan amid its call to side with Pakistan amid tensions, the co-founder of the online travel platform, Prashant Pitti while talking to CNN-News18, informed that in recent days, the platform witnessed massive travel cancellations for the two countries. \u201cFor Turkey, we have seen cancellations of about 22 percent, and for Azerbaijan, it is above 30 percent. Last year, 3.8 lakh people travelled to either Azerbaijan or Turkey from India,\" the co-founder of EaseMyTrip said. Further informing about the loss to Turkey and Azerbaijan with Indians cancelling their visits, Pitti informed that if you take a modest 60,000-70,000 rupees per passenger spent, it equates to somewhere around 2,500 to 3,000 crores, which was spent by Indians in these countries. \u201cNow, this money will probably come back to us in the form of these countries choosing to give their arsenals, their weaponry to Pakistan and hitting back on them, which is why it is important for us Indians to know where to spend our money,\" EaseMyTrip\u2019s Prashant Pitti said while taking a firm stand against the countries supplying weapons to Pakistan. In addition to EaseMyTrip, Ixigo CEO Aloke Bajpai also on Saturday announced that the platform is suspending all flight and hotel bookings for Turkey, China and Azerbaijan. \u201cEnough is Enough! Blood and Bookings won\u2019t flow together,\" he said. India is taking a firm stand against the countries siding with Pakistan amid rising tensions between India and Pakistan following the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack. Turkey and Azerbaijan are facing a massive boycott in the country, with prominent Indian businesses and even politicians voicing support. This came after Turkey not only sided with Pakistan, while the rest of the world was condemning the heinous terror attack in J&K\u2019s Pahalgam, but Turkish Songar drones were also used by the Pakistan Army to target India\u2019s military bases and civilian infrastructure.

            "text": "Parts of West Bengal experienced heavy rain and thunderstorms on Wednesday morning, uprooting trees and causing power outages at several places. Social media videos also showed Bengaluru received very heavy rain on Tuesday, with knee-deep waterlogging witnessed at many places. On Tuesday, the India Meteorological Department had said the southwest monsoon has advanced into parts of the south Bay of Bengal, south Andaman Sea, Nicobar Islands and some areas of the north Andaman Sea. The weather office also said that conditions are favourable for the monsoon to advance further into more parts of the south Arabian Sea, Maldives and Comorin area, more areas of the south Bay of Bengal, the entire Andaman and Nicobar Islands, remaining parts of the Andaman Sea, and parts of the central Bay of Bengal over the next three to four days. The primary rain-bearing system is likely to reach Kerala on May 27, earlier than the usual date of June 1, according to the weather department. According to some reports, regional weather experts have noted the presence of an upper air cyclonic circulation over the Andaman Sea, which may lead to the formation of a low-pressure system between May 16 and 22. Forecasters have also suggested that the system could strengthen into a cyclone named \u2018Shakti\u2019 in between May 23 and 28. \u201cAn upper air cyclonic circulation lay over Andaman Sea between 1.5 km and 7.6 km above mean sea level, tilting south-westwards with height at 0300 UTC of today, 13th May, 2025,\" the IMD stated in a press release on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the weather department has issued a yellow alert in the districts of Karnataka, warning residents to expect more pre-monsoon showers until May 16. The weather forecast in Kolkata indicated a partly cloudy sky for Wednesday, with chances of thunderstorms and light to moderate rain. Watch India Pakistan Breaking News on CNN-News18.

While Pakistan kept denying its air bases were hit, an X handle named Alpha Defence shared these images from Kawa Space to expose Pakistan\u2019s lies. Ultimately, India knew the truth. \u201cThese images back India\u2019s claims and show the real impact of our nation\u2019s operations. In the fog of conflict, proof is power \u2014 and we found it,\" Kris Nair, founder and CEO, told CNN-News18 in an interview. He says Kawa Space is a global intelligence and defence space company which he started in 2019.

We shared our findings in open domain with a few specialist magazines, including Alpha Defence,\" Nair told CNN-News18. These satellite images were widely cited to expose Pakistan and prove the dominance of India\u2019s big attack on a nuclear-powered Pakistan. Nair says he is building tools for deterrence\u2014foundation models that go beyond describing adversaries. \u201cThey visualise battlefields, decode doctrines, and absorb millions of pixels in seconds. Naturally, our products are built for national security teams. We attract a certain kind of professionals\u2014those who see defence not as noise, but as a necessity,\" Nair said. When asked if his start-up has a nationalistic fervour, Nair said: \u201cIndia is not just borders and slogans. It is rhythm, memory, and soul. And we believe: The sword, when drawn for the right reasons, is not violence\u2014it is reverence in motion.\" He chose not to comment on the issue if India hit the Kirana Hills too where Pakistan\u2019s nuclear facilities are believed to be located. Nair had shared a satellite image of the Kirana Hills on which Air Force made a cryptic remark.

He says he is building critical space infrastructure for the Nation States. He earlier led India\u2019s first private space mission ExseedSat01 on SpaceX SSO and won a historic contract from ISRO for his team. The satellite imagery that Nair\u2019s firm provided of the damage to the Pakistani air bases has proved the military superiority of India and how India used its missiles to target these military facilities in key centers like Rawalpindi, Islamabad, and Karachi.

            "text": "Eased tensions along the India-Pakistan border have prompted a recalibration within India\u2019s internal security apparatus in Jammu and Kashmir. After a week of heightened alert, official sources confirm that the anticipated restructuring of forces\u2014originally planned to counter a potential escalation\u2014has been shelved. Security personnel who were urgently mobilised in response to the crisis are now being asked to return to their original duties and resume pending leaves. A recent communication from a senior official of a Central Armed Police Force (CAPF) responsible for Jammu & Kashmir directed that all troops who were recalled from leave during the tense period may now be permitted to resume their leave, if any days remain. \u201cWith reference to the subject matter, you are informed that during the unforeseen situation in the country, the personnel of the force who were on leave and were recalled can be sent back on leave if any days are left,\" the communication reads. This directive marks a clear shift in operational posture. Earlier, the force had imposed a blanket cancellation of all leaves amid the uncertainty. Troops who were being positioned for immediate deployment to Jammu & Kashmir are now being instructed to remain at their current stations until further orders. A senior official told News18 that the armed forces remain vigilant at the border, while a sufficient number of CAPF personnel are deployed internally to maintain law and order in J&K. \u201cThe troops can be redeployed at very short notice if needed,\" the official added. Officials note that the previously planned restructuring of units\u2014intended to optimise border response\u2014has been deemed unnecessary for the time being. Forces across J&K will continue in their current roles and locations, signalling a return to routine readiness rather than an escalated stance. Earlier, amid heightened tensions, the top brass had been considering strategic security adjustments, including the movement of additional CRPF personnel to assist the Jammu and Kashmir Police in maintaining law and order across key areas.

Speaking exclusively to CNN-News18, Cooper, on a question of how weak the Pakistanis have been after India\u2019s \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019, said, \u201cThis is a clear-cut victory. The moment the Indian Air Force started striking nuclear weapon storage facilities in Pakistan, it was absolutely clear that Pakistan is, not entirely defenceless, but largely unable to defend itself from Indian strikes.\" Cooper also hailed the Indian government for being \u201ccautious enough\" not to brag too much about its strikes against Pakistan. \u201cThe government in India, New Delhi, and top brass of the armed forces are cautious enough not to brag too much about this, even to deny it, but we have seen videos showing strikes on one of the\u2026 no actually, two defence nuclear weapons storage facilities in Pakistan. This is speaking such a clear language, I cannot emphasise this enough, do not play with nuclear facilities, nobody is doing that, and especially not, rather conservative and cautious Indian generals, they are not going to shoot all over the place.\" \u201cThis caution means they are absolutely sure Pakistan can\u2019t keep back, Pakistan has no means to pull these weapons out and put them on missiles or aircraft and shoot them at India,\" Cooper said. On a question of Pakistan initiating the talks for a ceasefire, Cooper said, \u201cPakistan is receiving blow after blow, but India is receiving no blow at all, and in grand total, when you consider the scope of the outcome, it does not matter whether India has lost five or 50 combat aircraft.\" \u201cImportant is that Pakistan was at the receiving end of Indian airstrikes and couldn\u2019t do anything against them,\" he said. #IndiaPakistan | Indian government is cautious enough to not brag too much, but we have seen IAF striking Pak\u2019s nuclear storage facility: Tom Cooper, Air Military Historian #IndiaPakistanConflict #OperationSindoor #TheHardFacts | @RShivshankar pic.twitter.com/0ZLU7H2mHN\u2014 News18 (@CNNnews18) May 13, 2025 The remarks by Cooper came days after India and Pakistan announced halting of military action from both sides, after the Indian DGMO was approached by his Pakistani counterpart for the same.

            "text": "The Ministry of External Affairs on Wednesday slammed China for attempting to rename places in Arunachal Pradesh and said that creative naming will not alter the undeniable reality that the state is an \u201cintegral and inalienable part of India\". Responding to a media query, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, \u201cWe have noticed that China has persisted with its vain and preposterous attempts to name places in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh. Consistent with our principled position.\" \u201cWe reject such attempts categorically. Creative naming will not alter the undeniable reality that Arunachal Pradesh was, is, and will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India,\" he added. India\u2019s response came in view of China\u2019s continuing efforts to assert claims over the north-eastern Indian state. Last year in April, China rechristened 30 locations in Arunachal Pradesh with Chinese and Tibetan names. Meanwhile, India has stayed firm in its rejection of China\u2019s attempt to claim territories in Arunachal Pradesh and asserted that the state is an integral part of India. Commenting on the issue, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Wednesday said that the names of some places in Zangnan have been standardised by the Chinese government, while claiming that the entire area falls within the scope of China\u2019s sovereignty. Beijing in the past had released four lists attempting to rename several places in Arunachal Pradesh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). In 2017, the country released the initial list of \u2018standardised\u2019 names for six locations in the Indian territory. This was succeeded by a second list comprising 15 places in 2021, with another list featuring names for 11 additional places released in 2023. Then, a list of 30 places was released in April 2024.

EAM Jaishankar already has Z-category security, in which a team of 33 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) commandos is deployed for his protection 24/7. The move comes amid India-Pakistan tensions, which spiralled into a short military conflict after Pakistan chose to strike Indian civilian and military targets using drones and missiles in response to India\u2019s precision strikes against terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on May 7. An \u201cunderstanding\" was reached on May 10 after Pakistan\u2019s DGMO dialled India\u2019s counterpart, seeking a ceasefire. The Z-category security cover is the third-highest level of protection in India. It includes 22 security personnel \u2014 among them 4 to 6 commandos from the National Security Guard (NSG) and local police officers. The person also gets at least one bulletproof car and escort vehicles. This type of security is usually given to well-known politicians or celebrities who may be facing serious threats. Back in October 2023, Jaishankar\u2019s security level was increased from Y to Z category after the Intelligence Bureau (IB) found possible threats. Watch India Pakistan Breaking News on CNN-News18.

Following Kaur\u2019s death, her family members blocked the Ferozepur-Fazilka highway, demanding Rs 1 crore in compensation and martyr status for her. Supported by locals and farmer unions, the family refused to cremate Kaur, calling the state government\u2019s Rs 5 lakh compensation a \"cruel joke\". Earlier, Mann had announced a Rs 5 lakh ex-gratia from the Chief Minister\u2019s Relief Fund and expressed deep sorrow over Kaur\u2019s death. \"Our government stands firmly with her family during this time of immense pain and we are committed to providing all possible support to help them cope with this devastating loss,\" he said.

The petition, filed by advocate Mathews Nedumpara and three others, called for immediate initiation of criminal proceedings, saying the in-house committee found the allegations against Justice Varma to be prima facie true. The plea emphasised that while the internal inquiry might lead to judicial disciplinary action, it was no substitute for a criminal investigation under the applicable statutes. In March, the same petitioners had approached the apex court, challenging the in-house inquiry and demanding a formal police investigation.

Justice Gavai has often spoken of the greatness of the Constitution of India that enabled his destiny. According to the Indian Express, last year during a speech, he said, \u201cIt is solely due to Dr B R Ambedkar\u2019s efforts that someone like me, who studied in a semi-slum area at a municipal school, could attain this position.\" He further ended the speech with the slogan \u201cJai Bhim\". Notably, Justice Gavai is expected to serve for about six months, retiring on 23 November 2025 upon reaching the age of 65. Justice Bhushan Ramkrishna Gavai was born on November 24, 1960 in Amravati, Maharashtra. He enrolled as a lawyer on March 16, 1985 and initially worked with the late Raja S Bhonsale, former Advocate General and High Court judge, until 1987. He began independent practice at the Bombay High Court in 1987, and from 1990 onward, mainly appeared before the Nagpur Bench. Justice Gavai then was appointed Assistant Government Pleader and Additional Public Prosecutor at the Bombay High Court, Nagpur Bench, in August 1992, and later became the Government Pleader and Public Prosecutor in January 2000. He was elevated as an Additional Judge of the Bombay High Court in November 2003 and became a permanent judge on November 12, 2005. During his tenure, he presided over benches at Mumbai, Nagpur, Aurangabad, and Panaji, handling cases across all domains. He was elevated to the Supreme Court in 2019, and in 2025, he was named as the next CJI by Justice Sanjiv Khanna. Justice Gavai is known for his rulings in contentious and high-stakes political cases. He was part of the Constitution Bench that struck down the 2018 Electoral Bonds Scheme, ruling that it violated citizens\u2019 right to information and undermined transparency in political funding. He was also part of the bench for important cases, including those involving Newsclick founder-editor Prabir Purkayastha and former Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia. In November 2024, a bench led by him held that demolishing citizens\u2019 properties without following due process was contrary to the rule of law."

            "title": "Will Swift Operation Sindoor Victory Pave Way For Years Of Calm And Unhindered Growth For India?",
            "text": "Operation Sindoor lasted four days, and India hit not just the terror headquarters in Pakistan but also 11 of its airbases, destroying nearly 20% of Pakistan\u2019s air force infrastructure. This swift victory was achieved without the costs of a prolonged war like the Russia-Ukraine conflict. India would hope it can now reap the dividends of this success and channel its resources towards peaceful growth. In fact, the pummelling of Pakistan could usher in several years of relative calm, free from major terror disruptions. This could allow India to focus on comprehensive national development. The military victory may have been swift, but its implications are long-term, ushering in a phase of strategic confidence and opportunity. The Indian economy is booming, the stock market is on the rise, and a US-India trade deal is around the corner. Pakistan\u2019s role as a terror state has been exposed through a military engagement, which was also a statement of intent, capability, and future direction. India has avoided falling into any geopolitical trap or getting entangled in drawn-out global proxy dynamics. Pakistan knows that there is now a high cost of sponsoring terror in India. India\u2019s air defence proved itself to be among the most advanced, superior, and reliable in the region. It virtually rendered Pakistan\u2019s offensive capabilities ineffective. When India struck back, its precision exposed the vulnerability of Pakistan\u2019s defence systems. For the first time in decades, it became evident that Pakistan\u2019s strategic depth was illusory. India proved that Pakistan was no existential threat, but just a nuisance to be dealt with. Before pausing hostilities on Pakistan\u2019s desperate plea, Narendra Modi made it clear\u2014any terror act against India now on will now be treated as an act of war. There will be no difference made between terrorists and their state sponsor, Pakistan. The era of dossier diplomacy, or sending letters to get justice for terror victims, is over\u2014now, India will strike. India is now a major military power with a credible deterrence capability. We have long-range missiles, an efficient air defence network, and a strong leadership spine that gives a free hand to the military. Pakistan\u2019s internal vulnerabilities show that in India, it\u2019s the beginning of a transformative era. Going ahead, Pakistan may well implode while India becomes stronger. India\u2019s success in Operation Sindoor also sends a message to the world that India is not to be trifled with. As PM Modi has said, India is the land of both Buddha and Guru Gobind Singh Ji, who declared, \u201cI will make one warrior fight against 125,000\u2026 I will make sparrows defeat hawks\u2026 only then will I be called Guru Gobind Singh.\" The PM also said that the success of Operation Sindoor has strengthened the nation\u2019s resolve, unified the country, safeguarded India\u2019s borders, and elevated India\u2019s pride to new heights. Prime Minister Modi emerges from this episode with enhanced credibility, both domestically and internationally. India only gets to build from here. Watch India Pakistan Breaking News on CNN-News18.

            "text": "Operation Sindoor Updates: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made it clear that Operation Sindoor has not ended, but has only been put on hold, and warned that Pakistan will be struck with a heavy blow if it carries out any terrorist activity on Indian soil. He termed Op Sindoor as the new normal, while also stating in no uncertain terms that India will no longer tolerate the \u201cnuclear blackmail\u201d by Pakistan. The Opposition, meanwhile, has demanded answers from the government over the \u201cinterference\u201d by US President Donald Trump into India-Pakistan affairs, calling for a special session of Parliament on Operation Sindoor and the \u201cunderstanding\u201d that followed on May 10 between the two countries to halt military operations on the Line of Control and the International Border. Indian military\u2019s top brass highlighted the synergy between the Army, Air Force and the Navy during Operation Sindoor, officials said on Wednesday. India appears to have had a \u201cclear edge\u201d in targeting Pakistan\u2019s military facilities and airfields during the recent four-day confrontation, the New York Times reported, citing satellite images. High-resolution satellite imagery, from before and after the strikes, shows \u201cclear damage\u201d to Pakistan\u2019s facilities by Indian attacks, according to the report. India is set to submit fresh evidence against The Resistance Front (TRF) before the United Nations Security Council\u2019s 1267 Sanctions Committee today. The evidence includes proof of TRF\u2019s involvement in the Pahalgam terror attack, where 26 civilians, including 25 Indians and one Nepali national, were killed. Pakistan\u2019s package for those who died in the recent conflict with India is nothing other than compensation for terrorists, said government sources. Operation Sindoor is not just a story of tactical success but also a validation of India\u2019s defence indigenisation policies, government sources say. The Congress will organise a \u2018Tiranga Yatra\u2019 in Maharashtra on May 21, the death anniversary of former PM Rajiv Gandhi, to mark the success of Operation Sindoor and express solidarity with all \u201cmartyrs\u201d, including Mahatma Gandhi and the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack. Notably, the BJP has organised Tiranga Yatras to mark the success of Operation Sindoor. India on Wednesday successfully tested a new indigenous low-cost counter-drone system, named Bhargavastra. Broadcaster India Today said that the test was conducted at the Seaward Firing Range in Gopalpur, Odisha. Developed by Solar Defence and Aerospace Limited (SDAL), the system is designed to target hostile drone swarms. READ MORE Union Minister Ramdas Athawale on Wednesday claimed US President Donald Trump had volunteered to mediate in the military conflict between India and Pakistan but New Delhi outrightly rejected any third-party intervention. In a statement, the military said, \u201cIndian aggression on 6-7 May 2025 targeted innocent civilians. While defending Pakistan with valour, 2 more heroes embraced Shahadat today\u2014Havaldar Muhammad Naveed Shaheed & Senior Technician Muhammad Ayaz Shaheed. Total martyrs: 13, injured: 78.\u201d Harsh Goenka, Chairman of RPG Group, voiced his concern on X, saying \u201cIndian (tourists) contributed over Rs 4,000 crore to the economies of Turkey and Azerbaijan last year. He urged Indians to skip these 2 places as both stand with Pakistan after the Pahalgam attack.\u201d \u201cIndians gave Rs 4,000+cr to Turkey & Azerbaijan last year through tourism. Created jobs. Boosted their economy, hotels, weddings, flights. Today, both stand with Pakistan after Pahalgam attack. Plenty of beautiful places in India & the world. Please skip these 2 places. Jai Hind,\u201d Goenka said. READ MORE The disbursement of the second tranche comes on a day when the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is holding virtual discussions on Pakistan\u2019s upcoming budget as the visit of its mission to Islamabad was delayed due to security concerns in the region. BJP leader Amit Malviya shared a news article stating that the Pakistan government has announced plans to reconstruct homes associated with terror outfits JeM and LeT \u2014 that were destroyed in the Indian airstrikes. \u201cThe Pakistan government has announced plans to reconstruct homes associated with JeM and LeT that were destroyed by India during #OperationSindoor, and to provide Rs 1 crore in compensation to the families of those killed in the airstrikes. As a result, designated terrorist Masood Azhar could receive a payout of Rs 14 crore,\u201d Malviya said on X. Days after Operation Sindoor was launched on May 7, Chief of Defence Staff, General Anil Chauhan along with tri-services Chiefs, called on President Droupadi Murmu at Rashtrapati Bhavan and briefed her about the operation. The President, who is the supreme commander of the armed forces, commended the valour and the dedication of the Armed Forces that made India\u2019s response to terrorism a sterling success. Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a Cabinet Committee on Security meeting at his residence today. This was the third CCS meeting since the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22. The CDS and tri-services chiefs provided a direct perspective from the Apex Leadership of Indian Armed Forces into the successful conduct of Operation Sindoor. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath warns terrorists and Pakistan that if they point a finger at India or try to harm the country\u2019s security and its citizens, \u201cthere will be no one left to mourn their funeral\u201d. We @CAITIndia have written to Union Commerce Minister Shri @PiyushGoyal and Consumer Affairs Minister Shri @JoshiPralhad urging them to ban the sale of Pakistani flags and all Pak merchandise on E-commerce platforms. External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar\u2019s security has been increased amid India-Pakistan tensions. Principal Deputy Spokesperson for the US Department of State, Tommy Pigott, said that the United States welcomes the \u201cceasefire\u201d reached between India and Pakistan. The marble traders in Udaipur have announced ending business with Turkey for siding with Pakistan during Operation Sindoor. \u201cUdaipur is Asia\u2019s biggest exporter of marble. All members of the committee had unanimously agreed to stop trade with Turkiye because of its support for Pakistan. 70% of the marble imported to India comes from Turkiye. Not just Udaipur, if all marble associations stop their trade with Turkiye, it will give a strong message to the world that the Indian government is not alone, industries and all Indians stand with our government. If we stop trade with Turkiye, the demand for Indian marble will grow,\u201d Kapil Surana, President of Udaipur Marble Processors Committee, said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will chair a Cabinet Committee on Security meeting today at 11 am. This will be the third CCS meet since the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack. Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated his statement, which he first said while addressing the nation at 8 pm on Monday, that India will no longer tolerate \u201cnuclear blackmail\u201d by Pakistan. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Adampur Airbase yesterday and interacted with the air warriors. He also shared a video of his interaction with them on X. The Prime Minister addressed them on the occasion with the S-400 air defence system in the background, from where he gave out a stern warning to Pakistan against plotting any terrorist activities in India."

            "title": "'One Or Two Lapses Not Same As Living In Adultery': Patna HC Upholds Maintenance To Wife, Daughter",
            "text": "The Patna High Court has said that adulterous life is no doubt a disqualification for any wife to get maintenance from her husband under Section 125 CrPC; however, any physical relationship of a lady with any person prior to her marriage does not come within the definition of \u201cadultery\" because adultery is an offence against one\u2019s spouse. A single-judge bench of Jitendra Kumar said the adulterous life of any wife subsequent to her marriage is undoubtedly a disqualification for any married wife to get maintenance from her husband. \u201cHowever, \u2018living in adultery\u2019 denotes a continuous course of conduct and not isolated acts of immorality. One or two lapses from virtues may be acts of adultery, but would not be sufficient to show that the woman was \u2018living in adultery\u2019. A few moral lapses and a return to a normal life can not be said to be living in adultery. If the lapse is continued and followed up by a further adulterous life, the woman can be said to be \u2018living in adultery\u2019,\" the bench said. The court rejected a plea by the husband that his wife was living in adultery with her brother-in-law, so she was not entitled to maintenance under Section 125 of CrPC. Even the plea of the petitioner that the woman is now divorced and she is not entitled to get maintenance under Section 125 CrPC was rejected. \u201cAs per Explanation (b) to Section 125(1) CrPC, wife includes even divorced wife and she is entitled to get maintenance under Section 125 CrPC if she has not remarried and it is not a case of the petitioner that his divorced wife has remarried,\" the bench said. The bench upheld the order by the Family Court, Bhagalpur, which directed the petitioner to pay Rs 3,000 per month to his wife and Rs 2,000 per month to his daughter towards their maintenance. It noted that, except for the allegation that his wife was having an illicit relationship with her brother-in-law prior to and subsequent to the marriage, there were no specific details regarding such a life of his wife. Even the conduct of the petitioner/husband during the subsistence of the marriage does not show that he was serious about his allegation, the court said. The bench pointed out, \u201cNo such allegation has been made in his divorce petition, which was filed not on the ground of adultery but on the ground of cruelty and desertion. Moreover, as per his pleadings, he was always ready to keep his wife with him. Such willingness on the part of a husband is not possible if he believes that his wife has been indulging in an adulterous life. Hence, the petitioner has not proved that his wife was living in adultery.\" As per the claim of the wife, her husband-petitioner herein was having an illicit relationship with another lady, and hence, he was subjecting her to ill-treatment/cruelty, and she was constrained to leave her matrimonial home to live at her parental home along with the child. Even in the divorce proceeding, the petitioner-husband could not prove his allegation of desertion by his wife. Moreover, one criminal case filed by the wife for alleged cruelty is still pending for consideration in the Court of SDJM, Bhagalpur, the bench said. The petitioner-husband also claimed that he is not the biological father of the minor daughter, as she was born on August 08, 2010, whereas his marriage was solemnised on March 18, 2010, which shows that the girl child was born just after 4 months and 10 days of his marriage. He claimed the child is not his legitimate daughter and that she, being born out of an illicit relationship of the wife with someone else, is the illegitimate child of another man, and hence, he is not liable to pay any maintenance to her. On this, the bench, however, said it would be pertinent to point out that as per Section 112 of the Evidence Act, a child born during the continuation of a valid marriage between his/her mother and any man is held to be the legitimate son/daughter of that man, unless it is shown by that man that he had no access to his wife at any time when the child could have been conceived. Relying upon the Supreme Court judgment in the case of Aparna Ajinkya Firodia Vs Ajinkya Arun Firodia, the court pointed out it was held that birth during the continuance of marriage is \u201cconclusive proof\" of legitimacy unless \u201cnon-access\" of the party who questions the paternity of the child at the time the child could have been begotten is proved by the said party. The court said the girl child was born here during the subsistence of marriage, though it is also not disputed that she was born just after 4 months and 10 days of the marriage. Hence, in view of the law, as provided in Section 112 of the Evidence Act, 1872, she was presumed to be the legitimate daughter of the petitioner because it had already been found that the marriage between her mother and the petitioner was valid and subsisting. The presumption regarding the paternity could have been rebutted only by the petitioner pleading and proving his non-access to the mother at the time when the child could have been conceived, the bench said. \u201cBut I find that there is no such pleadings and evidence on behalf of the petitioner that before marriage, he had no access to or relationship with the wife, except the bald allegation on his part that his wife was having illicit relationship with her brother-in-law prior and subsequent to the marriage,\" the judge said. The court also pointed out that the petitioner has never filed any matrimonial petition before a family court or any civil court regarding a declaration in regard to the paternity of the child. The bench also rejected the petitioner\u2019s plea that the woman was not his legally wedded wife on the ground that his marriage with her was forcibly solemnised. \u201cHowever, I find that, as per the evidence, that the marriage was solemnised as per Hindu Rites and Customs at Temple without any application of force. Moreover, I find that the petitioner has never filed any matrimonial petition for annulment of his marriage, either under Section 11 or 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act. I further find that he has filed only a divorce petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act and it goes without saying that divorce petition is filed by the husband only against his legally wedded wife. Hence, the plea of the petitioner that the woman was not his legally wedded wife, has no substance,\" the judge said. The court also emphasised that a strict standard of proof is not required in a proceeding under Section 125 of CrPC, unlike in matrimonial proceedings, where strict proof of marriage or paternity is essential. It said, prima facie, the court\u2019s satisfaction regarding the parties\u2019 marital status and the child\u2019s paternity is sufficient to pass an order under Section 125 of CrPC. It has also been discussed and found that any finding regarding the marital status of the party or paternity of the child in a proceeding under Section 125 CrPC is tentative and not final, and it is always subject to the order of any civil court or family court, which are the competent courts to conclusively decide the marital status of the party or legitimacy or illegitimacy of the child, the bench said."

            "text": "The Press Information Bureau (PIB) Fact Check unit on Tuesday debunked a viral video showing an Army officer blaming the Indian government, armed forces and intelligence agencies for the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22. The purported video, which has gone viral on social media, shows the alleged Army officer, who named himself and his Commanding Officer, blaming the Indian government for the dastardly terror attack last month in Pahalgam, in which 26 tourists were killed. However, the PIB said the video was fake and that the Army officer had not reported for duty since March 2025, and neither was he in contact with his relatives. \u201cPlease stay alert. Do not fall for any such videos,\" he said. Meanwhile, the account that spread the video of the missing army soldier has been withheld in India \u201cin response to a legal demand\". According to Army sources, the rifleman has been missing since he applied for leave. A case has been registered in this regard, and it appears the video may have been made under duress or coercion. Since the Pahalgam terror attack, the internet has been rife with misinformation. While a terrorist organisation linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) called \u201cThe Resistance Front\" (TRF) claimed responsibility for the attack, Pakistan has denied involvement in the incident. Reeling from devastating strikes by India, Pakistan has taken to peddling fake news and misinformation on social media in a deliberate attempt to distort international perception and manipulate public perception. The efforts of the PIB Fact Check unit in debunking fake news and dispelling myths have been vital in helping citizens distinguish between facts and false information. The Pahalgam attack prompted India to attack terror camps in Pakistan as part of Operation Sindoor. After four days of military hostilities, India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire, which was broken by Islamabad hours later. Watch India Pakistan Breaking News on CNN-News18.

India should make the Pakistan military pay the costs of the conflict, he added. Speaking about US President Donald Trump inserting himself into the situation, Zakaria said, \u201cIt is difficult to tell what exactly happened\u2026but it is clear that Trump quickly wanted to take credit (for the ceasefire) and did what he often does\u2026before thinking and consulting his officials\u2026And that is why his tweet and language used were taken badly in India.\" Trump treated both India and Pakistan as equals, said Zakaria. \u201cWhat India worked hard for 20 years was undone in one tweet\u2026Unfortunately, it is how Trump operates\u2026he did the same with tariffs,\" he added. The Indian government should convey to Washington the problems it had with Trump\u2019s approach, Zakaria said. \u201cAs PM Modi suggested, the meeting that Trump tweeted about was not true,\" he added. I don\u2019t know why the Indian government is so hesitant.\" India was attacked and still had to be restrained, said Zakaria. \u201cYou can push hard, but these groups want this,\" he said. \u201cIndia has the most to lose\u2026India is growing whereas jihadi groups need conflict. It is strategically wise to do what India did. Conflict with India helps General Asim Munir to build public support around him.\" Pakistan is a failed state being run by the army, Zakaria said. \u201cThese kinds of military ops provide you with a boost of support and unify the country,\" he said. \u201cThe challenge for India is to do a careful analysis\u2026Was it really successful? Where were the shortcomings, and what can it do better, and then think about what to do with Pakistan.\" \u201cImran Khan became popular because he was taking on the military,\" said Zakaria.

            "text": "A Kerala court on Tuesday sentenced a man to life imprisonment for brutally killing four members of his family, including his parents and sister, at Nanthancode near here eight years ago. The prosecution, during arguments on sentence, sought the death penalty for the accused, Cadell Jeanson Raja, but the court did not grant it, a senior police officer associated with the case told reporters. According to advocate Dileep Sathyan, the prosecutor of the case, the court sentenced Cadell to a life sentence for each of the four murders, but said that the life terms shall run concurrently. The court also sentenced the accused to seven years of imprisonment under section 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house) and for five years under section 201 (destruction of evidence) of the IPC and directed that the two punishments shall be served consecutively, the prosecutor said. The court further said that the life terms shall commence after the 12 years are served, the prosecutor added. It also imposed a total fine of Rs 15 lakh on the accused and directed that the amount be paid to his maternal uncle. On 9 April 2017, Professor A Raja Thankam, his wife Dr Jean Padma (58), their daughter Caroline (26), and a relative, Lalitha (70), were found murdered at their house in the Baines Compound near the official residence of the Chief Minister of Kerala. According to the police, Cadell brutally murdered his parents, sister, and a relative. The police had said that the initial plan was to kill his father, who had continuously neglected him, and that he subsequently went on to murder the others as well.

            "title": "'Go For The Kill\u2019: IAF Chief Amar Preet Singh Led Nur Khan Blitz, Tore Through Pakistan\u2019s Air Defences",
            "text": "\u201cWe should go for the kill,\" Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh told his team as India prepared for its audacious strike on Pakistan\u2019s Nur Khan Airbase, sources speaking to News18 said. Backed by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Singh handpicked elite pilots, shaped the rules of engagement and gave the Indian Air Force its clearest war signal in years. The result: an admission of damage from the enemy itself. Pakistan Army spokesperson Lt General Ahmed Sharif confirmed on national television that Indian missiles struck key military targets, including Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi, Murid base in Chakwal and Rafiqui base in Punjab\u2019s Jhang district. Satellite imagery released by a Chinese satellite firm (MIZAZVISION) showed the damage at Pakistan\u2019s Nur Khan Airbase. OSINT expert Damien Symon released the images on his X profile and showed that the Nur Khan air base facility had sustained heavy damages and and missiles demolished military support trucks inside the Rawalpindi-based air base. Singh\u2019s leadership and strategic brilliance were pivotal in the success of the operation, which crippled a critical Pakistan Air Force base and demonstrated India\u2019s air superiority. Sources said the strike forced Pakistan Army Chief General Asim Munir into hiding in a bunker for two hours. Known for his tactical acumen, the IAF Chief handpicked the finest pilots, ensuring that each strike was executed with unmatched precision. This was a well-planned maneuver designed to send a clear message of strength and dominance in the skies. The strike, which targeted key Pakistan Air Force (PAF) infrastructure, was carried out after final clearance from NSA Doval, sources said. The results were immediate and devastating. Pakistan\u2019s military confirmed the deaths of 11 personnel, including 5 from the PAF. Indian armed forces viewed the Pakistani military\u2019s actions as a misadventure that warranted a strong and calculated response after which the IAF bombed Pakistan\u2019s crucial airbases in Rahim Yar Khan, Sukkur, Chunian, Pasrur, Sialkot and Nur Khan in a coordinated assault. The attack stunned Pakistan to such an extent that Munir was swiftly moved from his official residence to a secure location, as Pakistan scrambled to respond, the sources said. The strategic brilliance behind the mission was the psychological impact it had on the enemy. Air Chief Singh\u2019s decision to target Nur Khan was not only a tactical victory but a bold statement of the IAF\u2019s ability to dominate the skies and disrupt PAF\u2019s operations. Born on October 27, 1964, in Delhi, Amar Preet Singh was commissioned into the IAF as a fighter pilot in December 1984. An alumnus of the National Defence Academy, Defence Services Staff College and National Defence College, he is a qualified flying instructor and an experimental test pilot with over 5,000 hours of flying experience on various aircraft. Throughout his distinguished career spanning nearly four decades, Singh has held several key positions, including commanding an operational fighter squadron and a frontline air base. He played a pivotal role in the MiG-29 upgrade project in Moscow and was instrumental in the flight testing of the indigenous Light Combat Aircraft, Tejas, serving as the Project Director at the National Flight Test Centre. His leadership was also evident during his tenure as the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Central Air Command and as the Vice Chief of the Air Staff.

            "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday called for strengthening people\u2019s participation to drive a \u201cwhole-of-government\" and \u201cwhole-of-society \" approach to eliminate tuberculosis. Chairing a high-level review meeting on the National TB Elimination Programme (NTEP), he lauded early detection and treatment of tuberculosis (TB) patients in 2024 and said it should be scaled up nationwide, according to a statement. He reaffirmed India\u2019s commitment to eliminating TB from the country. The prime minister reviewed the recently-concluded 100-day TB Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan, covering high-focus districts, during which 12.97 crore vulnerable individuals were screened and 7.19 lakh cases, including 2.85 lakh asymptomatic, detected. Modi stressed the need to analyse the trends of TB patients based on urban or rural areas as well as their occupations. As healthcare technology improves, Nikshay Mitras (supporters of TB patients) should be encouraged to use technology to connect with TB patients. They can help patients understand the disease and its treatment using interactive and easy-to-use technology, Modi said. The prime minister said that since TB had become curable with regular treatment, there should be less fear and more awareness among the public. He highlighted the importance of cleanliness through Jan Bhagidari as a key step in eliminating TB. During the review meeting, Modi noted the encouraging findings of the WHO Global TB Report, 2024, that affirmed an 18 per cent reduction in TB incidence (from 237 to 195 per lakh population between 2015 and 2023) at double the global pace, 21 per cent decline in TB mortality (from 28 to 22 per lakh population), and 85 per cent treatment coverage, reflecting the programme\u2019s growing reach and effectiveness. He reviewed key infrastructure enhancements, including expansion of the TB diagnostic network to 8,540 NAAT (Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing) labs and 87 culture and drug susceptibility labs, more than 26,700 X-ray units, including 500 artificial intelligence-enabled handheld devices, with another 1,000 in the pipeline. The decentralisation of all TB services, including free screening, diagnosis, treatment and nutrition support at Ayushman Arogya Mandirs was also highlighted, according to the statement. Several new initiatives such as artificial intelligence-driven handheld X-rays for screening, shorter treatment regimen for drug-resistant TB, newer indigenous molecular diagnostics, nutrition interventions and screening and early detection in congregate settings such as mines, tea gardens and construction sites were highlighted.

            "title": "Once Handpicked By Kalam, Dr Rama Rao Watched His Creation Pummel Pakistan In Operation Sindoor",
            "text": "As tensions between India and Pakistan escalated into full-fledged aerial warfare in recent days, a new chapter in the Indian military history was written \u2013 not by foreign hardware, but by an innovation that stunned adversaries and reassured allies. In a high-intensity exchange of missiles and drones, India successfully intercepted every single incoming projectile from Pakistan, thanks in large part to its indigenously developed Akash missile system. While Pakistan launched waves of drones and tactical missiles deep into the border areas in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujrat, India responded with clinical precision \u2013 intercepting threats mid-air, neutralising incoming F-16s, and protecting strategic assets. Among the defences deployed, the Akash missile emerged as a star performer, its performance so decisive that even the country\u2019s top military brass acknowledged its pivotal role in neutralising Pakistan\u2019s offensive. For Dr Prahlada Rama Rao, the scientist who led the development of Akash, watching the missile in action during the operation was deeply emotional. \u201cIt was the happiest day of my life,\" the 78-year-old told a YouTube news channel in a rare interview. Dr Rama Rao, who once worked closely with former President and missile pioneer Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, was entrusted with leading the Akash project as its youngest project director \u2013 a leap of faith by Kalam that has now paid off spectacularly. \u201cWhen we were first developing Akash, there were doubts from within our own forces. But I believed in our team \u2013 and Dr Kalam believed in me,\" Dr Rama Rao said, adding that now that very belief saved many lives and defended the Indian skies. In stark contrast, the Akash missile is priced at just Rs 2 to Rs 5 crore per unit. \u201cWe built something at less than half the cost of global systems, and it\u2019s performing at par, if not better, in our own terrain,\" Dr Rama Rao said. During Operation Sindoor, Akash was reportedly used to maximum effect. Sources indicated that multiple Pakistani drones and missiles were downed near the border sectors of Punjab and Rajasthan, with Akash batteries intercepting targets at altitudes and speeds that surprised even seasoned defence observers. Dr Rama Rao, who has also contributed to the BrahMos, Astra, and K-15 missile systems, emphasised that Akash was never intended as a weapon of aggression. \u201cThis missile is not built to provoke war. Its very purpose is deterrence; to establish peace through strength,\" he said. Currently involved in pioneering work on clean energy \u2013 particularly Low-Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) \u2013 Dr Rama Rao sees a future where India leads not just in defence but in sustainability as well."

            "text": "The Maharashtra women and child development department has expanded its \u201cmobile rescue teams\" initiative across the state, aiming to integrate street children into mainstream society and education. Launched in 2022-23 as a pilot project under the Centre-sponsored Mission Vatsalya scheme, the initiative was first implemented in six major municipal areas: Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, and Mumbai Suburban. Following its success, the state cabinet has approved its expansion to all 29 municipal corporation areas of Maharashtra. The initiative focuses on reaching out to homeless children, orphans, those with single parents, or those from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds living on the streets. Women and child development minister Aditi Tatkare, announcing the state cabinet decision on May 13, 2025, stated that denying these children their fundamental rights to education and healthcare constitutes social injustice. \u201cThe mobile rescue team scheme is more than a welfare initiative; it is a movement for social change. Every smile we restore to a child\u2019s face is a measure of this scheme\u2019s success,\" she said. The mobile units provide on-site medical aid, counselling, Aadhaar registration, and facilitate enrolment into anganwadis or residential schools. Children without family support are placed in child-care institutions, ensuring their immediate safety and long-term rehabilitation. The pilot phase yielded positive results, reaching 3,813 street children with services such as health screenings, nutritional assistance, and educational access. With the recent cabinet approval, Rs 8.06 crore will be allocated to deploy 31 mobile vans across 29 cities. The department is also contemplating future expansion into smaller towns, religious pilgrimage sites, and temple precincts, where many street children are often found. In collaboration with local NGOs, the initiative also offers de-addiction support, addresses malnutrition, and provides professional therapy for adolescents, ensuring a comprehensive approach to rehabilitation. By providing access to education, healthcare, and emotional support, the mobile rescue teams aim to transform the lives of vulnerable children. The scheme not only caters to their immediate needs but also encourages reintegration into families or institutional support systems, highlighting the government\u2019s commitment to inclusive and child-centric development."

            "text": "Madhya Pradesh Tribal Affairs Minister Kunwar Vijay Shah sparked a political row after making objectionable comments on Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, who became one of the most prominent faces of media briefings when India launched Operation Sindoor against terror hideouts in Pakistan, by calling her a \u201csister of Pakistani terrorists\". Viral videos shared by Congress showed Shah saying, \u201cJinhone humari betiyon ke sindoor ujade the\u2026 humne unhiki behen bhej kar ke unki aisi ki taisi karwayi (Those who wiped the vermilion off our daughters\u2019 forehead\u2026 we sent their sister to teach them a lesson).\" \u201cThey undressed Hindus and killed them, and Modi ji sent their sister to return the favour. Since Modi ji could not remove their clothes, he sent a sister of their community to send the message that if you make the sisters of our community widows, a sister of your community will strip you naked,\" he went on to say. Shah was speaking at an event at Mhow, where several prominent BJP leaders were on stage, including Union Minister of State for Women and Child Development Savitri Thakur, as per reports. The BJP leader\u2019s remarks were severely criticised by the Congress, including party president Mallikarjun Kharge, who deemed it as an insult to the Indian Armed Forces and demanded the saffron party to sack Shah with immediate effect. \u201cA minister of the BJP government of Madhya Pradesh has made extremely insulting, shameful and vulgar remarks about our brave daughter Colonel Sofia Qureshi. The terrorists of Pahalgam wanted to divide the country, but the country was united throughout \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019 in giving a befitting reply to the terrorists,\" said Kharge on X. The Congress President also lashed out at the BJP over relentless trolling of the wife of a navy officer who was killed during the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, as well as Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri and his daughter. Umang Singhar, the Leader of Opposition in Madhya Pradesh, said Army officers had no religion and were not identified as Hindu or Muslim. \u201cMinister Vijay Shah\u2019s statement on the top army officer is not only shameful but it is an insult to both the army and women. Be it an army officer or a soldier, he has no religion, he is not counted as Hindu or Muslim. They have only one religion \u2013 country,\" he said. Congress leader Pawan Khera said, \u201cCompletely unpardonable. These pseudo-nationalists have no respect for our brave armed forces. Will @PMOIndia & @JPNadda take action against this BJP minister?\" Completely unpardonable.These pseudo nationalists have no respect for our brave armed forces.Will @PMOIndia & @JPNadda take action against this bjp minister? https://t.co/I27vBte8cd\u2014 Pawan Khera (@Pawankhera) May 13, 2025 Congress leader and former MP Danish Ali also shared a video of the BJP leader\u2019s purported remarks. \u201cThis statement is a reflection of anti-national mentality. People of the BJP find religion even in army uniforms. Colonel Sofiya Qureshi is the daughter of India, the pride of the army. The minister who is calling her \u2018sister of terrorists\u2019 is insulting the entire Indian Army. This is poisonous fanaticism,\" he said. After massive backlash online, Vijay Shah clarified his remarks. \u201cWe respect the actions taken by the Indian forces that avenged the Pahalgam terror attack in which the vermilion was wiped off the forehead of our sisters. I don\u2019t want to say anything to those who are twisting my remarks,\" he told news agency PTI. \u201cShe (Qureshi) is a sister who has enhanced our prestige, it should not be seen in any other context. We respect her and will continue to do so,\" he added. Colonel Sofiya Qureshi of the Indian Army and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh of the Indian Air Force were the two prominent faces of media briefings, sitting beside Foreign Secretary Misri to share details about India\u2019s Operation Sindoor. She is a distinguished officer in the Indian Army\u2019s Corps of Signals, a branch responsible for managing critical military communication systems. In 2016, Colonel Qureshi made history by becoming the first Indian woman to command an Army contingent in a major international military exercise. She led a 40-member Indian team at Exercise Force 18, a multinational exercise held in Pune that focused on peacekeeping and humanitarian mine-clearing operations."

A demarche was issued to the Charge d\u2019Affaires of the Pakistan High Commission in this regard, a press release by the External Affairs Ministry said.

This is the first diplomatic expulsion following the brief but ongoing conflict between India and Pakistan.

            "text": "Adampur Air Base: Located just 100 km from the Pakistan border, the Indian Air Force\u2019s second-largest airbase in Punjab stands as a symbol of valour, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit bringing renewed national focus to it. Located between Jalandhar and Hoshiarpur, the Adampur Air Base is a fully operational facility and the second-largest airbase of the Indian Air Force. It houses the IAF\u2019s 47th Squadron, popularly known as the \u2018Black Archers\u2019. The Adampur Air Base, which also hosts a forward deployment of the 28th Squadron (First Supersonics), has long been a vital pillar of India\u2019s air defence network and played a pivotal role in Operation Sindoor. Adampur base serves both military and commercial purposes, supporting defence operations while also facilitating commercial civil aviation activities. Adampur Air Base, established in the early 1950s, stands as the Indian Air Force\u2019s second-largest air station and holds a key position in India\u2019s military aviation legacy. The base has played a frontline role in national defence, particularly during the 1965 and 1971 wars with Pakistan. Initially set up on March 16, 1950, as No. 305 Wing, the base was redesignated as No. 8 Wing in 1956. Its establishment was part of the IAF\u2019s broader efforts to expand and strengthen its operational reach following independence. Chosen for its strategic proximity to the western front, Adampur was designed to host fighter squadrons and enable swift deployment of air power near the border. Adampur played a crucial role in the 1971 Indo-Pak war, especially after Pakistan\u2019s Operation Chengiz Khan targeted Indian airbases on December 3. While the Pathankot base sustained damage, Adampur remained fully operational, providing vital interceptor cover. Under Air Marshal Randhir Singh, the IAF pilots flew relentless sorties, including Su-7s and MiG-21s, supporting Army operations and striking targets near Lahore. Adampur Air Base is a key strategic asset for India due to its close proximity\u2014just 100 km\u2014to the Pakistan border. As one of the IAF\u2019s most vital forward-operating bases, it enables rapid response, early threat detection, and swift deployment of air assets, supporting both offensive and defensive operations along the western front. Its central position close to key IAF bases forms a robust defence network: Adampur Air Base played a crucial role in Operation Sindoor, India\u2019s precision strikes on terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on May 7. Positioned near the western border, it ensured air defence readiness and supported offensive operations during the conflict. Equipped with MiG-29 squadrons, Adampur conducted air-to-ground strikes on terror targets across the border, maintaining aerial superiority despite rising tensions. Following India\u2019s strikes, Pakistan launched missile and drone attacks on May 9-10, targeting key IAF bases, including Adampur. However, due to its effective air defence system and rapid threat detection, the Adampur base successfully intercepted these attacks and safeguarded its infrastructure, giving operational freedom to the IAF. Today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to the air base was seen not only as a morale booster for the security forces in the wake of Operation Sindoor but also as a strategic move to decisively counter Pakistan\u2019s disinformation campaign. PM Modi was seen waving to the jawans against a backdrop featuring a MiG-29 jet and an intact S-400 air defence system \u2014 which Pakistan had falsely claimed to have destroyed."

The delivery agent, Rohit Levre, arrived at the customer\u2019s home to deliver a pizza but was told that payment would only be made if he spoke in Marathi. The couple, speaking from inside their apartment with the main grill door locked, refused to pay for the order when they found out he couldn\u2019t speak the local language.

Rohit stood his ground, saying, \u201cIf that was your condition, you shouldn\u2019t have placed the order.

A group of young people, known as Balmitras (friends of children), are stepping up to protect the most vulnerable. These youth volunteers, aged 18 to 29, ensure that children left behind when their parents migrate for work are not left alone, unsupported, or unsafe.

Jalna, in central Marathwada, is one of the worst-affected regions in the state when it comes to agrarian distress. Droughts, poor irrigation, and repeated crop failures have led to chronic poverty, pushing families, especially those from Scheduled Castes and Tribes, into seasonal migration. Parents move to sugarcane farms, brick kilns or construction sites in search of work, often taking their children along. These children face unsafe living conditions, disrupted schooling, and a lack of healthcare and nutrition, while some are forced into child labour or early marriage. Those who remain behind with relatives or older siblings also face emotional neglect and limited access to basic services. Enter the Balmitras. Their primary task is to raise awareness about the dangers of unsafe migration and promote the option of kinship care, where children stay back in villages under the care of grandparents, relatives, or trusted neighbours. Through individual and group counselling with parents, they help families choose this safer alternative. The Balmitras also run vibrant after-school programmes three times a week, offering a mix of academic support, games, life skills and psychosocial care for children of the migrant workers. These sessions provide children with a safe and nurturing space to grow, learn, and express themselves. Balmitra Bhimrao Tambe is a 30-year-old youth from Jalna district. His dedication to this cause over the last two years has earned him the title of Master Balmitra\u2014a mentor role where he now trains and appoints new Balmitras across villages. He takes pride in seeing the real change. \u201cWhen a girl refuses child marriage and chooses to continue her education, it feels like I\u2019ve done something truly meaningful,\" he said with a smile. Today, he and his fellow youth volunteers are being felicitated by the Jalna Collector for their contribution to child education and protection. Currently, the Jalna district has 649 Balmitras working across six blocks and the results are remarkable. Since 2014, the percentage of children staying back in family-based care during migration seasons has grown steadily, reaching 60.23% in 258 pilot villages. In 2024\u201325 alone, over 5,800 children stayed back in kinship care. Most were cared for by grandparents, others by extended family or trusted community members. A small number lived independently with siblings in child-headed households. This community-based care model is yielding significant outcomes like low school dropout rates, continued access to nutrition and health services, a significant reduction in child labour, early marriage, and teen pregnancies. Inspired by its success, the model has now been scaled up to 198 more villages, with leadership from the Jalna District Collector and the State Migration Committee of the Department of Women and Child Development. Balmitras receive no monetary compensation for their work, but what they gain in skills, confidence and purpose is invaluable. \u201cThe training they receive\u2014on child rights, communication, community mobilisation\u2014helps shape their personalities and future careers. Some of our former Balmitras have even gone on to become Sarpanch, leading their villages,\" Ravi Kelgaonkar of SACRED said. Bhausaheb Gunjal from Gramin Vikas Pratishthan agreed. \u201cBalmitras play a big role in preventing child marriage. They engage with young girls and their parents, convincing them to delay marriage and support education. We\u2019ve seen many girls who once resisted early marriage now excelling academically and winning awards in school,\" he added. For thousands of children in migration-affected communities, the Balmitra initiative is more than a support system. It ensures continuity in education, safeguards their mental health, and helps them grow up in a more secure environment. It is a model that is not just working\u2014it is thriving and becoming a blueprint for other districts across Maharashtra. Alpa Vora, Child Protection Specialist at UNICEF Maharashtra, said, \u201cIn Jalna, thousands of children are forced to migrate with their families due to drought and poverty. They miss school, live in unsafe conditions, and lose access to basic services. The Balmitra initiative is changing this. Trained youth volunteers now help children stay in their villages, attend school, access health services, and participate in after school and mental wellbeing activities. This model is not just protecting children\u2014it is transforming futures.\" Watch India Pakistan Breaking News on CNN-News18.

            "title": "Fixing Duplication: ECI Assigns New EPIC Numbers To Voters With Same ID",
            "text": "Solving yet another legacy issue, the Election Commission of India (ECI), on Tuesday, announced that it has issued new EPIC cards with unique numbers to all the voters who had the same numbers on their voter IDs so far. A poll body official told News18 that the ECI has given all such electors new EPIC cards with new numbers. In March, the ECI had announced it would replace all duplicate Electoral Photo Identity Card (EPIC) numbers with unique identifiers within the next three months. Explaining how the poll body achieved this, they said to resolve this long-pending issue, the entire electoral database of over 99 crore electors was searched by CEOs of all the 36 States/UTs and EROs of all the 4,123 Assembly constituencies across India in all the 10.50 lakh polling stations. \u201cOn an average, there are about 1,000 electors per polling station. The number of similar EPIC numbers found were miniscule, i.e. averaging to around one in four polling stations. During the field level verification, it was found that holders of such similar EPIC numbers were genuine electors in different assembly constituencies and different polling stations,\" they added. The genesis of the issue has been traced to 2005, when various states/UTs were using Assembly Constituency-wise different alphanumeric series in a decentralised manner, they explained. \u201cThese series had to be changed again in 2008, after delimitation of the constituencies. During this period, some ACs erroneously continued to use either the old series or because of typographic errors they used the series allotted to some other constituencies,\" the official added. Every voter\u2019s name is in the electoral roll of the polling station, where he/she is an ordinary resident. Having had an EPIC of a similar number never enabled any such person to vote at any other polling station. \u201cThus, the issue of a similar EPIC could not have impacted the results of any elections,\" they said. The more than two-decades-old legacy of similar EPIC numbers had surfaced again this year when political parties called the voters with the same ID number as fake and bogus. In February, the Trinamool Congress claimed that voters from other states were being registered in West Bengal with duplicate EPIC numbers."

            "text": "The Shiv Sena has called for immediate termination of a Turkish ground-handling company\u2019s contract at Mumbai\u2019s international airport, alleging that Turkey\u2019s support to Pakistan in recent drone-related activities poses a serious threat to India\u2019s national security. On Monday, Shiv Sena leader Murji Patel led a delegation to the Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL), urging them to end their association with Celebi NAS Airport Services, which currently handles around 70% of the ground operations at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport. \u201cTurkey may not be firing weapons directly, but supplying drones that are used to target our borders is no less than a hostile act,\" said Patel. \u201cWe cannot allow a country that supports our enemy to make money off Indian infrastructure.\" The Sena has issued a 10-day ultimatum to MIAL to cancel the contract, warning of protests if no action is taken. According to Patel, the party has already spoken with the airport\u2019s CEO, who has promised to review the matter and resolve it within the given timeframe. The protest has extended beyond political circles. Traders from Pune have also expressed solidarity with the Sena\u2019s demand and announced a halt on importing Turkish products, signalling a broader push towards economic disengagement from countries perceived to be aiding Pakistan. Sena leaders clarified that the demand was not political in nature but based on national interest. \u201cThis is not a business issue\u2014it\u2019s a matter of principle,\" said a party worker. \u201cWe are talking about a country that helps arm our enemies. Why should we let them profit here?\" With growing tensions on India\u2019s borders and increasing drone threats, especially in regions like Punjab and Jammu, concerns over Turkey\u2019s defence cooperation with Pakistan have sparked a wave of economic nationalism. The Shiv Sena\u2019s move reflects this sentiment, bringing attention to foreign companies operating in sensitive sectors. Whether or not MIAL decides to act within the 10-day deadline, the Sena has made its position clear: companies from nations that support hostile activities against India have no place in its critical infrastructure."

The attack targeted major ammunition depots and airbases such as Sargodha and Bholari, where F-16 and JF-17 fighter jets were stationed, sources said. As a result, nearly 20% of Pakistan\u2019s air force infrastructure was destroyed. Over 50 individuals, including Squadron Leader Usman Yusuf and four airmen, were killed in the bombing of Bholari airbase, they added. India says several Pakistani fighter jets were also destroyed. \u201cOn May 9-10, India became the first country to strike 11 airbases of a nuclear-armed nation in a single operation, destroying 20% of Pakistan\u2019s air force assets. High casualties were inflicted at Bholari airbase, including the death of Squadron Leader Usman Yusuf and destruction of key fighter jets,\" the sources said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already said that over 100 terrorists were killed in Operation Sindoor during the May 7 strike on terrorist headquarters in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

            "title": "Monsoon May Come Early As It Moves Swiftly Over Bay Of Bengal",
            "text": "Hinting at an early arrival, the southwest monsoon pushed deeper into some more parts of the south Bay of Bengal, the Nicobar Islands, and the Andaman Sea on Tuesday. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the seasonal rains are most likely to commence over Kerala around May 27 (+/-4 days). The four-month monsoon season is crucial since it provides over 75% of the annual rains over the country and determines the annual agricultural production, especially for the rain-fed Kharif crops. It normally sets in over Kerala on June 1, with a standard deviation of seven days. However, since 2021, it has been arriving early, except for 2023, when it made its onset on June 4. Last year, the monsoon began over Kerala on May 31. The MeT tracks several indicators to determine its onset: minimum temperatures over northwest India, pre-monsoon showers over the southern peninsula, mean sea level pressure changes over the northwest Pacific Ocean, cloud patterns over the South China Sea, and the wind shifts in both the lower and upper atmosphere across the Indian Ocean and Indonesia. \u201cThere has been widespread rainfall over the Nicobar Islands over the past two days. The strength and depth of westerly winds have also increased continuously over parts of the south Bay of Bengal, the Nicobar Islands, and the Andaman Sea. The outgoing longwave radiation over the area has also continued to decrease, all indicating the advance of the monsoon over this part,\" said Dr RK Jenamani, senior IMD scientist. According to MeT, the conditions are becoming favourable for its further advance into some parts of the south Arabian Sea, the Maldives & Comorin area, some more parts of the Bay of Bengal, and the entire Andaman & Nicobar Islands during the next 3-4 days. The forecasters are confident of above-normal monsoon rains this year, at least 105% of the long-period average (1971-2020) of 87 cm, with a model error of +/-5% in the forecast. In fact, the rainfall in May is also expected to end above normal, according to MeT, which has forecasted it to be nearly 109% above the long-period average (LPA). This comes amid ongoing thunderstorm activity over major parts of the country, bringing respite from long heatwave spells. Maximum temperatures have soared to 39-43\u00b0C over many parts of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gangetic West Bengal, and Telangana, with heatwave conditions sweeping West Bengal until May 15. IMD warned that heatwaves are also likely to begin over Jharkhand from May 13, Uttar Pradesh from May 14, and western Rajasthan from May 15."

His visa has expired, and he may be ordered to leave India at any moment. Wang Chi recently received a message from the Indian government to renew his visa, and his son, Vishnu, has stated that his father has been asked to report to the Foreigners Registration Office (FRO). The family explained that due to historical tensions between India and Pakistan, Wang Chi did not apply for a long-term visa from the Chinese Embassy. Vishnu fears his father might be forced to leave India, where he has spent a considerable part of his life. They are hoping for a long-term visa to avoid deportation, allowing Wang Chi to spend his final years in India with his family or in China, where he hails from. Vishnu expressed concerns about the financial burden of renewing his father\u2019s visa every four years, which costs Rs 15,000 each time. The family\u2019s financial condition is precarious, and they are seeking a long-term visa of five to ten years, but no action has been taken yet. For the first time, they have been asked to report to the FRO. Additionally, local officials in Balaghat have refused to issue caste certificates to Wang Chi\u2019s grandchildren due to his foreign nationality, hindering their access to government schemes. Wang Chi, known locally as Raj Bahadur, was arrested by the Indian Army on January 3, 1963 after inadvertently crossing the border into Arunachal Pradesh while serving as an engineer in the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA). Treated as a spy rather than a prisoner of war, he spent eight years imprisoned in India. Upon his release, he chose to stay in India, settling in Tirodi village, Balaghat, where he adopted the name Raj Bahadur, married a local tribal woman, and started a family."

            "title": "Why Pakistan Army Chief Asim Munir Is More Unpopular Than Ever | Explained",
            "text": "Once hailed as a powerful, pious and calculating tactician, Pakistan\u2019s Army Chief General Asim Munir now finds himself facing growing dissent \u2013 within his own ranks, across political aisles, and among an increasingly disillusioned public. His tenure, marked by intensified hostilities with India and a crackdown on political opposition at home, has thrust him into a storm of controversy and waning popularity. Appointed as Chief of Army Staff on November 29, 2022, Munir took the helm of the country\u2019s most influential institution with a reputation for discipline, secrecy, and religious devotion \u2013 he is known as Hafiz-e-Quran, a rare distinction among top brass. But the promise of stability under his leadership has since given way to rising instability both within and beyond Pakistan\u2019s borders. Munir\u2019s leadership has been widely criticised for stoking tensions with India, particularly following the deadly Pahalgam attack in Jammu & Kashmir on April 22. India\u2019s swift retaliatory military operations rattled Pakistan, leaving its armed forces on the defensive. What followed was a near-conflict scenario that many analysts believe was the closest the nuclear-armed neighbours had come to open war in recent years. While India blames Pakistan for harbouring terror networks operating across the border, discontent is also growing over social media platforms in Pakistan that saw a surge in anti-Munir sentiments, with hashtags like #MunirOut trending for days. Critics accused him of mishandling not just foreign policy, but also domestic affairs \u2013 especially the controversial imprisonment of former prime minister Imran Khan. That move, seen as politically motivated, alienated a significant portion of the Pakistani populace, particularly Khan\u2019s massive support base and religious-political factions like those led by Maulana Fazlur Rehman. The Pakistan Army, often considered a monolith of loyalty, is reportedly showing signs of fracture. Retired generals and defence analysts claimed that Munir\u2019s high-handedness and his strategy of promoting loyalists while sidelining dissenters have sparked discontent. Some military insiders, particularly in junior ranks and among veterans, are said to be uneasy with Munir\u2019s increasing injection of religious ideology into military culture \u2013 drawing parallels to Pakistani General Zia-ul-Haq, the controversial dictator who militarised religion in the 1980s. Munir\u2019s frequent Quranic references during internal addresses and his perceived alignment with fundamentalist viewpoints have earned him the moniker \u2018Mullah Munir\u2019 among critics. \u201cHe is not just politicising the army, he is theologising it,\" remarked one retired brigadier speaking anonymously to local media in Pakistan. \u201cThis is dangerous for an institution that prides itself on professionalism and strategic discipline,\" he further said. Despite the growing unease, Munir remains firmly entrenched in power. In a strategic move last year, the Shahbaz Sharif government extended his tenure by five years \u2013 an amendment passed quietly in parliament that ensures his command until November 2027. This effectively insulates him from any immediate political attempts at removal, although some analysts warn that persistent unrest in the ranks could sow seeds of a future internal crisis. Opposition groups have openly speculated about the possibility of a rebellion or even a coup \u2013 a scenario that, while unlikely at present, reflects the volatility Munir now faces. Meanwhile, the Pakistani government appears increasingly sidelined, with Sharif\u2019s administration reportedly having limited control over military affairs. Munir\u2019s influence continues to loom large in Pakistan\u2019s political and security arenas, but his popularity is confined to limited, and largely hardline, religious factions. Among mainstream Pakistanis \u2013 especially urban youth, civil society voices, and democratic institutions \u2013 he is viewed with skepticism, if not outright hostility. His failure to stem the tide of terror attacks in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has further dented his standing. Some argue that while Munir was busy flexing muscles across the Line of Control, internal security disintegrated, plunging the country into deeper instability. \u201cThere is growing consensus that Munir\u2019s policies are harming Pakistan,\" noted political analyst Zahid Hussain. Even within the Pakistani Army, there is a sense that he is leading the institution into uncharted and dangerous territory, Hussain said. Watch India Pakistan Breaking News on CNN-News18.

However, the Ministry of External Affairs had denied that there were any discussions of trade with the United States in the discussions that took place between the two countries since India launched airstrikes on terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). \u201cFrom the time Operation Sindoor commenced on May 7 till the understanding on cessation of firing and military action on May 10, there were conversations between Indian and US leaders on the evolving military situation. The issue of trade did not come up in any of these discussions,\" he said. This came after Donald Trump took credit again for stopping a possible nuclear war between India and Pakistan. \u201cI\u2019m very proud to let you know that the leadership of Indian and Pakistan was unwavering and powerful, but unwavering in both cases \u2013 they really were from the standpoint of having the strength and the wisdom and fortitude to fully know and to understand the gravity of the situation,\" Trump said in the White House on Monday. \u201cI said, \u2018Come on, we\u2019re going to do a lot of trade with you guys. Let\u2019s stop it, let\u2019s stop it. If you stop it, we\u2019re doing trade. If you don\u2019t stop it, we\u2019re not going to do any trade.\u2019 People have never really used trade the way I used it,\" he said. India has always firmly rejected any suggestion of third-party mediation on the Kashmir issue, stating that the only pending matter is for Pakistan to return territories currently under its illegal occupation. Without naming the US, PM Modi had hinted, during his address to the nation yesterday, that no third party had influenced India\u2019s decision to pause hostilities with Pakistan on May 10. Reacting to Trump\u2019s claims of stopping a nuclear war between India and Pakistan, the MEA spokesperson highlighted that Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Minister had himself denied the nuclear angle on record. \u201cThe military action was entirely in the conventional domain. There were some reports that Pakistan\u2019s National Command Authority will meet on 10 May. But this was later denied by them. Pakistan FM has himself denied the nuclear angle on record,\" he said. Jaiswal further said that India had a firm stance that it would not give in to nuclear blackmail or allow cross-border terrorism to be conducted invoking it. \u201cIn conversations with various countries, we also cautioned that their subscribing to such scenarios could hurt them in their own region,\" he said. Meanwhile, government sources earlier told CNN-News18 that there was no reference to trade in talks between top leaders of India and the US during the India-Pakistan military conflict. Notably, US Vice President JD Vance spoke to PM Modi on May 9, where trade was not discussed. donald trumpindia pakistan conflictIndia US tradeOperation Sindoor"

New Delhi made the decisive move to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty during a Cabinet Committee on Security meeting on April 23, just one day after the Pahalgam terror attack that claimed 26 lives. \u201cNow as per the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) decision of 23 April, India will keep the Treaty in abeyance until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.

However, Pakistan has undermined these principles by promoting cross-border terrorism for decades, he said. The MEA spokesperson also reaffirmed India\u2019s long-standing position that any issues related to Jammu and Kashmir must be addressed bilaterally between India and Pakistan, and that this policy remains unchanged. \u201cWe have a long-standing national position that any issues pertaining to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir have to be addressed by India and Pakistan bilaterally. That stated policy has not changed. The outstanding matter is the vacation of illegally occupied Indian territory by Pakistan,\" Jaiswal said. Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while speaking about the Indus Waters Treaty, which India suspended as part of its diplomatic crackdown on Pakistan, said that \u201cwater and blood can\u2019t flow together\". \u201cTerror and trade cannot go together, water and blood cannot flow together,\" PM Modi said last month during an address to the nation. India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, a historic water-sharing agreement brokered by the World Bank and signed with Pakistan in 1960. This marks the first time since the treaty\u2019s inception that India has formally halted its implementation, representing a notable shift in its diplomatic stance.

            "text": "The Ministry of External Affairs on Tuesday outlined the sequence of communication that led to the ceasefire understanding between India and Pakistan. Officials said the Pakistani Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) faced technical difficulty in reaching his Indian counterpart directly. The request was instead routed through the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi at around 12:37 PM. The message was conveyed to the External Affairs Ministry (MEA) and subsequently passed on to the nation\u2019s armed forces. \u201cThe specific date and time of the understanding was worked out between the DGMOs of both countries, commencing at 1535 HRS. The request for this call was received by MEA from the Pakistani High Commission,\" ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said. \u201cThe timing was then decided based on the availability of the Indian DGMO,\" he highlighted. A mutually agreed time for the conversation was later fixed at 3:35 PM, following which both sides agreed to halt military actions, the MEA spokesperson said. This is the first time the MEA gave details of how the ceasefire was reached and the involvement of the ministry in the ceasefire plan. The MEA spokesperson also said that an \u201cextremely effective\" action by the Indian armed forces and the Indian Air Force (IAF) put Pakistani air bases out of action and Pakistan urged a ceasefire in the face of the might of the Indian armed forces. \u201cWhere India is concerned, our stand was clear and consistent from the start. We would target terrorist infrastructure operating out of Pakistan. If the Pakistani military stayed out, there would be no problem. If they fired on us, we would respond suitably. Till the night of 9th May, Pakistan was threatening India with a massive assault. Once their attempt failed on 10th May morning and received a devastating Indian counter-response, their tune changed and their DGMO eventually reached out to us,\" Jaiswal said at a press briefing in New Delhi. Jaiswal pointed out that on early morning of May 10, the Indian armed forces led by the Indian Air Force (IAF) \u201cmounted an extremely effective attack on key Pakistani Air Force bases\". \u201cThat was the reason they were now willing to stop firing and military action. Let me be clear. It was the force of Indian arms that compelled Pakistan to stop its firing,\" the spokesperson said. \u201cPakistan will not get any sleep for a long time just thinking of our drones and missiles. IAF targeted terror bases deep inside Pakistan with speed and precision that left the enemy stunned. Pakistan\u2019s \u2018naapak\u2019 intentions have been defeated every single time by our armed forces,\" PM Modi said in his address from Adampur Air Force Base earlier this afternoon. \u201cGodfathers of terrorism have realised that casting an evil eye on India will only mean their destruction,\" he further added, warning Islamabad over its backing of terrorists. \u201cLet me be clear. It was the force of Indian arms that compelled Pakistan to stop its firing,\" Jaiswal said, referring to the Saturday ceasefire. When Pakistan Army intervened to save terrorists following the successful execution of the ongoing Operation Sindoor, launched to avenge deaths of 26 innocent civilians in Pahalgam, India gave a befitting reply. Pakistan then assumed an aggressive military posture but Indian response, which saw major damage to Pakistani air bases, forced Pakistan to stand down.

            "text": "The BrahMos cruise missile played a pivotal role in Operation Sindoor, delivering a clear message to Pakistan in the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack. Its successful use highlighted India\u2019s precision-strike capabilities and sent a strong signal to both Pakistan and the terror networks involved. The BrahMos missile is a versatile and formidable weapon, capable of being launched from land, air and sea, enabling strikes from multiple fronts. Jointly developed by India and Russia, it is renowned for its supersonic speed, pinpoint accuracy, and adaptability across a range of military operations. The Philippines is currently the only country with a confirmed contract for the BrahMos, having signed a $375 million deal in January 2022 for three coastal defence batteries. The first battery was delivered in April 2024, with the second expected in April 2025. However, renowned for its speed and precision, the BrahMos missile has attracted interest from over a dozen countries, with several nations currently in talks to acquire the advanced system. Indonesia: Indonesia is negotiating a $200\u2013$350 million deal to procure an advanced version of the BrahMos cruise missile. Vietnam: Vietnam is planning a $700 million deal that includes supply of missiles for both its Army and Navy. Malaysia: Malaysia is considering BrahMos missiles for its Sukhoi Su-30MKM fighter jets and Kedah-class warships. Thailand, Singapore, Brunei: These South-East Asian countries have shown interest and are in various stages of negotiations. Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Venezuela: These Latin American countries are eyeing naval and coastal defence variants of the missile. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Oman: These Middle Eastern countries have also expressed interest, with talks in advanced stages with some of them. The BrahMos missile system is currently India\u2019s fastest cruise missile. First tested on June 12, 2001, it has undergone several upgrades since to enhance its capabilities. An unmanned, supersonic missile, BrahMos can travel at speeds of up to Mach 3 and has a standard range of 290 km, which extends to 500 km or even 800 km in its advanced variants. It is capable of carrying a warhead weighing between 200 and 300 kilograms and can fly at altitudes up to 15 km. It can strike targets as low as 10 meters above ground level, making it highly effective for precision attacks. Watch India Pakistan Breaking News on CNN-News18.

A woman from Karachi, Pakistan, has accused her husband \u2013 a Pakistani national currently residing in Indore on a long-term visa \u2013 of deceit and betrayal. According to her, the man secretly got engaged to another woman in Delhi while still legally married to her. The woman, identified as Nikita, reached out to Indore\u2019s Sindhi Panchayat via WhatsApp, pleading for intervention. In her emotional appeal, she asked the Panchayat to help send her husband back to Pakistan, claiming he had abandoned her and was now violating both legal and religious marital codes. \u201cWe were married in Karachi on January 26, 2020, according to Hindu customs,\" her message read. \u201cAfter our marriage, I came with him to Indore and lived there for several months. My visa was short-term, so I had to return to Karachi. Since then, he has refused to bring me back and now I hear he\u2019s getting married in Delhi,\" she further wrote. Her appeal prompted the Sindhi Panchayat to formally approach the Indore district administration. A letter has been submitted to the Indore Collector demanding an enquiry into the man\u2019s actions and immigration status. The Panchayat also alleged that the man had illegally acquired property in India \u2013 a serious violation of visa norms \u2013 and urged authorities to investigate. The wife contended that all her efforts to reunite with her husband were met with silence. It was only through social media that she learned of his alleged engagement, triggering her to raise the issue with authorities and community leaders. \u201cThis is not just a matter of marital betrayal. It raises questions about how individuals on long-term visas are monitored,\" a senior member of the Sindhi Panchayat said, adding that the woman\u2019s appeal deserved to be taken seriously. \u201cIf her claims are true, this man should be deported,\" the panchayat added.

            "text": "A fresh wave of cyber-espionage from across the border has placed residents of India\u2019s frontier regions on high alert. Intelligence sources have revealed that operatives linked to Pakistan\u2019s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) are actively making fraudulent calls to Indian citizens, journalists, and defence experts, posing as Indian Army or Indian Air Force (IAF) officials. This covert operation is believed to be a desperate attempt to extract sensitive information linked to the ongoing military offensive by India under Operation Sindoor. The revelation emerged amid growing reports of suspicious phone activity in the Khajuwala sector, close to the India-Pakistan border. According to Amarjeet Chawla, the Circle Officer of Khajuwala, multiple residents have reported receiving misleading calls. \u201cIt\u2019s true that people are getting fake calls. These callers are trying to gather information about military movements and operations,\" he said. He emphasised that any suspicious contact should be immediately reported to the police and warned civilians not to divulge any information. Authorities have traced one of the suspicious Indian mobile numbers \u2013 beginning with 73 \u2013 being used by the ISI operative. Under the guise of Indian defence personnel, the caller attempts to build credibility by sharing fake identification documents via WhatsApp and introducing themselves as high-ranking military officers. This latest intrusion marks a shift in espionage tactics, with ISI focusing its efforts on soft targets, particularly defence journalists, analysts, and digital media figures. These individuals are being contacted under false pretences and lured into conversations designed to uncover classified or strategically sensitive details, including the movement of troops, air strike plans, or even developments concerning India\u2019s nuclear command. According to cyber defence experts, the use of WhatsApp for sharing doctored IDs and documents is a hallmark of ISI\u2019s psychological warfare strategy, blending old-school intelligence tactics with modern digital tools. The Defence Ministry and cybersecurity agencies are treating the situation with utmost seriousness. Public Relations Officers (PROs) in the armed forces have been directed to escalate any unusual or unsolicited communication received by defence correspondents. A public advisory from the Ministry of Home Affairs is expected soon, urging citizens, especially those in border areas, to remain vigilant. \u201cWe\u2019re witnessing a direct attempt to exploit the trust of our people,\" said a senior cybersecurity official who spoke on condition of anonymity. He emphasised that this wasn\u2019t just a digital fraud but an espionage, designed to undermine the national security. The spike in Pakistan\u2019s cyber activity is being attributed to the recent strategic setbacks suffered under Operation Sindoor. Sources claimed that incidents such as a suspected radiation leak in Pakistan\u2019s Kirana Hills region, coupled with sightings of advanced US-made B-350 reconnaissance aircraft, have sent shockwaves through Pakistan\u2019s defence establishment. In the face of this, ISI appears to be reaching out in desperation, trying to fill intelligence gaps through illegal and deceptive means. Authorities have issued clear guidelines for civilians and journalists to avoid falling prey to these deceptive calls: As India\u2019s security apparatus tightens its digital defences, officials remind the public that national security is a shared responsibility.

The Bomb squad personnel immediately rushed to the plane and conducted searches, said the officials, adding that Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel have tightened security all over the airport. This marks the second bomb scare at an airport since the Indian armed forces launched Operation Sindoor against Pakistan-based terror groups earlier this month.

Kuttay hailed from Shopian\u2019s Wandhama in south Kashmir and was the chief operational commander of LeT, and its shadow group, The Resistance Front (TRF). Adnan Shafi, also from Wandhama, was a top commander of the TRF and LeT, while the third operative, Haris Nazir, was from Pulwama. The TRF had claimed the responsibility for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, which led to 26 deaths. In response, India launched Operation Sindoor to carry out airstrikes targeting terror infrastructure within Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir on May 7. After three days of attacks from Pakistan and India\u2019s strong retaliation, the two countries agreed to a ceasefire on May 10. After the Pahalgam terror attack, intelligence agencies intensified their hunt for local terrorists suspected of role in the assault. Kuttay and Nazir featured on the list of 14 active and \u2018most wanted\u2019 terrorists operating in South Kashmir\u2019s Anantnag, Shopian, and Pulwama districts.

It will prove to be a major disruption in the activities of TRF and LeT in Kashmir,\" said sources. \u201cKuttay was in touch with the top leadership of Lashkar across the border, including Sajid Jatt. His death will disrupt the TRF/LeT\u2019s operational planning, recruitment, and attack coordination. His role likely included overseeing infiltration routes and funding channels,\" they said. Kuttay was involved in the firing incident at Danish Resort on April 8, 2024, in which two German tourists and one driver were injured. He was involved in the killing of a BJP Sarpanch at Heerpora, Shopian on May 18, 2024, and is suspected to be involved in the killing of TA Personnel at Behibagh, Kulgam on February 3, 2025.

The message sent from the air base, with Russian-made S-400 air defence missiles in the background, the Indian Prime Minister warned terrorists that another attack would lead to \u201cmore destruction, more demolition\". \u201cWe will not differentiate between godfathers and state sponsors of terrorism,\" PM Modi said, referring to Pakistan\u2019s policy of backing terrorists. He also highlighted that over 100 terrorists were killed in Operation Sindoor. Pakistan\u2019s Army and its intelligence wing, the ISI, have long been accused of supporting and cultivating terrorist groups as strategic assets, particularly in India and Afghanistan. International and independent investigations have linked them to outfits like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Hizbul Mujahideen and the Haqqani Network. India and other international actors have frequently raised concerns over Pakistan\u2019s \u201cselective counterterrorism\" approach, highlighting how groups operating in Kashmir or against Afghan interests often enjoyed safe havens. The 2008 Mumbai attacks and the presence of Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad have further underscored the deep-rooted nexus between Pakistan\u2019s security establishment and jihadist organisations it finds useful. Modi also praised the Indian Air Force (IAF) for completing its objectives during the recently-conducted terror operation, Operation Sindoor. During the counter-terror operation, IAF destroyed nine terrorist hideouts deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). This led to a retaliation from the Pakistani Army, who intervened on behalf of the terrorists, which brought India and Pakistan close to the brink of war, with Pakistani upping its nuclear sabre-rattling. \u201cOur \u2018lakshman rekha\u2019 for Pakistan is very clear; any terror attack will be met with definitive reply on our own conditions. Pakistan\u2019s \u2018naapak\u2019 intentions have been defeated every single time by our armed forces. IAF targeted terror bases deep inside Pakistan with speed and precision that left the enemy stunned,\" PM Modi said. IAF struck headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke (Markaz Taiba) and took out another indoctrination centre and base of JeM in Bahawalpur among nine other targets. These camps, some funded by Osama Bin Laden and some where 26/11 perpetrator Ajmal Kasab trained, have been used for carrying out attacks on India and destabilizing the Kashmir region and the broader South Asia region. PM Modi also highlighted that IAF, the Indian Army and the Indian Navy gave a befitting reply to the Pakistani Army. \u201cPakistan will not get any sleep for a long time just thinking of our drones and missiles. Our Army, Air Force and Navy personnel made the Pakistani army bite the dust and showed them their place. I have come here to pay homage to your bravery,\" PM Modi said, praising the IAF for efficiently operating complicated and sophisticated machines. Watch India Pakistan Breaking News on CNN-News18.

Second, India will not succumb to any kind of nuclear blackmail.

The Pakistani missile was shot down in the air itself by India\u2019s air defence system, but this dangerous escalation by Pakistan towards the Adampur airbase was the trigger for India to launch missile attacks at the nearly dozen Pakistani airbases, including the ones in Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi, and caused heavy damage there. Pakistan had claimed it had caused damage to the Adampur airbase of India, but the Prime Minister\u2019s visit on Tuesday debunked those claims.

            "text": "What began as an IISc student\u2019s industrial project in a modest Bengaluru laboratory has now become a critical lifeline for Indian defence forces. FIBROPLUG, an ingenious haemostatic dressing developed through a dynamic collaboration between the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and city-based start-up Fibroheal Woundcare Pvt Ltd, is providing rapid and effective bleeding control in urgent battlefield scenarios along the nation\u2019s borders. This patented technology, a silk-chitosan composite haemostat, boasts a unique bio-composite formulation that swiftly clots blood while simultaneously forming a protective barrier over the wound. This dual action makes FIBROPLUG an indispensable tool for military healthcare professionals operating in challenging, high-pressure environments where every second counts. A significant advantage of FIBROPLUG lies in its innovative design. Unlike traditional chitosan-based bandages that often adhere to the skin, causing potential re-bleeding upon removal, FIBROPLUG incorporates a layer of silk. This smooth interface prevents adhesion, allowing for easy and atraumatic removal without disrupting the healing process. The journey from concept to deployment began when Fibroheal approached IISc with a critical need in the homeostasis market. A student project in 2018-19, under the Prime Minister\u2019s Research Fellows (PMRF) scheme, laid the groundwork for FIBROPLUG. The product\u2019s patent is jointly held by IISc and Fibroheal, highlighting the success of this academic-industry partnership. Following rigorous testing and regulatory approvals, full-scale manufacturing commenced in late 2024. Today, FIBROPLUG is being utilised by Indian defence forces across 30 units, including field hospitals. \u201cThe incorporation of a silk layer to the chitosan base was key,\" explained professor Kaushik Chatterjee of IISc to CNN-News18. \u201cWhile chitosan is excellent for inducing blood clotting, its stickiness can cause issues. The silk layer ensures effective clotting without the risk of re-bleeding upon removal.\" Vivek Mishra, CEO of Fibroheal, emphasises the product\u2019s life-saving potential, stating, \u201cExcessive bleeding accounts for a significant percentage of battlefield fatalities. FIBROPLUG\u2019s rapid absorption and coagulation capabilities can dramatically improve survival rates.\" Bharat Tandon, founder of Fibroheal, sees this innovation as a significant step in leveraging local resources, particularly Karnataka\u2019s silk production, for advanced medical technology. FIBROPLUG stands as a testament to Indian scientific ingenuity and the transformative power of collaboration, bridging the gap between laboratory innovation and critical real-world applications, ultimately saving lives on the front lines."

            "text": "Amid the heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, security forces in Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s Shopian killed three terrorists on Tuesday. The three were gunned down after a cordon and a search operation was launched in the area after specific input about the presence of terrorists was received. The three terrorists killed in the Shopian encounter today were identified as Shahid Kuttay, Adnan Shafi Dar, and Haris Nazir. Shahid Kuttay was identified as the son of Mohammad Yousuf Kuttay, a resident of Chotipora Heerpora in the Shopian district. According to the details, Kuttay joined the Lashkar-e-Taiba on March 8, 2023, and had been involved in a firing incident at Danish Resort on April 8, 2024, in which two German tourists were injured. Kuttay was involved in the killing of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sarpanch at Heerpora, Shopian on May 18, 2024. He is suspected of being involved in the killing of TA Personnel at Behibagh, Kulgam on February 3, 2025. Adnan Shafi Dar, was identified as the son of Mohammad Shafi Dar, a resident of Wanduna Melhora, Shopian. Dar had been involved in the killing of a non-local labourer in Shopian\u2019s Wachi on October 18, 2024. Haris Nazir was identified as one from Pulwama. He was also involved in the attack on German tourists in April 2024. The encounter comes days after India struck terror targets in Pakistan under its \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019 on May 7, and neutralised five most wanted terrorists of these organisations, including the mastermind of IC-814 hijacking in 1999. The funerals of these terrorists were attended by senior Pakistan Army officers and police personnel, besides wreaths were placed on behalf of the chief minister of Pakistan\u2019s Punjab province, Maryam Nawaz, providing an open testimony of the Pakistan State\u2019s collusion with terrorist organisations.

            "title": "Did Indira Gandhi Really Ignore Richard Nixon's Call During 1971 India-Pakistan War?",
            "text": "The latest India-Pakistan conflict has renewed interest in the previous wars fought between the two rivals, especially the 1971 war that led to the creation of Bangladesh. Before the 1971 war broke out, then US President Richard Nixon warned India against taking military action. During a meeting with Nixon and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, then Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi reportedly felt insulted and walked out. Amid the recent India-Pakistan escalation, a claim has resurfaced on social media suggesting that Indira Gandhi also ignored a phone call from Nixon. Some posts claim the US President calls her four times in 16 days but she refused to speak to him. The story, which has circulated for years, adds a dramatic layer to the narrative of India\u2019s defiance against American pressure. To verify the truth behind this claim, it is essential to explore historical sources, declassified documents, and credible records. In 2005, the US State Department declassified taped conversations between Nixon and Kissinger from the period leading up to the 1971 war. These records contain no explicit mention of Nixon personally calling Indira Gandhi or her refusing to take his call. Most communication between the two leaders occurred through formal letters and diplomatic channels. For instance, Indira Gandhi wrote to Nixon on December 12, 1971, a letter recently highlighted by senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh in a social media post. In his book White House Years, Henry Kissinger wrote, \u201cWe tried to contact Indira Gandhi, but she was not available.\" However, he did not clarify whether she was deliberately avoiding the call or genuinely occupied. On the other hand, Indira Gandhi\u2019s advisor PN Dhar noted in his book Indira Gandhi, The Emergency, and Indian Democracy that the PM was deeply engaged in meetings with military commanders and diplomats. Given the wartime urgency, he wrote, any call from Nixon would not have been treated as a priority. According to biographer Katherine Frank in Indira : The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi, Indira Gandhi was aware of Nixon\u2019s hostility and may have deliberately delayed communication to avoid a direct confrontation. Historian Gary J Bass, in his acclaimed book The Blood Telegram: Nixon, Kissinger and a Forgotten Genocide, wrote that Nixon was furious India refused to yield to his threats. Whether Indira Gandhi ignored his calls or simply delayed responding remains debated, but many believe that her perceived defiance became a lasting symbol of her firm and uncompromising leadership. Whether or not the phone call incident actually occurred, it became a symbol of Indira Gandhi\u2019s resolve during the 1971 war. Political commentators have argued that it reflected her refusal to bow to US pressure and highlighted India\u2019s growing strategic confidence, strengthened by the Soviet Union treaty. While there is no concrete evidence she ignored Nixon\u2019s calls, it\u2019s clear she resisted American pressure. Many see this episode as emblematic of India\u2019s assertive foreign policy and Indira Gandhi\u2019s unshakable leadership. The crisis in East Pakistan, marked by severe repression and a mass refugee movement into India, prompted Indira Gandhi to take the bold step of declaring war on Pakistan in December 1971. This led to a swift 13-day conflict, resulting in the creation of Bangladesh. Many believe that the world, especially the United States, was taken aback by her resolve, having underestimated her determination and believing their threats would deter her. Despite US pressure, it was reported that Gandhi remained steadfast, reshaping the region\u2019s geopolitical landscape and reinforcing India\u2019s independent foreign policy.

            "title": "Amritsar Hooch Tragedy: The Poison That Makes Fake Liquor So Deadly | Explained",
            "text": "The spectre of poisonous liquor has once again cast a deadly shadow over Punjab\u2019s Majha region after at least 15 people died from allegedly consuming spurious liquor in several villages of Amritsar\u2019s Majitha block. Officials warned that the toll is likely to rise in the coming days. The fatalities, reported from the villages of Bhangali Kalan, Thariwal, Sangha, and Marari Kalan, sent shockwaves through the local communities. Despite public outcry and promises of reform, illicit liquor continues to claim lives with alarming frequency. But what makes such liquor so dangerous? Why does a cheap drink, meant to offer momentary escape, end in agonising death? The term \u201ccountry liquor\", also known as Indian Made Indian Liquor (IMIL) or Desi Daru, often carries a cloud of suspicion, but there is a crucial distinction. Licensed country liquor, made under government supervision, is tested and taxed. In contrast, the toxic variant consumed in this tragedy is typically unlicensed, made in clandestine distilleries using hazardous substances. Known colloquially as kacchi sharab or raw liquor, it is often produced using a volatile mix of jaggery, water, and urea. To hasten fermentation, illegal brewers frequently add chemicals like oxytocin, ammonium chloride, and other industrial solvents. These additives are not only illegal but potentially lethal. One of the deadliest by-products of such crude brewing is \u201cmethyl alcohol\", also known as methanol \u2013 a chemical not meant for human consumption. Unlike ethyl alcohol, which is safe in moderation and forms the base of consumable spirits, methanol is a toxic solvent. In improper brewing setups, particularly where fermentation temperatures are not adequately controlled, methanol can form in large quantities. Experts warn that once methanol is ingested, it is metabolised into formaldehyde and formic acid \u2013 compounds that attack the optic nerves and central nervous system. Victims often first complain of nausea, dizziness, and blurred vision. In severe cases, this progresses to blindness, organ failure, and death. \u201cWhen methanol levels cross 90 percent in a mixture, it becomes poison,\" said a forensic toxicologist, adding that such high concentrations can lead to cardiomyopathy \u2013 where the heart muscle swells and weakens \u2013 and optic neuropathy, which damages the eyes irreversibly. Tragedies like these are often dismissed as accidents, but the recurrence suggests systemic failure. Illicit alcohol continues to circulate due to lax enforcement, porous regulation, and the economic desperation of the poor who seek cheaper alternatives to legal liquor. Sold for a fraction of the cost of regulated spirits, bootleg liquor remains a tempting risk for daily wage labourers and marginalised communities. As the investigation over the recent deaths widens, public pressure is mounting on the Punjab government to not only punish the guilty but also dismantle the illicit brewing networks that have thrived in the shadows for decades. Most of the hooch victims were from working-class backgrounds and are believed to have consumed the illicit brew on the same day, Sunday. Several others are reportedly undergoing treatment, some in critical condition. Local authorities have moved swiftly, with the Punjab government confirming the arrest of two primary suspects- identified as Prabhjit Singh and Sahib Singh \u2013 from Rajasansi. According to an official spokesperson, both men are believed to be key suppliers of the toxic liquor. In addition, four others who allegedly purchased the illicit alcohol from the duo and distributed it across villages have also been taken into custody. Two FIRs have been registered, and further investigations are underway. This latest tragedy is an unsettling reminder of the mass poisoning that shook the same region five years ago. In 2020, around 130 people lost their lives across Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur, and Amritsar districts after consuming tainted liquor \u2013 one of the deadliest hooch tragedies in recent memory. That disaster not only exposed a vast underground network of bootleggers but also laid bare the deadly consequences of unregulated alcohol production."

A day after his address to the nation on Operation Sindoor, PM Modi Modi travelled to the Adampur air base on Tuesday morning and interacted with air force personnel, who have been in the thick of action during the recent conflict with Pakistan. The Prime Minister shared four striking photos from his visit: one with airmen and a MiG-29 fighter jet, another addressing a gathering with the S-400 missile system in the background, a third conversing with smiling airmen, and a fourth speaking at a podium with a MiG-29 behind him. One of many strategic messages from the PM\u2019s visit was to show that Adampur Airbase, the forward airbase that Pakistan attempted to target using a missile on the night of May 9, is fully operational against Islamabad\u2019s claims that it suffered heavy damage. PM Modi\u2019s photo with S-400 also assumes significance as the air defence system thwarted drone and missile attacks launched by Pakistan while MiG-29 was also roped in Operation Sindoor. The nation became aware of the S-400\u2019s capabilities when the system shot down over 300 drones in a matter of hours on the night of 8 May.

            "title": "Ranthambore Tigress Kills Forest Ranger Weeks After Killing 7-Year-Old Boy",
            "text": "The uneasy calm of Ranthambore Tiger Reserve in Rajasthan was shattered once again as a sub-adult tigress, reportedly the offspring of the famed T-84, fatally attacked a forest ranger near the historic Jogi Mahal. The incident, which took place on Sunday, May 11, ignited fresh concerns over growing human-wildlife conflict within the reserve and raised serious questions about the forest department\u2019s handling of rising aggression among young tigers. The victim, Devendra Chaudhary, a 40-year-old forest ranger, was on duty when he was ambushed by the tigress. According to a forest official cited by The Times of India, the animal \u201cgrabbed the ranger by the neck and dragged him inside the forest.\" Chaudhary was rushed to the district hospital but was declared dead on arrival. \u201cThis is the second death in a tiger attack within a month,\" a forest official official confirmed. \u201cChaudhary joined the forest department about 8 years ago, taking his late father\u2019s place as a forester. He was recently promoted to the ranger\u2019s post. He is survived by his wife and a one-and-a-half-year-old son,\" he said. The same sub-adult tigress, whose behaviour has become increasingly bold and aggressive, was earlier linked to the killing of a seven-year-old boy. These repeated attacks have turned the spotlight on the forest department\u2019s apparent lack of timely action. Despite growing signs of danger, no concrete intervention had been implemented to mitigate the threat posed by the young tigresses frequenting the tourist-heavy Jogi Mahal zone. In response to Sunday\u2019s fatal mauling, forest officials have initiated plans to tranquilise and relocate the tigress to an enclosure in the Taleda range. However, according to a TOI report, the move remains mired in internal debate. Sources told the publication that the proposal to sedate and shift the tigress is still under consideration. The delay stems partly from concerns over the tigress\u2019 classification as a \u201cman-eater\" after the two deaths. Forest department officials have so far refrained from making any public statements about the plan, likely due to the controversy that similar relocations have sparked in the past. TOI noted that the very enclosure proposed for the tigress sits within a vital wildlife corridor connecting the Keoladeo National Park and Ranthambore. This area has previously witnessed violent clashes between wild tigers and those confined within the enclosure. One such incident involved an aggressive male tiger, T-104, which was caged in the same facility. The captive tiger had a bloody confrontation with free-ranging wild tigers, resulting in severe injuries from the iron bars and heightened stress for all animals involved. Experts have since warned against keeping large carnivores confined for extended periods in core forest zones. \u201cThe decision to keep the tigress in the enclosure may prove to be wrong,\" a senior source reportedly said, adding, \u201cEnclosures in such ecologically sensitive areas need constant care, cleaning, and attention, which is difficult to maintain in the long term.\" Wildlife experts are now urging authorities to consider transferring the tigress to a more suitable location, such as a biological park in Jaipur or Udaipur. Some forest department insiders have also revealed that a pattern of feeding bait to the sub-adult tigers may have worsened the situation. \u201cThe tigress, which was previously unable to hunt, was regularly fed bait. This attracted vehicles and humans, reducing the natural fear the cubs had of people,\" a source reportedly said. This conditioning could have played a key role in the recent attacks."

            "text": "The southwest monsoon advanced into parts of the south Bay of Bengal, south Andaman Sea, Nicobar Islands and some areas of the north Andaman Sea on Tuesday, the India Meteorological Department said. The weather department said moderate to heavy rainfall lashed Nicobar Islands in the past two days. The strength and depth of westerly winds over the south Bay of Bengal, Nicobar Islands and Andaman Sea increased in this period, with wind speeds exceeding 20 knots at 1.5 km above sea level and extending up to 4.5 km in some areas. The Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR), an indicator of cloudiness, also decreased over the region. These conditions met the criteria for the monsoon\u2019s onset over the region, it said. The weather office said conditions are favourable for the monsoon to advance further into more parts of the south Arabian Sea, Maldives and Comorin area; more areas of the south Bay of Bengal; the entire Andaman and Nicobar Islands; remaining parts of the Andaman Sea; and parts of the central Bay of Bengal over the next three to four days. The primary rain bearing system is likely to reach Kerala on May 27, earlier than the usual date of June 1. If the monsoon arrives in Kerala as expected, it will be the earliest onset over the Indian mainland since 2009, when it began on May 23, according to IMD data. Normally, the southwest monsoon makes its onset over Kerala by June 1 and covers the entire country by July 8. It starts retreating from northwest India around September 17 and withdraws completely by October 15. The IMD had, in April, forecast above-normal cumulative rainfall in the 2025 monsoon season, ruling out the possibility of El Ni\u00f1o conditions, which are associated with below-normal rainfall in the Indian subcontinent.

            "text": "In the turbulent days following India\u2019s massive counter-terror offensive under Operation Sindoor, a name rarely heard beyond classified military circles began trending across global media \u2013 Kirana Hills. Tucked deep in Pakistan\u2018s Punjab province, this obscure location suddenly found itself at the centre of frenzied speculation, conspiracy theories, and strategic denials. It all began after India launched a blistering aerial strike in retaliation to Pakistan\u2019s failed missile and drone incursions across the border. Within three hours, the Indian Air Force (IAF) reportedly crippled 11 Pakistani airbases and destroyed nearly 20 percent of the infrastructure supporting the Pakistan Air Force (PAF). As images of wreckage and military briefings flooded news feeds, whispers on social media grew louder \u2013 had India struck Kirana Hills, the alleged heart of Pakistan\u2019s nuclear weapons program? Located in the Sargodha district of Punjab province in Pakistan, Kirana Hills has long been the subject of hushed conversations within military and intelligence communities. Often dubbed \u201cPakistan\u2019s Area 51\", the rocky hills are said to be riddled with underground tunnels and fortified bunkers, constructed in the 1980s. These reportedly house key elements of Pakistan\u2019s nuclear arsenal \u2013 warheads, delivery systems, and sensitive missile technologies. Amid mounting speculation, the Indian Air Force broke its silence. \u201cWe did not hit Kirana Hills,\" declared Air Marshal AK Bharti during a high-level press briefing on Monday, May 12. Addressing the rumours circulating across global media and defence communities, he said, \u201cThank you for telling us that Pakistan has stored its nuclear weapons at Kirana Hills, whatever is there. We did not hit Kirana Hills. It was not on the list of the targets we told you we hit.\" The statement, while dismissive of the conspiracy theories, underscored two things: first, that Kirana Hills is now accepted, at least informally, as a key node in Pakistan\u2019s nuclear infrastructure, and second, that India deliberately avoided targeting it, despite having the capability to do so. However, social media platforms lit up with theories claiming that an Indian missile strike had hit the Kirana site, possibly triggering underground tremors \u2013 some even linked a series of minor earthquakes in the region to supposed damage at the nuclear facility. Neither Pakistan nor the US commented officially on the aircraft\u2019s presence. Pakistani defence officials, however, rejected the claims outright, stating that none of its nuclear facilities had been targeted or compromised. But the silence on the nature of Kirana Hills only fuelled further curiousity. Beyond the cloak-and-dagger appeal, Kirana Hills represents something more profound for Pakistan \u2013 a symbol of deterrence. Since the late 1990s, Pakistan\u2019s nuclear capability has served as a counterbalance to India\u2019s conventional military superiority. Analysts often refer to the doctrine of \u201cnuclear blackmail\" \u2013 the idea that Pakistan uses its atomic arsenal as a shield behind which it can support asymmetric warfare, including cross-border terrorism.

            "title": "10 Languages, 10-Day Mass Connect & Modi\u2019s Message: How BJP Plans To Win Narrative War",
            "text": "Operation Sindoor is \u201cpaused\", as Prime Minister Narendra Modi puts it, setting narrative of a \u201cnew normal\" of \u201ccrushing terror universities\" like Bahawalpur and Muridke. In probably one of his most straightforward addresses to the nation, PM Modi refused to take any credit but showered praise on India\u2019s tri-service, paramilitary, and scientific community for Operation Sindoor. But in this age of information warfare, where Pakistan has flooded the internet with doctored video to suggest it demolished India\u2019s prized S400 air defence system, or their prime minister\u2019s midnight press conference claiming \u201cvictory\", how does BJP plan to take Modi\u2019s message of \u201cIndia struck at the heart of Pakistan\"? On Monday, PM Modi reminded the world that he still believes it\u2019s not the age of war but \u201cneither is it the age of terror\". The prime minister, using the occasion of Buddha Poornima, sent out the message of peace but with a caveat: \u201cThe path of peace also goes through power\". For those who wondered about US President Donald Trump\u2019s offer of mediating in the Kashmir matter, Modi left nothing to confusion for the domestic crowd. \u201cToday, I would also like to tell the global community that our stated policy has been: if there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on terrorism; and if there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).\" But the problem lies with the language in which he spoke\u2014Hindi. According to the 2011 census, only 43.63 per cent of the people in India can speak Hindi. The southern and north-eastern states, apart from Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim, have a very low percentage of Hindi speakers. For instance, in Tamil Nadu only 2.3 per cent speak Hindi. So how will Modi\u2019s message reach them? The government used Artificial Intelligence and dubbed PM Modi\u2019s speech in 10 regional languages in an hour\u2019s time\u2014Telegu, Bengali, Gujarati, Assamese, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil, Punjabi, Kannada and Odia. They beamed the regional versions in respective Doordarshan channels and released on YouTube channels, garnering massive eyeballs and taking the message deep. If the government is taking Modi\u2019s message of \u201cWe have defeated Pakistan every time\" to the masses with multiple languages, the BJP isn\u2019t sitting idle either. The party now plans to hold a 10-day nationwide mass connect movement through which it plans to not just portray a brave face of the BJP-led Centre but will inevitably do a contrast of response between Congress-led UPA era and BJP-led NDA era. The movement will be called \u2018Tiranga Yatra\u2019, which is expected to kick off from May 13 and will continue till May 23. BJP will not just hold press conferences across major capitals, but its member of MPs, general secretaries, and even select Union ministers, will be asked to tour certain states where they will reach out to intellectuals, senior citizens, trader bodies, clubs among others, say sources. BJP\u2019s Yuva Morcha and Mahila Morcha will also be used during this \u2018Tiranga Yatra\u2019 where the goal will be to claim victory and credit PM Modi\u2019s leadership, while highlighting opposition statements that came across as tacitly supporting Pakistan. BJP will mount a social media campaign with regular multiple reels on Instagram targeting the youth, while the cadres will distribute leaflets highlighting, in bullet points, why Operation Sindoor is a \u2018gamechanger\u2019, a BJP source told News18. With Bihar election scheduled in the year-end, less than six months from now, one can expect BJP to become more aggressive in its narrative war in the coming days.

On his last day, the CJI met colleagues at the Supreme Court and bid them farewell. The Chief Justice praised Chief Justice-designate BR Gavai and said he would uphold fundamental rights and liberty. Talking about him, CJI Justice Khanna said Justice BR Gavai has been his \u201cbiggest support\". \u201cIn him, you will have a great CJI,\" CJI Khanna told the ceremonial bench. Justice BR Gavai will take the oath as the 52nd Chief Justice of India on Wednesday. The ceremonial bench comprised the outgoing CJI, Justice Gavai, and Justice Sanjay Kumar, showcasing a rare moment of reflection, celebration, and reverence, not just for Justice Khanna\u2019s contributions, but the legacy of his uncle, former Supreme Court judge Justice H R Khanna, he took forward. CJI Khanna also said that he would not accept any post-retirement post. His remark came during an address on a ceremonial bench on the day of his retirement. CJI Khanna said that public trust cannot be commanded and asserted that it has to be earned and that the Supreme Court has done it. \u201cI am speechless. I carry a lot of memories. Once you are a lawyer, you remain a lawyer\u2026 Judiciary is a common term that represents the Bench and the Bar. Bar is the conscience keeper,\" he said. Justice Khanna was appointed as an Additional Judge of the Delhi High Court in 2005. Later, he became a permanent judge. He was elevated to the Supreme Court in 2019 and assumed the role of Chief Justice last November. During his stint at the apex court, Justice Khanna was part of several landmark judgments that included Article 370, decriminalisation of adultery, the electoral bonds scheme, and the EVM-VVPAT tally case. Justice Gavai, who would assume the CJI office on May 14, said Justice Khanna \u201cembraced his legacy\" and built his own. He called it not a farewell but a transition and said, \u201cWhat ends today is not a career, but the beginning of another.\" Justice Gavai acknowledged the weight of legacy Justice Khanna bore as the nephew of Justice H R Khanna, the lone dissenter in the 1976 ADM Jabalpur case who stood for constitutional rights during the emergency. \u201cTo walk in the shadow of such a name is no small task,\" he said, \u201cbut Justice Sanjiv Khanna did more than uphold that legacy he made it his own.\" Justice Gavai praised his predecessor for his clarity, moral conviction, and commitment to fundamental rights, describing his judgments as \u201csimple, elegant, and imbued with constitutional values\"."

            "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent out a big message by visiting the Adampur Airbase in Punjab \u2014 the forward airbase Pakistan attempted to target using a missile on the night of May 9. The Pakistani missile was shot down in the air itself by India\u2019s air defence system, but this dangerous escalation by Pakistan towards the Adampur airbase was the trigger for India to launch missile attacks at the nearly dozen Pakistani airbases, including the ones in Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi, and caused heavy damage there. Pakistan had claimed it had caused damage to the Adampur airbase of India, but the Prime Minister\u2019s visit on Tuesday debunked those claims. The Russian S-400 defence system and MIG-29 were seen in the PM\u2019s background, in another big messaging that the Russian equipment had served India well in the current conflict with Pakistan. India had got three squadrons of S-400 defence system since 2020 after signing a big deal with Russia in 2018 \u2013 this was despite great pressure exerted by the US, which had threatened sanctions against India if it went ahead with the purchase. More squadrons of S-400 are to arrive in India by the end of the year. Earlier this morning, I went to AFS Adampur and met our brave air warriors and soldiers.

Situated near Jalandhar, the Adampur facility is India\u2019s second biggest airbase and has played a key role in earlier wars with Pakistan too.

            "text": "What began as a suspected case of abduction in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Bulandshahr has now spiraled into a tale of wrongful blame, a tragic death, and a police investigation under scrutiny. In a disturbing twist, a young man initially named as the prime accused in the disappearance of a college student has been declared innocent \u2013 but only after his death. The case originated in the Aurangabad police station area, where a BA student went missing on May 2 under mysterious circumstances. Her disappearance triggered panic in the village, with the girl\u2019s family pointing fingers at 22-year-old Arjun, a local youth, accusing him of luring her away. Based on the family\u2019s complaint, the police registered a named FIR against him. But five days later, on May 7, the case took a grim turn when Arjun\u2019s body was discovered hanging from a tree near the village. Police were quick to term it a suicide, but Arjun\u2019s father, devastated by the loss, publicly challenged that narrative. \u201cMy son was innocent,\" he said in an emotional plea, adding that he had not run away with the girl. \u201cHe was falsely accused, humiliated, and now he is dead. This is not suicide; this is murder made to look like suicide,\" he further said. Even as the family demanded a probe into Arjun\u2019s death, the investigation into the missing student quietly continued. Days later, police traced the girl to Ginaura village \u2013 also in the Aurangabad area \u2013 where she was found living with another young man, identified as Mohit. In her statement to the police, the student revealed that she had not been kidnapped. Instead, she claimed she had eloped with Mohit, whom she had married in a temple. She maintained that she had left home of her own free will and had no contact with Arjun at any point during the episode. The police, now faced with mounting questions over their initial handling of the case, confirmed that Arjun had no role in the girl\u2019s disappearance. \u201cIt has become clear during the investigation that Arjun was wrongly implicated,\" said an official involved in the case. The revelation has shaken the local community, and raised serious concerns about the hasty assumptions that may have led to an innocent man\u2019s death. Calls for a judicial enquiry into both Arjun\u2019s death and the initial police handling of the case are growing louder. bulandshahrfake kidnappingKidnapping caseuttar pradesh"

His remarks were being widely interpreted as an acknowledgement of the military\u2019s role in the Pulwama attack, which claimed the lives of 40 CRPF soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan has been sharply denying its involvement in the Pulwama terror attack, despite India providing dossiers linking the suicide bomber to Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), whose headquarters in Bahawalpur were struck by India under its \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019 on the intervening night of May 7 and 8. Mehbooba Mufti\u2019s statement comes at a time when the Opposition leaders came out in support of the Army, praising the precision strikes across the border that came in response to the deadly terror attack in Pahalgam, which killed 26 people on April 22. In 2017, Mufti had sparked a controversy when she said no compensation had been paid to the family of Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani and his brother Khalid Muzaffar Wani, killed during an anti-militant operation in April 2015. Later, in 2021, Mufti also said that she would have given Wani \u201ca chance had she known he was trapped in the encounter\". \u201cSecurity agencies say they suspected three militants were hiding without knowing who they were. Had I known about him [Wani], I would have given him a second chance in the wake of ongoing economic activity, improving situation and booming tourism,\" Mufti had said. On May 10, Mufti had said India should embrace its leadership role in the subcontinent and take the first step to de-escalate tensions with Pakistan, as it is a moment for the country to stand tall and demonstrate that its true strength lies in its soft power and commitment to peace. Mufti\u2019s remarks came after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke to Pakistani Army chief Asif Munir, and \u201curged both parties to find ways to de-escalate\". \u201cEven though US Vice-President JD Vance initially said that America wouldn\u2019t intervene beyond a certain point in the escalating tensions between India and Pakistan, in light of the worrying intensity of the situation, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has now reached out to the Pakistani Army chief, urging de-escalation,\" Mufti said in a post on X. \u201cInstead, India should embrace its leadership role in the subcontinent and take the first step to de-escalate,\" Mufit said. \u201cThe world is watching us. This is the moment for India to stand tall and demonstrate that its true strength lies in its soft power and commitment to peace, not in nukes,\" Mufti added. Amid the heightened tensions between India and Pakistan in the wake of the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, a group of people protested in front of a Karachi Bakery outlet in Hyderabad, demanding that the bakery\u2019s name be changed.

Three senior IPS officers\u2014DGP Prashant Kumar, DG Jail PV Ramasastri and DG Telecom Sanjay M. Tarde, are set to retire by the end of May, leading to changes in the seniority list.

Among these names, strong contenders for the DGP position include Daljit Singh Chaudhary, Atul Sharma, and Rajiv Krishna. Currently, Daljit Singh Chaudhary is serving as the DG of BSF, while Alok Sharma heads the SPG, both having six months left until retirement. Rajiv Krishna, who chairs the Uttar Pradesh Police Recruitment and Promotion Board and serves as Director of Vigilance, has four years remaining before his retirement. Amid the upcoming change in leadership, the possibility of Uttar Pradesh getting its first woman DGP has gained attention.

            "text": "A pall of grief descended over five villages near Majitha in Punjab\u2019s Amritsar district, where at least 15 people have died and several others remain hospitalised after consuming a batch of illicit, poisonous liquor believed to have originated from a single source. The tragedy unfolded across Bhangli, Patalpuri, Marari Kalan, Therewal, and Talwandi Ghuman \u2013 all within a few kilometres of one another \u2013 turning what should have been an ordinary Sunday evening into a nightmare. Families say the victims had gathered and purchased liquor from the same supplier, unaware that it would prove fatal within hours. By late Monday night, the death toll had climbed to 15, with six more villagers still undergoing treatment in hospital. Authorities fear the number could rise further as symptoms of toxic alcohol \u2013 often methanol poisoning \u2013 may take up to 48 hours to manifest. \u201cPeople began falling sick in different villages shortly after consuming the liquor,\" said Amritsar SSP Maninder Singh, who confirmed that the police were first alerted around 9:30 pm on Monday. By the time the police were fully informed, several people had already died, and some were even cremated before police could reach them, he further said. According to Singh, five people have been arrested so far, including the alleged kingpin of the supply chain, Prabhjit Singh. Others named in connection with the case include Kulbir Singh, Sahib Singh, Gurjant Singh, and Ninder Kaur. Police believe these individuals were responsible for manufacturing or distributing the deadly batch. Initial investigations point to the liquor having been sold or distributed on Sunday. Villagers, many of them from economically weaker backgrounds, reportedly purchased the alcohol in hopes of enjoying a leisurely evening. What followed instead was a wave of vomiting, dizziness, and collapse. In many cases, death was swift and families had little time to respond. Eyewitnesses described scenes of panic as multiple homes suddenly became sites of tragedy. \u201cIt was like a curse swept through the villages,\" said one local resident, adding, \u201cPeople drank together, and then one by one they started dying. We didn\u2019t know what was happening.\" The police now face the difficult task of not only confirming the chemical composition of the liquor but also dismantling what appears to be a well-organised network for producing and distributing spurious alcohol. Officials from the health and excise departments have been deployed, and a full-scale investigation is underway to trace how the toxic substance entered circulation. Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar, Sakshi Sawhney, confirmed that medical assistance is being provided to all affected, and door-to-door surveys are being conducted to identify additional victims who may be suffering in silence. The Punjab government promised stern action against those responsible, with Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann expected to issue a formal statement."

            "text": "A the tensions between the two neighbouring countries escalated, most countries around the world condemned terrorism and expressed their support for India. However, a few hostile nations, including Turkey, sided with Pakistan. Following this, a massive call of \u2018boycott Turkey\u2019 was witnessed across the country with many platforms, including Ixigo, EaseMyTrip, suspending all flight and hotel bookings for Turkey. The call for a boycott of Turkey intensified after Indian traders started boycotting Turkish apples. Consequently, Turkish apples have vanished from the market, leading to a rise in apple prices from Iran. Wholesale prices for 10 kg of apples have increased by Rs 200 to 300, while retail prices have risen by Rs 20 to 30 per kg. Due to Turkey\u2019s support for Pakistan, Indian traders have become more assertive. They now prefer apples from Iran, Washington, and New Zealand over Turkish apples. Apples are sourced both domestically and internationally, and the India-Pakistan tension has also affected international apple trade. Additionally, road closures due to rain and the tense situation in Pahalgam have halted apple transport. The ongoing tension between India and Pakistan has disrupted the arrival of apples from Kashmir, which are stored in Controlled Atmosphere Technology Chambers and usually available in the market even after the season ends.

            "title": "No Mention Of Trump In PM Address On Operation Sindoor: India Treads A Fine Line With US",
            "text": "India is treading a fine line with the United States (US) with regard to Operation Sindoor, amid the Opposition picking up Donald Trump\u2019s remarks to target the government. Without naming the US, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the nation on Monday, made it clear that no third party had influenced India\u2019s decision to pause hostilities with Pakistan since May 10. Trump had announced the \u2018ceasefire\u2019 between India and Pakistan on May 10, even before India and Pakistan could declare so. Then on Monday, just before Modi\u2019s address to the nation, Trump said he had told India and Pakistan that there would be no trade with them if they don\u2019t stop hostilities. Government sources, however, were quick to counter, pointing out that Trump and the US found no mention in the PM\u2019s address. In fact, top sources also rubbished Trump\u2019s claims saying trade had found no mention in the three calls that the US had made to India on May 9 and May 10 before the hostilities were paused. US Vice-President J D Vance had spoken to the PM on May 9, while US Secretary of state Marco Rubio spoke to External Affairs Ministers S Jaishankar as well as National Security Adviser on May 10. India has been categorical that in no conversation did the US mention the trade aspect and only asked for de-escalation. Modi, in fact, was unmoved by the call by Vance on May 9, telling the US V-P that he won\u2019t offer any off-ramp to Pakistan, and promised a devastating response to Pakistan if it continues to act against India. India did so on May 10 morning by attacking a dozen air bases of Pakistan with missiles. Jaishankar\u2019s response to Rubio was similar, after Rubio said that Pakistan Army chief Asim Munir had told him he was ready to stop military action. Rubio was told by Jaishankar as well as Doval to \u201clet Pakistan DGMO say so directly to India\", and not through the US. \u201cAfter India\u2019s aggressive action, Pakistan started looking for ways to escape. Pakistan was pleading to the world to ease tensions. After suffering heavy losses, Pakistan\u2019s army contacted our DGMO on the afternoon of May 10. When Pakistan appealed and said that it will not indulge in any sort of terror activities or military audacity further, India considered it,\" the PM said in his address, discounting the US role. Trump\u2019s offer to mediate on Kashmir was also rebuffed by Modi without naming the US. \u201cThe only talk with Pakistan will be on terror and PoK,\" Modi announced. On Tuesday, India also proposed to impose retaliatory duties under the WTO (World Trade Organisation) norms against the US over American tariffs on steel and aluminium in the name of safeguard measures. \u201cThe safeguard measures would affect $7.6-billion imports into the US of the relevant products originating in India, on which the duty collection would be $1.91 billion,\" a WTO communication said. All these developments are coming ahead of the landmark India-US trade deal expected by fall this year. During Vance\u2019s visit to India, it was declared that both sides had made excellent progress on it. Watch India Pakistan Breaking News on CNN-News18.

            "text": "India\u2019s robust, multi-layered air defence system successfully intercepted Pakistan\u2019s attempted drone and missile attacks following Operation Sindoor, before a ceasefire came into effect on May 10. News18 breaks down the country\u2019s formidable four-tier air defence system, one of the most critical pillars of India\u2019s national security. India\u2019s multi-layered air defence network is built to detect, track, and neutralise aerial threats at multiple ranges, forming a strong shield against enemy attacks. During the recent threat from Pakistan, the Indian Air Force\u2019s Integrated Air Command and Control System (IACCS) deployed a potent mix of Russian S-400 Triumph systems, indigenous Akash and Samar missiles, Barak-8 medium-range surface-to-air missiles and advanced anti-drone systems. Each layer of this defence grid is specifically designed to intercept threats based on their distance and altitude, ensuring a swift and effective response. First Layer: The innermost layer is dedicated to neutralising very short-range aerial threats, such as low-flying drones. It includes systems like the L-70 anti-aircraft guns, Igla and Strela MANPADS, ZU-23-2B guns, Shilka and Tunguska. These are effective within a range of up to 10 km. Second Layer: The second layer, known as the point defence system, is tasked with protecting specific areas or critical assets. This layer consists of short-range surface-to-air missile systems such as Akash, Spyder, Samar, Pechora and Osa-AK with interception capabilities of up to 50 km. Third Layer: The third tier is equipped with medium-range missiles, including the indigenous Akash system and the Indo-Israeli Medium-Range Surface-to-Air Missile (MRSAM). These are designed to intercept threats at greater distances. This tier comprises missile systems like Barak and Rakshak, capable of targeting aerial threats at distances of up to 100 km. Fourth Layer: The outermost and longest-range tier features the Russian-made S-400 Triumph system, which can detect and destroy threats as far as 400 km away. It can intercept enemy aircraft and missiles far before they reach Indian airspace. In this multi-layered air defence grid, older but reliable systems like the Pechora, Osa-AK and air defence guns played a crucial role. Air Force officer Awadhesh Kumar Bharti said, \u201cThis air defence system neutralised every aerial threat from the enemy. The performance of the indigenous Akash missile system, in particular, was highly commendable.\" According to reports, Indian air defence units successfully intercepted and destroyed a range of threats, including Chinese PL-15 missiles, long-range rockets, loitering munitions and Turkish-made drones.

Defence sources warned of the potent threats posed by seen in Indian skies almost every evening since May 7. Indian armed forces on Monday engaged suspected drones spotted along the International Border in Samba district of Jammu and Kashmir, the Army said, adding that there is no cause for alarm. The drone activity came hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s first address to the nation after Operation Sindoor and the meeting between the Directors General of Military Operations (DGMOs) of India and Pakistan. #WATCH | J&K: Red streaks seen and explosions heard as India\u2019s air defence intercepts Pakistani drones amid blackout in Samba.(Visuals deferred by unspecified time) pic.twitter.com/EyiBfKg6hs \u201cA small number of suspected drones have been observed near Samba in J&K. They are being engaged,\" the Army stated. A video clip of Indian air defence systems intercepting one of the drones was shared by ANI on X. \u201cDrones were seen in Poonch, Udhampur last night. The irritation is going on. This happens every evening. This could be the new normal,\" said sources. However, they also warned that this could be dangerous. \u201cThere is a possibility of weapons, ammunition, drugs, money or even terrorists being transported. It calls for a rethink. Not every drone can be fired because it leads to panic in cities. Drones eliminate the need for physical infiltration through the LoC, making them a real threat,\" they said. Hamas used small drones, converted to carry munitions, in its attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023. Hamas members also used them to attack IDF observation posts, including one equipped with a remote machine gun. In 2023, News18 had exclusively reported how a Pakistan-based terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) outfit had dropped a terrorist in Punjab using a drone. CNN-News18 had accessed the video showing the terror group testing the capability of dropping terrorists into the Indian territory via drones that can carry payloads of up to 70kg. The exclusive video, shot inside an LeT drone training camp in Pakistan\u2019s Shakargarh, showed terrorists testing the capability of the drones to carry a human and dropping him in water. \u201cA few months ago, a terrorist was sent to Punjab using a drone,\" the source had said. \u201cHe disclosed that he was sent by the LeT top brass and was given money. He was told to go by drone and settle in Punjab where he was to be given a task,\" the source added. Watch India Pakistan Breaking News on CNN-News18.

            "title": "Pakistan Army Says 11 Soldiers Killed In India's Operation Sindoor In First Such Admission",
            "text": "The Pakistani army acknowledged that 11 of its military personnel were killed in the recent escalation of conflict with India, triggered by the Pahalgam terror attack. As per a statement released by the Pakistani army, 78 personnel from both the country\u2019s army and the air force sustained injuries during the four-day period of heightened tensions between the two neighbouring nations. Pakistan said that the strikes resulted in the deaths of 40 civilians. Among the deceased, Islamabad stated there were 7 women and 15 children. Additionally, 121 civilians sustained injuries, including 10 women and 27 children, according to their statement. Pakistan\u2019s armed forces and the people of Pakistan pay solemn tribute to the deceased civilians and military personnel, the statement read, adding, \u201cLet there be no ambiguity: any attempt to challenge Pakistan\u2019s sovereignty or territorial integrity, ever again, shall be met with a swift, full-spectrum, and decisive response.\" This admission comes after India\u2019s armed forces conducted precision strikes on nine terrorist sites within Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK) and said that it neutralized over 100 terrorists. India stated that its retaliatory actions against Pakistan resulted in the deaths of approximately 30 to 40 Pakistani personnel. The Indian forces also said that they successfully downed several Pakistani military aircraft during the period of heightened tensions. In response to India\u2019s counter-terrorism operation, the Pakistani military launched a significant barrage of drones and other projectiles aimed at Indian military installations and civilian areas. However, Indian forces successfully intercepted and neutralized the majority of these incoming projectiles, thwarting the attacks. As Pakistan\u2019s assault on civilian areas persisted, India retaliated by targeting air bases deep within Pakistani territory resulting in the destruction of critical infrastructure, including air strips. Subsequently, the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) of Pakistan contacted his Indian counterpart, urging a cessation of hostilities. In his address to the nation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Operation Sindoor has set up a \u201cnew normal\" as India gave a befitting reply to Pakistan. \u201cFirst, if there is a terrorist attack on India, a fitting reply will be given. We will give a befitting response on our terms only. We will take strict action at every place from where the roots of terrorism emerge. Secondly, India will not tolerate any nuclear blackmail. India will strike precisely and decisively at the terrorist hideouts developing under the cover of nuclear blackmail. Thirdly, we will not differentiate between the government sponsoring terrorism and the masterminds of terrorism,\" he said. \u201cDuring Operation Sindoor the world has again seen the ugly face of Pakistan, when top Pakistani army officers came to bid farewell to the slain terrorists. This is strong evidence of state-sponsored terrorism. We will continue to take decisive steps to protect India and our citizens from any threat,\" the Prime Minister stated.

            "text": "Three personnel of Kolkata Police have been suspended following multiple complaints of misconduct. Sources told News18 that the top brass of the force are \u201cdeeply displeased\" with the behaviour of certain officers and have made it clear that such conduct will no longer be tolerated. The issue gained public attention in the last week of April when a video uploaded by a local named Souparno Adhikary went viral on social media. The video showed a heated argument between a police officer and a bike taxi driver over digital documentation, during which the officer was seen slapping the driver. Sources from the Kolkata Police confirmed to News18 that the officer involved is an Assistant Sub-Inspector. He has since been suspended, and departmental proceedings have been initiated against him. This is not an isolated incident. Sources reveal that several other complaints regarding police behaviour have surfaced recently, further aggravating the senior leadership of the force. There have also been allegations that citizens often face difficulties and uncooperative behaviour when they visit police stations to file complaints. A senior officer told News18, \u201cMisconduct that tarnishes the image of the police will not be tolerated. Strict action will be taken, and more disciplinary measures are expected.\" Kolkata Police Commissioner Manoj Verma reportedly meets divisional heads, Joint commissioners, and additional commissioners twice a week during which, sources say, he emphasises the importance of professional and respectful behaviour among officers. \u201cThe duty of the police is to protect and assist the public. Their behaviour should inspire confidence, not fear,\" a source stated. The suspension of the three officers is being viewed as a warning that stricter action will follow if such incidents continue."

            "text": "Air Marshal A K Bharti had captivated the journalists on Monday when he quoted a couplet from Ramcharitmanas. No one had expected such high literature at a military briefing on \u2018misadventures\u2019 of Pakistan. The objective of the air warrior was to drive home a message on \u201cpatience that is followed by anger\". This briefing, when compared to Pakistan army\u2019s media interaction on Sunday, left many stunned as the neighbour\u2019s military explicitly admitted to Islamabad\u2019s \u201cunwavering support for jihad\". A report by an Indian national daily stated that Pakistan army\u2019s admission blurs any distinction between the \u201cuniformed jihadis and those without\", such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Muhammed \u2014 who have been waging war against India for decades by infiltrating terrorists into Kashmir and other regions, targeting both civilians and armed forces. Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (DG-ISPR) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif said at a press briefing on Sunday that Islam was not just integral to the faith of individual soldiers but was part of the army\u2019s training. His response came when a journalist asked him if the name of Pakistan army\u2019s operation, \u2018Bunyanum Marsoos\u2019, and early morning attacks on Indian civilians and military establishments were guided by the path shown by Allah. The question and the reply are not surprising though as the Pakistan army has always openly embraced its Islamic foundation, proudly displaying the motto \u2018Iman, Taqwa, Jihad fiSabilillah\u2019 (faith, piety, struggle in the name of God). It is part of our faith, it is what drives us,\" Lt Gen Sharif said. Elaborating on the army\u2019s motto, he said, \u201cWe have an army chief who has a strong belief in it. The leadership and his belief and commitment translates into different operations.\" On Pakistan army naming its operation \u2018Bunyanum Marsoos\u2019, he said those who fight for Allah are like a \u201csteel wall\". \"Jihad. That's what drives us. That's our motto.\"DG ISPR during the press conference yesterday. How has this not received more attention??? pic.twitter.com/5evIyt4FLy Lt Gen Sharif has been in the news not just for his professional role but also due to his connections with jihadi groups. Some reports surfaced recently claimed that his father, Mahmood Sultan Bashiruddin, a former scientist with the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, was linked to extremist organizations and even associated with Osama bin Laden. \u201cWhat message is being conveyed\u2026 A hint is enough for a wise person,\" Bharti remarked, prompting applause from the audience.

Birla\u2019s suit against X, Google and John Doe (unknown entities) was decreed by Justice Jyoti Singh. An interim injunction order was passed in favour of Birla by a coordinate bench in July last year, directing social media platforms to take down the concerned social media posts. In its order, the court had directed X and Google to remove or block social media content against Birla until further orders. Decreeing the suit today, Justice Singh was informed by counsel for X that out of the 16 impugned posts in the suit, 12 were removed by the originators whereas access to the remaining 4 posts was blocked by the social media platform as per the interim injunction order. The court decreed the suit while directing X to remove the remaining four social media posts, Live Law reported. It added that in case by Birla brings to the notice of X any identical posts, the same shall be removed by the social media platform. Furthermore, the court directed Google to remove one post which was blocked pursuant to the interim order. According to the report, Justice Singh noted that Birla did not press claim for damages or for refund of court fees. Senior advocate Rajiv Nayar appeared for Anjali Birla. The plaint was filed by advocates Aditya Bharat Manubarwala and Sanyam Khetarpal. In her complaint, Birla had submitted that she was being character assassinated, and that such social media posts were causing damage to her reputation. She had also submitted that dissemination of the social media posts and tweets was adversely affecting her position in the public office."

During the course of the trial, the prosecution presented a substantial body of evidence, including the testimonies of over 50 witnesses, more than 200 crucial documents, and a significant 400 pieces of digital evidence. In a powerful display of resilience, eight survivors personally appeared before the court to recount their harrowing experiences. Furthermore, the accused were required to respond to a comprehensive set of 50 questions in written form as part of the legal proceedings. Following the verdict, public prosecutor Surendra Mohan said, \u201cThe court has held all nine accused guilty. They sought leniency, citing their age and the old age of their parents. However, we argued that this is a very rare case involving heinous crimes against women, and we have sought the maximum sentencing.\" Watch India Pakistan Breaking News on CNN-News18.

            "text": "Mumbai Weather Update: Unseasonal rain surprised Mumbaikars on Tuesday morning, with several parts of the city and its suburbs experiencing sudden showers. Areas like Thakur Village in Kandivali (East) were among the first to receive rainfall, catching many pedestrians off guard during their morning commute. Rain was witnessed in other suburban areas such as Kandivali and Goregaon, offering a brief respite from the summer heat. Areas of Vikhroli and Powai witnessed a sudden heavy spell, and intense rainfall was recorded across key western suburbs, including Andheri, Jogeshwari, Goregaon, Malad, Kandivali, Vile Parle, and Santacruz, with residents taking to social media to report waterlogging and traffic disruptions. Light rain and drizzling were reported from Kalyan and Thane. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for Mumbai, warning of partly cloudy skies along with the possibility of thunderstorms, light to moderate rainfall, and gusty winds at isolated locations over the next 48 hours. Despite the showers, temperatures are expected to stay high. The maximum temperature will likely be around 35\u00b0C, while the minimum may be near 26\u00b0C, according to the IMD. An X user, Mumbai Rains, famous for sharing weather updates of the financial capital, shared visuals of the waterlogged road in Sakinaka and said it raises serious concerns about Mumbai\u2019s readiness for monsoon.

            "text": "India\u2019s Operation Sindoor and Pakistan\u2019s futile attempts to escalate tensions by using drones and missiles against India have once again exposed the critical vulnerabilities in Pakistan\u2019s defence infrastructure which has become dependent on Chinese military hardware. A glaring issue is the ineffectiveness of Chinese air defence systems against stealth and precision attacks. The HQ-9B, marketed as a Patriot equivalent, and the HQ-16, failed to intercept Indian SCALP stealth cruise missiles and HAMMER glide bombs. These systems struggle with detecting low-altitude, terrain-hugging threats due to limited detection ranges and susceptibility to jamming. Pakistan\u2019s air defence also lacks redundancy and layered coordination, which Indian SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses) tactics exploited by targeting radar nodes, crippling the entire network. Additionally, Pakistan\u2019s fighter jets, reliant on pre-programmed flight paths, are outmatched by Indian technology, making them predictable targets. A significant 81 per cent of Pakistan\u2019s arms imports come from China, creating a dependency without diversification. China\u2019s refusal to share cutting-edge technology, such as the J-20 stealth fighters, has left Pakistan with outdated systems, while India\u2019s mix of Russian, Western, and homegrown technology has reduced its dependency risks and enhanced adaptability. Sources indicate that Chinese systems sold to Pakistan are downgraded. For instance, the HQ-9P has a 125 km range compared to China\u2019s domestic HQ-9B, which has a range of 250-300 km. A Pakistani LY-80 radar system in Gujranwala was destroyed by Indian Harop loitering munitions due to poor mobility and counter-drone capabilities. Pakistani pilots, trained on simulators, struggled with real-world combat scenarios, unlike India\u2019s Rafale pilots who trained in France. The operational inflexibility and integration flaws of Chinese arms exports to Pakistan, despite their cost-effectiveness, falter against India\u2019s technologically superior, diversified, and well-integrated defence architecture.

            "title": "What If A Supersonic Missile Hits A Nuclear Weapons Storage Facility? | Explained",
            "text": "In a scenario that remains purely hypothetical but has sparked considerable curiosity amid the India-Pakistan conflict, questions arise about the potential impact of a supersonic cruise missile striking a nuclear weapon storage facility. While no such incident has ever occurred, News18 explores whether such an attack could trigger a nuclear explosion, cause the release of radioactive material or lead to other catastrophic consequences. Nuclear weapons are stored in highly secure, hardened underground bunkers or Special Weapons Storage Areas (SWSA). These facilities feature thick walls, often four to five meters thick, and blast-proof doors. They are built deep underground with multiple layers of security. Key security measures include: Reinforced Storage: Each nuclear weapon is stored in a reinforced, steel-lined vault. Publicly available information on the location of Pakistan\u2019s nuclear weapons is largely based on expert analysis and reports published in the media. According to these sources, Pakistan is believed to store its nuclear arsenal at four key locations: Masroor Airbase (near Karachi): Home to Mirage III and V squadrons, this base is suspected to have underground storage facilities in its vicinity. Sargodha Garrison: Considered a major site for missile and weapon storage, it is also believed to support F-16 aircraft capable of delivering nuclear payloads. Bholari Airbase (Sindh): A relatively new airbase where unusually high security measures have been observed, suggesting it may serve as a nuclear storage site. Underground Facility in Balochistan: An underground complex in this region has been identified as a possible storage site for missiles and nuclear weapons. It\u2019s worth noting that like other nuclear-armed nations, Pakistan is believed to disperse its nuclear assets across multiple locations. This strategy enhances security and enables a rapid response in case of a potential threat. India\u2019s BrahMos is one of the world\u2019s most effective supersonic cruise missiles, capable of reaching speeds of Mach 2.8 to 3.0, which is nearly three times the speed of sound. (1 Mach equals approximately 1,234.8 km/h.) It can carry a high-explosive warhead weighing between 200 and 300 kilograms and strike targets at ranges between 300 and 800 kilometres. Upon impact, the missile causes massive destruction, due to its explosive payload and the immense kinetic energy generated by its high speed. Nuclear weapons are typically stored in highly secure facilities known as Hardened Underground Bunkers or Special Weapons Storage Areas (SWSA). Even if a high-explosive missile were to strike such a site, it would not trigger a nuclear explosion. This is because nuclear bombs cannot be detonated by a conventional explosion alone. Their activation requires a precise sequence of electronic commands and secure detonation codes. Multiple layers of safety interlocks are in place to prevent accidental or unauthorized detonation. As a result, even in the event of a direct missile hit, the most likely outcomes would be structural damage and a potential radioactive leak, not a nuclear blast. If a missile strike is forceful enough to breach the protective casing of a nuclear weapon and release its radioactive material, the impact could resemble that of a \u2018dirty bomb\u2019. In such a scenario, the surrounding area would become contaminated with radioactive particles, posing serious long-term health risks to humans and causing environmental damage. Immediate evacuation of the area would be necessary. If a nuclear storage site is targeted with a high-penetration bunker buster or a thermobaric weapon\u2014designed to explode deep underground it could cause significant structural damage and increase the risk of radioactive leakage and contamination. However, even in such a case, a nuclear explosion would not occur. This is precisely why storage facilities around the world are built at great depths and with multiple layers of protection to withstand such high-impact attacks. Control Of Nuclear Assets: It manages all nuclear weapons, including their associated delivery systems such as missiles, bombers, and submarines. Security And Storage: Ensures nuclear weapons are stored in secure locations, maintaining their safety and readiness for deployment during a threat. Launch Authorisation: The command is responsible for issuing orders to launch or withhold a nuclear strike during wartime or in an emergency situation. Rapid Response: It maintains a system to quickly respond to an enemy attack or nuclear threat, ensuring swift action when required. Soviet Union (1986): In Severomorsk, a fire broke out in a nuclear missile storage facility, accidentally destroying 16 missiles that were carrying nuclear warheads. While no nuclear explosion occurred, the fire caused significant damage to the facility and resulted in radioactive leakage. United States (2007): Six nuclear warheads were mistakenly loaded onto a B-52 bomber at Minot Air Force Base without proper clearance. The bomber then flew 1,500 kilometres to another airbase, carrying the warheads without anyone being aware of the mistake for several hours."

            "title": "'India Will Never Negotiate...': Shashi Tharoor On Why Trump's Kashmir Mediation Claim Is 'Disappointing'",
            "text": "Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Monday expressed disappointment at US President Donald Trump\u2019s post on the announcement of halting military hostilities between India and Pakistan, saying, the narrative offers Pakistan a negotiating framework which it certainly has not earned. Tharoor also opined that Trump making such an announcement \u201cis disappointing for India in four important ways\", as it \u201cinternationalises\" the Kashmir dispute, which is an obvious objective of the terrorists. India has never requested, nor is likely to seek, any foreign country\u2019s mediation over its problems with Pakistan, the Congress leader said. \u201cMr Trump\u2019s post is disappointing for India in four important ways,\" Tharoor wrote on X. \u201cFirst, it implies a false equivalence between the victim and the perpetrator, and seemingly overlooks the US\u2019 own past unwavering stance against Pakistan\u2019s well-documented links to cross-border terrorism.\" \u201cSecond, it offers Pakistan a negotiating framework which it certainly has not earned. India will never negotiate with a terrorist gun pointed at its head,\" he wrote. \u201cThird, it \u201cinternationalises\" the Kashmir dispute, an obvious objective of the terrorists. India rejects the idea of a dispute and sees the problem as an internal affair of India\u2019s. India has never requested, not is likely to seek, any foreign country\u2019s mediation over its problems with Pakistan,\" Tharoor wrote. \u201cAnd fourth, it \u201cre-hyphenates\" India and Pakistan in the global imagination,\" he added. \u201cFor decades now, world leaders had been encouraged not to club their visits to India with visits to Pakistan, and starting with President Clinton in 2000, no US President had done so. This is a major backward step,\" Shashi Tharoor further wrote on X. The decision by India and Pakistan was first made public by Trump in a social media post, wherein he claimed that the talks between the two sides were mediated by the United States. Also speaking to news agency PTI on Trump making the announcement, Tharoor on Monday said the announcement was being seen as \u201ca politician wanting to take credit for something\". Tharoor also pointed out that the US President tried to make a \u201cfalse equivalence\" between India and Pakistan and said it was equating the victim with the perpetrator, which was \u201cshocking\". \u201cI see it as a particular politician wanting to take credit for something and I can see that the government of India probably said \u2018let them take the credit if they want to\u2019, but from our point of view we have made it clear that the peace followed a request from the DGMO of Pakistan who called his Indian counterpart at 3.35 pm (Saturday) and we did not take very long to say yes because we had never wanted a long war,\" Tharoor said. \u201cWe had made it very clear on May 7 that what we had done was to strike terrorist targets in reprisal for Pahalgam, and the last thing that we wanted to see was the beginning of a long, protracted conflict,\" he added. \u201cWe had said at every stage, we had done our thing, we have sent a message, if you react, we will react,\" the MP from Thiruvananthapuram said. Tharoor also said the tension between India and Pakistan is not new. \u201cIf we look back at the developments of the last decade, I think the last straw was the Pathankot attack\u2026 when the Prime Minister very graciously invited the Pakistanis to participate in the investigation into the attack. And they sent their intelligence people to an Indian airbase \u2014 something that had never happened before. They went back and said the Indians did it to themselves, that I think was the last straw.\" \u201cThat\u2019s when the Prime Minister felt, and the Government of India concluded, that you could never really trust the Pakistani military establishment and that entire apparatus there,\" he said. \u201cSo, if you look back at where things stood even before Pahalgam, it was not a very warm relationship. After Pahalgam, it\u2019s taken a further dive \u2014 because, as you know, we\u2019ve suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, we have reduced the number of personnel in the embassy here, in the High Commission, we have removed defence attaches,\" he said. \u201cFor three-four days, we were shooting at each other, which was a very serious matter, which seems to have been brought to a halt right now. I hope it stays that way, but even then peace in this case is just the absence of war,\" Tharoor said. Watch India Pakistan Breaking News on CNN-News18.

            "text": "At least three Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists were killed in Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s Shopian following an encounter with security forces. The encounter initially began in the neighboring Kulgam district before the terrorists moved to Shopian. Joint teams of the Indian Army and paramilitary forces were engaged in the operation to neutralize the terrorists. Army sources told CNN-News18 that two of the three terrorists were from LeT \u2013 Shahid Ahmed Kuttay and Adnan Shafi- while the third one was a Pakistani terrorist. Shahid Kuttay was involved in the firing incident at Danish Resort on April 08, 2024 in which two German tourists, and one driver were injured. He was involved in the killing of BJP Sarpanch at Heerpora, Shopian on May 18, 2024 and is suspected involved in the killing of TA Personnel at Behibagh, Kulgam on Feb 03, 2025. Adnan Shafi was involved in the killing of non local labourers at Wachi, Shopian on Oct 18, 2024. The encounter comes in the aftermath of Operation Sindoor- India\u2019s retaliatory counterstrike following the devastating terror attack in Pahalgam, where 26 innocent civilians were brutally murdered by terrorists. In response, India launched airstrikes targeting terror infrastructure within Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir. In his address to the nation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Operation Sindoor has carved out a new benchmark in India\u2019s fight against terrorism . He said, \u201cWe will give a befitting response on our terms only. We will take strict action at every place from where the roots of terrorism emerge. Secondly, India will not tolerate any nuclear blackmail. India will strike precisely and decisively at the terrorist hideouts developing under the cover of nuclear blackmail. Thirdly, we will not differentiate between the government sponsoring terrorism and the masterminds of terrorism.\""

Allahabadia exposed Pakistan\u2019s terrorism links and said the nation has become the terror hub of the world. He defended India\u2019s retaliatory actions in the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack as \u201cprecision-oriented, moderated, and a retaliation\". India has never been \u201can aggressor in any of these situations\", the podcaster pointed out.

No statement. No outrage. No cry for sympathy. Just a private X account and a steady hand on India\u2019s foreign policy wheel. Misri\u2019s diplomatic service is marked by critical and crucial postings, including Ambassador to China during the Doklam and Galwan crises.

As noise escalated online, the real India\u2014its steel frame of governance\u2014stood firmly with him. Senior diplomats, his peers and batchmates from across services, IAS and IPS associations, political leaders across parties, and foreign policy veterans issued open endorsements of Misri\u2019s work ethic and credibility, debunking the social media narrative built against him. In a statement, the IAS association said, \u201cThe IAS Association stands in solidarity with Shri Vikram Misri, Foreign Secretary, and his family. Unwarranted personal attacks on civil servants performing their duties with integrity are deeply regrettable. We reaffirm our commitment to uphold the dignity of public service.\" In a similar statement, the IPS association said, \u201cWe unequivocally condemn the deplorable personal attacks against Foreign Secretary Shri Vikram Misri and his family. Such unwarranted assaults on civil servants committed to their duties are absolutely intolerable. We commend his unwavering service to the nation and reaffirm our resolute commitment to safeguarding the dignity of public service.\" A career diplomat of 1989 IFS batch and with nearly four decades of experience, Misri\u2019s journey reflects quiet continuity\u2014across governments, geographies, and multiple geopolitical crises. Appointed India\u2019s 35th foreign secretary in 2024, Misri stepped into the role in the middle of the rising diplomatic stakes and turbulent geo-political winds. \u201cYou don\u2019t measure a diplomat by hashtags,\" said a senior IFS officer who worked with Misri. \u201cYou measure him by what the world hears and doesn\u2019t. It is just because of his work. He stands tall literally as one of the sharp and erudite foreign service officers the country has got,\" added the senior officer. Misri\u2019s career is built not on headline moments but on inflection points, which include crisis negotiations, boundary diplomacy, several discreet backchannel dialogues, and tireless but powerful briefings in corridors of power. He was in the room when the Gujral doctrine took shape. He drafted cables during the Indo-US nuclear thaw. And he was at the centre of India\u2019s most delicate bilateral relationship with China, as India\u2019s ambassador, during its most hostile phase. In many ways, Misri is emblematic of a vanishing kind of civil service officer who absorbs pressure, speaks less, and delivers more, said his batchmate, and a senior IPS officer. \u201cHis silence in the face of slander is not his weakness, it is his discipline and resilience that taught the officers to follow protocol,\" he added.

Singh said the Delhi government has set a target to complete the road by December as the construction work is progressing rapidly, and the remaining tasks will be completed within the set timeline. The Barapullah Phase-3 project will connect Mayur Vihar Phase-I in East Delhi with AIIMS in South Delhi. It will integrate with the existing Barapullah corridor near Sarai Kale Khan, significantly improving east-west connectivity and reducing travel time across the capital. This project will ease traffic congestion and improve daily commuting for thousands of citizens. \u201cOur target is to operationalise this flyover by December 2025. It is an important infrastructure project for Delhi, which has suffered from neglect and inaction for several years. Since taking charge, we have prioritised this project and ensured progress on multiple fronts,\" Singh said. Speaking about the reason for the delay, Singh blamed the previous AAP government in Delhi. \u201cThe earlier government did not release payments to contractors on time, nor did they initiate the process of tree relocation. As a result, this critical project was delayed for years, with escalated costs. We are actively working to complete the remaining work soon,\" he said. He added that under the current government, there has been active coordination with the forest department to obtain the necessary clearances for tree relocation. \u201cWe are hopeful that the required approvals from the forest department will be received soon, allowing the final phase of construction to commence,\" the minister added. Singh also said for his government, it is not just a project, \u201cbut a significant step in the development of Delhi\". \u201cOur priority is to ensure no project suffers from red tape or neglect, and all pending infrastructure projects are completed on time,\" he said. Once completed, the Barapullah Phase-3 flyover will provide improved and faster connectivity between east and south Delhi, contributing to a cleaner, faster, and more efficient transport system in the capital."

Affected areas include Belapur, Nerul, Vashi, Turbhe, Sanpada, Koparkhairane, Ghansoli, and Airoli. Additionally, there will be no tap water supply to CIDCO-administered areas such as Kharghar and Kamothe during this time.

            "text": "There was no reference to trade in talks between top leaders of India and the US during the India-Pakistan military conflict, government sources said on Monday after American President Donald Trump claimed that he pressured New Delhi and Islamabad to stop hostilities by threatening to cut trade with both countries. US Vice President JD Vance spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on May 9 but there was no reference to trade in the conversation, the sources said. \u201cSecretary of State Marco Rubio spoke to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on May 8 and May 10 and to NSA (National Security Advisor) Ajit Doval on May 10. There was no reference to trade in any of these discussions,\" they said. The source-based clarification came after Trump on Monday said he forced the two countries to stop the hostilities by using the trade card. \u201cI said, \u2018Come on, we\u2019re going to do a lot of trade with you guys. Let\u2019s stop it. Let\u2019s stop it. If you stop it, we\u2019re doing trade. If you don\u2019t stop it, we\u2019re not going to do any trade\u2019,\" Trump said at a press conference in the White House. The US president\u2019s remarks came at a time India and the US are engaged in negotiations to firm up an ambitious trade deal. In his remarks, Trump added, \u201cPeople have never really used trade the way I used it, that I can tell you. And all of a sudden they (India and Pakistan) said, \u2018I think we\u2019re going to stop.'\" \u201cAnd they have, and they did it for a lot of reasons, but trade is a big one. We\u2019re going to do a lot of trade with Pakistan. We\u2019re going to do a lot of trade with India,\" he said. \u201cWe\u2019re negotiating with India right now. We\u2019re going to be soon negotiating with Pakistan, and we stopped a nuclear conflict,\" Trump claimed. The US president again claimed that his administration helped broker what he described as a \u201cfull and immediate ceasefire\" between India and Pakistan. \u201cOn Saturday, my administration helped broker a full and immediate ceasefire, I think, a permanent one, between India and Pakistan, ending a dangerous conflict between two nations with lots of nuclear weapons,\" Trump said. India and Pakistan reached an understanding on Saturday to end the conflict after four days of intense cross-border drone and missile strikes. Indian government sources have been maintaining that the Director Generals of Military Operations (DGMOs) of India and Pakistan reached the understanding to stop all firings and military actions and no third party was involved.

            "text": "The premium OTT content fell by 12 per cent in 2024 as streaming platforms cut back on expensive productions in a bid to become profitable, according to a new report by EY and FICCI. The report also highlighted that 2025 is likely to see significant cost pressures on OTT content, as Pay TV homes continue to decline, and platforms struggle to manage their business models sustainably. It said, \"2024 saw a 12 per cent fall in premium OTT content, and 2025 is expected to see significant pressure on costs as well, as Pay TV homes continue to decline, and OTT platforms struggle for profitability.\" It also noted that the premium OTT content volumes declined as platforms reduced their budgets, focusing more on efficiency than scale. Only 60 films were released directly on digital platforms during the year, even though around 500 films were eventually released on OTT platforms. This suggests that most films still prefer theatrical releases before moving online. In total, more than 1,600 films were released in 2024, excluding around 200 dubbed versions. This marks an increase of 64 films compared to 2023, reflecting a slight recovery in the film industry. The report also pointed out that 48 per cent of the content released on OTT platforms was in regional languages, showing a rising trend of dubbed and sub-titled content to reach wider audiences. General Entertainment Channels (GECs) continued to dominate television content consumption, contributing 65 per cent of total hours watched on TV in 2024, excluding news bulletins. Looking ahead, the report projects that while OTT content volumes are expected to grow in 2025, they will likely come at a lower average cost of production. Streaming platforms are expected to focus on cost-effective content as they aim to balance growth with financial viability. It said, \"In 2025, we expect OTT content volumes to increase, but at a lower average cost of production.\" By 2030, large screens are expected to cross 200 million, while small screens like smartphones are projected to reach almost 700 million. This expanding digital infrastructure is expected to support a growing base of content consumers. The report outlined that the subscribing households are likely to grow from 47 million to over 65 million by 2027, driven by rising per capita income, greater smart TV penetration, and availability of low-cost broadband."

            "title": "Rural accounts for 10-12% of our sales; we are gradually expanding into rural areas: Kia India",
            "text": "The Indian automobile industry is seeing a rising demand for SUVs. The desire to own bigger cars has caught on in rural areas as well. This has resulted in a slew of SUV launches. Kia India, which boasts 10-12 per cent of its sales from the rural markets is expanding its reach among rural customers. The car maker, which recently launched the spacious Carens Clavis, is expecting a 6 per cent overall growth in CY25. businessline spoke to Hardeep Singh Brar, National Head of Marketing & Sales, Kia India, on the growth plans, introduction of its electric vehicle, rural growth and increase in exports. Edited excerpts: What will be the growth projection for Kia India in CY25? Last year, we sold nearly 2,50,000 units. This year, we plan to reach about 300,000 units, targeting roughly 6 per cent growth. Additionally, we aim to increase our market share by 1 per cent, bringing it to approximately 7 per cent by year-end. Companies across sectors have pointed to a slowdown in urban areas. How do you see the Indian automobile market in CY25? Yes, there\u2019s an urban slowdown. Rural markets are growing faster, partly because urban infrastructure (like roads) isn\u2019t keeping pace. We expect the industry to grow 2\u20133 per cent this year. Growth in the first four months has been 3 per cent, and we expect this to continue. With rural areas outperforming urban areas, has Kia India\u2019s sales seen a demand uptick? What percentage of the company\u2019s sales are from rural areas? Rural markets account for about 10-12 per cent of our sales, with the majority (85-90 per cent) coming from urban areas. However, we are gradually expanding into rural areas as more rural customers aspire to own larger vehicles, like SUVs. This growing interest in bigger cars presents a promising opportunity for us to tap into and increase our presence in these markets. We are focusing on expanding into smaller markets, as they offer stronger growth potential compared to larger towns, which are becoming stagnant. Currently, we have around 490 showrooms and aim to reach 500 by year-end. Additionally, we plan to broaden our presence from 300 cities to about 350 cities, significantly increasing our market footprint this year. With the new launches, will Kia India ramp up capacity? This year, we aim to sell 300,000 units domestically and 25,000\u201330,000 units for exports. Our current facility can handle up to 400,000 units, ensuring sufficient capacity to meet both domestic and international demand without strain. You have earlier spoken of the price parity between electric vehicles and internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. With battery prices declining, how do you foresee the prices? Yes, we anticipate the price gap between petrol/diesel vehicles, and electric vehicles will continue to narrow as battery prices fall. We are still finalising the EV pricing details; we will share the same on the launch. When will Kia launch the Clavis EV, a mass market EV? The Clavis EV will be announced soon. It will be the first seven-seater EV in the market, and customers are highly anticipating it. What consequences do you see for the Indian automobile industry with tariffs and geopolitical tensions? There was uncertainty when tariffs were announced, but they\u2019re paused for 90 days. India is in a better position compared to the rest of the world, especially compared to China. Inflation is under control, rate cuts (0.5 per cent) are positive, and tax rationalisation in the last Budget is another positive. Layoffs seem to be behind, but hiring hasn\u2019t picked up yet. Moreover, rural demand is strong, and a good monsoon is expected, making the outlook positive. What new geographies is KIA India looking to ramp up exports from India? We currently export to 100 countries and have a strong presence. We plan to strengthen its position further, especially in right-hand-drive markets.

In a stock exchange filing, it said revenue from operations grew 7.29 per cent y-o-y at \u20b92,704.03 crore for Q4FY25 against \u20b92,520.28 crore for Q4FY24. During the period under review, its total expenses rose 4.68 per cent y-o-y at \u20b92,380.55 crore, whereas cost of material consumed witnessed a 5.35 per cent y-o-y rise at \u20b91,393.22 crore during the period. EBITDA (excluding Other Income) for the fourth quarter was \u20b9427.8 crore against \u20b9350.9 crore in the corresponding quarter of the last financial year, registering a y-o-y increase of 21.9 per cent. \u201cThe tough market conditions continued into the fourth quarter with muted urban demand and increased competition intensity. In spite of this we were able to deliver high single digit volume growth, with sequential improvement in value performance with reduced gap between volume -value growth gap supported by easing impact of Q4FY24 price reductions and momentum in the premium emulsion category. The visible improvement in the industrial and decorative segments were good indicators of a demand improvement cycle,\u201d said Abhijit Roy, Managing Director & CEO, Berger Paints India. Roy said operating margin remained within the guided range, aided by improved gross margin and disciplined cost management. \u201cQ4FY25 saw the company achieve the highest gross margin percentage in the past 12 quarters. EBIDTA for the quarter saw a strong improvement and we are happy to report that we are currently at zero gross debt and have further improved our net cash position at the end of the quarter,\u201d he said. On the international front, the paint maker\u2019s operations in Poland and Nepal saw good topline performances with the Nepal operations seeing a turnaround on the back of improved business conditions and a low base. On Wednesday, Berger Paints scrip ended the day at Rs 553.80 apiece on BSE, up 2.02 per cent from the previous close."

These unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) served multiple purposes: some acted as decoys to strain India\u2019s military resources, including costly air-defence systems and counter-UAV capabilities; others were used to pinpoint locations of Indian air-defence assets. India, however, was prepared with a multi-layered air defence system comprising missiles, drones, smart ammunition, and counter-drone technologies, largely indigenous. As Pakistan launched 300-400 drones daily, India\u2019s home-grown military arsenal was heavily utilised, prompting manufacturers to accelerate supplies. The Central government directed missile and drone system providers to fast-track deliveries to counter the enemy\u2019s aerial assault. Shivaraman Ramaswamy, Co-founder and CTO of deep-tech defence start-up Big Bang Boom Solutions, noted that the conflict highlighted vulnerabilities, emphasising the critical need for large-scale deployment of counter-drone systems. Since May 7, following the Armed Forces\u2019 strikes on 9 terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK), key defence Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) like BDL and BEL, along with private players such as Tata Advanced Systems Ltd (TASL), L&T, Bharat Forge, and Adani Defence and Aerospace, ramped up production and delivery of platforms, systems, and equipment. Their contributions facilitated the seamless integration of advanced weaponry, enhancing stealth, firepower, and a robust air defence architecture that supported the offensive. Companies worked overtime to meet the urgent demands of the armed forces. Santosh Balajee, Founder & CEO of Zebu, stated that the recent escalation significantly increased demand for their advanced aerial systems, crucial for national security and tactical preparedness. He added that their teams were working continuously to meet these urgent needs. The widely-discussed Akash missile systems\u2019 launchers were jointly developed by L&T and TASL in collaboration with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). These include mobile solutions for both the IAF and the Indian Army to intercept medium-range projectiles. L&T sources confirmed the deployment of their Medium Range Surface-to-Air Missile (MRSAM) launchers in the military action. Additionally, TASL\u2019s kinetic systems, including loitering munitions, were deployed for precision strikes. Ammunition for rocket systems was supplied by State-owned Munitions India Ltd and private companies like Solar Industries, sources revealed. UAVs played a pivotal role in the asymmetric offensive between the two nations \u2013 a trend first observed in the Russia-Ukraine war and subsequent global conflicts, including the Israel-Hamas conflict. The strikes on key Pakistani airbases \u2013 Nur Khan and Rahim Yar Khan \u2013 were facilitated by loitering munitions and kamikaze drones, which effectively located and destroyed high-value targets, including enemy radar and missile systems. Sources indicated that indigenous companies such as Adani, Sagar Defence Engineering Pvt Ltd, and Idea Forge offered drones with diverse capabilities for surveillance, reconnaissance, and combat. Sources confirmed that multiple platforms were deployed in Operation Sindoor, including Adani Group-owned firm\u2019s Sky Strikers and loitering munition UAV-Launched Precision Guided Missiles (ULPGMs). Counter-drone systems developed by the DRDO, MSMEs, and start-ups like Chennai-based Big Bang Boom Solutions and Zen Technologies were also employed to neutralise incoming aerial threats. BEL announced the battlefield success of their indigenously-designed and manufactured Akashteer AD System. \u201cGround-based defence systems integrated with Akashteer made it hell for Pakistan\u2019s air adventure,\u201d the PSU stated on \u2018X\u2019."

He added, \u201cThe working capital will swing back in Q1. In terms of volumes, we have pushed really hard in Q4 to make sure we met our commitments. We also deliberately pushed more vehicles through the import structure in the US to get them to dealers before any tariff effect came in. This was an acceleration in sales that we would have done in this quarter.\u201d In the March quarter JLR reported its tenth consecutive profitable quarter, with net cash at \u00a3278 million, with gross debt of \u00a34.4 billion. JLR achieved its net cash positive target and had a free cash flow of \u00a31.5 billion for FY25. It reported a cash balance of \u00a34.6 billion. The revenue during the quarter was down by 1.7 per cent at \u00a37.7 billion. JLR implemented a series of short-term actions to address the immediate impact of trade tariffs introduced by the US administration on the global automotive sector in April 2025. While JLR is yet to assess and determine the impact of the trade agreements in the UK and the US, it is anticipating the UK market to come back strong this year, while the demand in the Chinese luxury car market continues to be low. \u201cWe have a fairly balanced global spread of sales between six regions, and we do not anticipate a massive change in that. Europe, particularly Germany, is quite strong for us, and we see the UK recovering and rising. The Chinese market is tough for everybody, and we are seeing at least a slowdown in the rate of dealers leaving the premium western segment and are moving to a scenario where we are looking to fill the distribution hole. We are focused on not overstocking the retailers in China. We have kept days of supply at the retailers and will manage it carefully.

The company recently sold its data centre business, Web Werks, to global data and information management company Iron Mountain in a \u20b91,400 crore deal. Nishant Rathi, the company\u2019s Founder, explained, \u201cWe are building a cloud infrastructure business, incubated under NeoSOFT with the brand name NeoNXT. We plan to keep it as a separate entity. NeoSOFT has a decentralised DevOps practice and works across AWS, Azure, GCP, and native cloud platforms. Previously, we only handled consulting while our data centre business handled infrastructure deployment. With NeoNXT, we aim to build our own public and private cloud platforms while supporting current public cloud platforms.\u201d He added that clients in India, the Middle East, the US, and elsewhere increasingly want data hosted within their countries. NeoNXT differentiates itself from major cloud companies with better pricing, superior support, and localised data hosting. \u201cPersonalised support is lacking with larger cloud providers. In our model, clients work directly with the digital infrastructure provider, with NeoSOFT consulting and managing the transition and scale-up. Our consultative approach, migration support, and long-term planning give us a competitive edge,\u201d Rathi noted. Data sovereignty is increasingly mandated by governments, with India also mandating banks and insurance companies to keep all data within the country. The same applies to government platforms like the MeitY cloud. India is also investing in self-sustaining systems to reduce dependence on external players during geopolitical tensions. \u201cThat\u2019s the premise behind our cloud platform,\u201d said Rathi. The Founder also mentioned that the company collaborates with several Indian PSUs and government agencies. At present, it operates in 7\u20138 States, with plans to expand its reach further. In the first year, the company will focus on building infrastructure and onboarding anchor clients, with government contracts expected to become a key revenue driver by the second and third years. NeoNXT has a dedicated team in place, which it plans to scale up to 250 members by the end of the year. Headquartered in Mumbai, the company is also eyeing a public listing via an IPO within the next two to three years. It is targeting 30 per cent year-on-year growth with stable or improving margins and is actively exploring acquisitions in India, Eastern Europe, and Africa to strengthen its capabilities and expand its footprint. Currently, NeoSOFT has nine delivery centers across India\u2014Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Indore, Noida, Chennai\u2014with offices in Dubai, the US, and Europe. While it primarily serves customers in India, it has a market presence in North America, the Middle East, and Europe. We have migrated to a new commenting platform.

The recent flare-up has triggered a renewed emphasis on indigenous capabilities, with a clear policy-level push for private players to fast-track innovation and deployment. Firms such as Big Bang Boom Solutions, Kepler, and Zebu Intelligent Systems are at the forefront of this shift, building technologies that span the entire drone warfare spectrum \u2014 from detection and jamming to active neutralisation. The segment has cumulatively raised over $40 million since 2019, according to industry estimates. \u201cThe current conflict has been quite enlightening,\u201d said Shivaraman Ramaswamy, co-founder and CTO of Big Bang Boom Solutions. \u201cIt\u2019s also exposed the vulnerabilities in the system, and people are realising that a large-scale deployment of counter-drone systems is essential for us to thrive as a country.\u201d Big Bang Boom has developed modular systems that support both drone and counter-drone operations. The company is also exploring indirect partnerships with government agencies to expand deployment. \u201cTraditional legacy systems are increasingly being challenged by low-cost drones \u2014 often costing just a few thousand dollars\u2014 that are capable of inflicting serious damage on high-value assets like tanks and aircraft worth millions,\u201d Ramaswamy said. \u201cThis shift underscores the growing preference for smarter, faster, and more distributed systems over large, expensive machines.\u201d Zebu Intelligent Systems is also seeing traction for its integrated drone warfare solutions. The Hyderabad-based firm raised $1 million in venture capital last year to scale operations and is currently working with frontline defence units, as well as exploring collaborations to scale its footprint. \u201cLow-cost drones are already redefining warfare,\u201d said a company executive. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on building systems that are smarter and modular, and can be quickly adapted to new threats.\u201d Even global figures like Elon Musk have pointed to autonomous drones as the future of warfare \u2014 an outlook India\u2019s emerging defence-tech sector appears to be aligned with. From an investment standpoint, the space is gaining momentum. \u201cToday we are seeing start-ups working on complex technologies in Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicles, Unmanned-Ground-Vehicles, Unmanned-Underwater-Vehicles, propulsion systems, tracking and guidance, electronic warfare, gas turbines, materials and many more,\u201d said Manu Iyer, General Partner, Bluehill VC. Multiple larger players in defence today are collaborating with start-ups on projects to offer support on manufacturing scale-up and fulfilling of orders as well. \u201cDefence in general has seen interest from investors, especially after the government opened it up to the private sector and introduced startup-friendly policies,\u201d said Anil Joshi, Managing Partner, Unicorn India Ventures. \u201cWe\u2019ve made two investments\u2014 one in underwater mines and another in payload transport in areas with no RF signals. National security is a priority for every country now, making this a significant opportunity to scale.\u201d With growing investor interest, robust R&D pipelines, and government support through emergency procurement and policy reforms, India\u2019s defence-tech start-ups are well-positioned to become key enablers of next-generation military capability."

            "text": "Women at entry level are 1.3 times more likely to leave their roles than men. | Photo Credit: SoumenNath India\u2019s gender gap in the workplace begins at entry level and widens dramatically at the first promotion, according to new research from McKinsey & Company. The \u201cWomen in the Workplace\u201d study, released on Wednesday, found that women hold just 17 per cent of C-suite positions and 20 per cent of board roles in India\u2019s formal private sector. The report reveals a striking pattern in India\u2019s workplace gender dynamics. Despite women comprising approximately 48 per cent of university graduates, they represent only 33 per cent of entry-level employees in the formal private sector. This gap widens considerably at the manager level, where women\u2019s representation drops to 24 per cent. \u201cGender equity in the workplace is not just a moral or social imperative, it is a strategic one,\u201d said Vivek Pandit, Senior Partner at McKinsey & Company. \u201cAs India sets its sights on becoming a $8 trillion economy by 2035, fully integrating women into the formal workforce is developmentally foundational.\u201d The research identified a \u201cbroken rung\u201d problem unique to India\u2019s workforce. While entry-level representation is low, the most significant drop occurs at the first promotion to manager. Men at entry level are 2.4 times more likely to be promoted to managerial positions than women. Simultaneously, women at entry level are 1.3 times more likely to leave their roles than men. After this critical juncture, the pipeline becomes less leaky. From manager through to C-suite, women\u2019s representation declines gradually, dropping from 24 per cent to 17 per cent across these levels. At Senior Vice President levels, women even outpace men in promotion rates by half a percentage point and show lower attrition rates than their male colleagues. The study also highlights a seven-year age gap at the entry level between women (39 years) and men (32 years), the widest among the three countries studied. This suggests women either start formal employment later or remain in entry-level positions longer before advancing. McKinsey\u2019s research, which drew insights from 324 organisations across India, Nigeria, and Kenya, including 77 private sector organisations from India, identified policies linked to better outcomes for women. Organisations with better gender representation were 34 per cent more likely to offer flexible work options, 33 per cent more likely to have mentorship and sponsorship programs, and 23 per cent more likely to provide family and personal care policies. However, implementation remains a challenge. While 77 per cent of the surveyed organisations report gender diversity as a CEO priority, only 66 per cent track basic metrics like hiring and promotion rates by gender. Just 15 per cent of boards hold accountability for gender equity outcomes. The report recommends a three-part action plan for organisations to address these challenges: diagnose pipeline challenges through regular tracking of hiring, promotions, and attrition by gender; design and implement effective practices prioritising mentorship, sponsorship, and family care; and monitor progress with accountability at board and senior leadership levels. The study also found significant variations across sectors. In India\u2019s legal sector, women comprise 51 per cent of entry-level roles but only 32 per cent at the C-suite. In financial services, women\u2019s representation drops from 31 per cent at entry level to 13 per cent at the C-suite. This research extends McKinsey\u2019s annual Women in the Workplace report, which has tracked women\u2019s representation in corporate America since 2015, to India, Nigeria, and Kenya for the first time."

The company has 10 counsellors who will provide counselling to consumers on the application. It plans to scale it up as consumers join the programme. The mobile application programme is expected to help curb a consumer\u2019s desire to smoke again. \u201cNicotex has been in the market for eight-nine years. We did numerous clinical trials and consumer research and realised that when you get a smoker to consume a product, with general counselling and continuous support, the probability of quitting smoking goes up five times, and we realised that this is an opportunity for us to leverage digital along with the product,\u201d Shivam Puri, MD & CEO, Cipla Health, told businessline. \u201cWe have almost 90 per cent market share in the category, and we believe it is our responsibility. The mobile application is the first of its kind to provide a smoking solution with online therapy. Some consumers quit smoking and then go through a terrible time, as nicotine cravings keep striking them. The application will provide an opportunity for us to keep them within the whole process and ensure adherence.

It\u2019s a very active year for EV launches across OEMs, so we do expect short-term volatility. But with the actions we are planning to take, let me elaborate, we\u2019re confident in sustaining our leadership,\u201d Shailesh Chandra, MD, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd., and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Ltd, said during the Q4FY25 earnings call. \u201cOur aspiration is to maintain a market share of over 50 per cent, he added. As part of this strategy, Tata Motors is focusing on four key segments. In the entry-level segment (under \u20b912 lakh), where it currently commands over 75 per cent market share with models like the Tiago and Punch EV, the company is working to reduce the price gap with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and improve driving range to drive broader adoption. In the highly competitive mid-segment (\u20b912\u201320 lakh), where Tata holds a 30\u201333 per cent share, the company is implementing both short-term initiatives and a strategic 18\u201324 month plan to strengthen its presence, as this segment is expected to contribute the highest EV volumes. In the premium segment (above \u20b920 lakh), which is showing increasing promise, Tata is preparing to launch the Harrier EV and Sierra EV to capture incremental volumes. For the fleet segment, where Tata has focused on offering better total cost of ownership compared to diesel, the company now aims to offer greater value than CNG alternatives to tap into additional market potential. Tata Motors\u2019 electric passenger vehicle (PV) volumes declined by 13 per cent year-on-year to 64,300 units in FY25, primarily due to subdued demand in the fleet segment. As a result, the company\u2019s market share fell from 73.1 per cent in FY24 to 55.4 per cent in FY25, amid intensified competition from new model launches. While growth remained muted in the first half of FY25, the second half saw renewed traction thanks to increased participation from OEMs and a slew of new launches. This bodes well for EV growth in FY26, he said."

            "text": "Government sources had said that the hike of \u20b950 per 14.2 kg LPG cylinder is likely to generate around \u20b910,000 crore in FY26. The government is expected to mop up additional around \u20b933,000 crore due to the \u20b92 per litre hike in the excise duty of key auto fuels\u2014diesel and petrol\u2014last month. \u201cWith the recent increase in excise duty by \u20b92 per litre from April 08, 2025, the government is expected to mop up incremental around \u20b933,000 crore, which can be passed on to OMCs for their LPG under-recoveries in FY26,\u201d said Hardik Shah, Director at CareEdge Ratings. Last month, cooking gas prices were raised by \u20b950 per cylinder and excise duty on petrol and diesel was hiked by \u20b92 a litre to compensate oil marketing companies (OMCs) for the \u20b941,383 crore loss in FY25 due to supplying liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) at below market rates. Government sources had said that the hike of \u20b950 per 14.2 kg LPG cylinder is likely to generate around \u20b910,000 crore in FY26. Shah said that OMCs are expected to experience lower refining margins due to a weak global demand scenario for end products in FY26, while their fuel retailing margins are expected to expand on the back of lower crude oil prices. Besides, pump prices remain largely stable. \u201cLPG under-recoveries are also expected to decline materially in FY26, following the recent price hike per cylinder. At the same time, reduction in LPG under-recoveries in FY26 would also be critically dependent on a reduction in LPG sourcing cost,\u201d he explained. On the April 2025 excise duty hike, CareEdge had said that the government increased excise duty to partly compensate for the reduced profitability of government-owned oil exploration and production (E&P) companies. Crude oil prices experienced a sharp decline in the first week of April 2025 (from $77 a barrel on March 31), following the announcement of reciprocal tariffs by the US, which caused crude prices to fall below $65 a barrel, a sweet spot for OMCs. OMCs faced significant under-recoveries in LPG to the extent of around \u20b9220 per 14.2 kg cylinder in FY25, as the higher LPG sourcing cost could not be passed on to the consumers, CareEdge said. With the recent increase in LPG prices by \u20b950 per cylinder, effective April 8, 2025, the LPG under recoveries are expected to have decreased to around \u20b9170 per cylinder, it added. \u201cFurthermore, anticipated reduction in LPG sourcing cost going forward on the back of decline in crude oil prices as well as higher sourcing of LPG from US is expected to further reduce the LPG under-recoveries in the coming quarters such that aggregate under-recoveries of Indian OMCs could decline by around 45 per cent in FY26 y-o-y,\u201d the ratings agency anticipated. Historically, crude oil price changes have translated into changes in Saudi CP with a lag. While the crude oil price (Indian basket) declined sharply to $67.7 per barrel in April 2025 and further to $61.8 in the first week of May from an average of $78.6 a barrel in FY25, the decline in the Saudi CP is lagging, it added. \u201cAs China imports a large portion of its LPG requirements from the US, the heightened tariff war has led China to explore alternative avenues, including the Middle East. This has prevented the Saudi CP price from declining in line with the recent decline in crude oil prices. This situation has opened up opportunities for India to diversify its LPG purchases from the US which could also help India reduce its trade surplus with the US,\u201d it said.

            "text": "FMCG companies have had to take price hikes during March quarter in response to inflationary pressures. Some companies said that the spillover of these increases is also expected be felt during the June quarter. While food inflation is moderating, experts said that commodities such as copra, palm oil, tea and coffee remain as key monitorables. Overall, consumer companies are hoping for improvement in consumption trends during FY26 due to better macro-economic factors. Speaking at Q4FY25 earnings call, Mohit Malhotra, CEO, Dabur India said the company had taken an average price increase of about 3.5 per cent in the quarter. \u201cWe have taken a price increase of around 4.5- 5 per cent in Health Care. In Personal Care, which is a very competitive category, our price increase was in the range of 1.5 per cent. And in Beverages, our price increase was 1.6 per cent broadly. So overall, it\u2019s around 3.5 per cent sort of a price increase that we\u2019ve taken in Q4FY25, which will flow through to Q1FY26.\u201d India cuts coal imports by 9.2% in Apr\u2013Feb 2025, saving \u20b953,138 cr in forex Malhotra said that with improving macros aided by income tax cuts in the budget, easing food inflation and positive monsoon forecast, the company anticipates business to regain momentum. He added that the company has seen green shoots with moderating food inflation and expects to see gradual sequential improvement going forward. Britannia too has had to take price hikes in the third and fourth quarter of FY25 to mitigate the raw material price inflation. The company\u2019s management said that there will be some \u201cremnants of price increase\u201d which move into the first two months of Q1FY26 but thereafter the way the commodity situation looks, it might not be necessary to take pricing action. However, the packaged food major said that it will depend on how the trends move through the quarter and will take a call based on those trends.

Margins for most players were under pressure due to input cost pressures.\u201d The company stated that it has hiked the prices of products such as Parachute and Saffola Edible oil. \u201cEasing retail and food inflation is encouraging for consumption trends going ahead. In addition, a healthy monsoon season, higher MSPs and continued government spending should support the uptrend in rural growth,\u201d he added.

            "text": "The next six months will be challenging, said Cipla Managing Director and Global Chief Executive Officer Umang Vohra, as the pharmaceutical industry faces several moving parts including tariffs in the US. \u201cEvery week or 10 days we\u2019re solving for something new. It\u2019s just become the way in the world. We were solving for \u2013 first the tariffs...that began to settle down a bit. Then we began to solve for a potential conflict at the border. So we are hoping for calm,\u201d Vohra told businessline, at a post-quarterly-results media interaction. \u201cAs more policy promulgations begin to stabilise, ... the period after six months may have more certainty than the immediate next six months,\u201d he added. Cipla posted a consolidated net profit of \u20b91,222 crore for the three months ended March 31, 2025, up 30 per cent over the same period last year. It clocked a revenue of \u20b96,730 crore, up 9 per cent over last year. The company ended the year with a net profit of \u20b95,273 crore, up 28 per cent; and revenues of \u20b927548 crore, up 8 per cent over last year. Vohra, however, did not give a guidance for the present year, with the many \u201cmoving parts\u201d including the geo-political situation, and tariffs, he said. On the directive from US President Trump on Monday, seeking price cuts on medicines of over 59 per cent, Vohra said, while it was too early to assess the impact, the order was aimed at branded medicines, he added. And as for generic drugs, he said, they were comparable with the US, and possibly lower in some cases. As for the US tariffs expected in a few days, Vohra indicated that affordable generic medicines were unlikely to be impacted, though the company and the industry were monitoring the fast-changing situation. Commenting on the company\u2019s annual performance, Vohra had said in a statement, \u201cIn FY25, we recorded a revenue growth of 8 per cent over last year with the EBITDA margin of 25.9 per cent, driven by mix and other operational efficiencies. Our One-India business grew at a healthy 7 per cent y-o-y (year-on-year). Key therapies in branded prescription business continued to outpace the market growth, trade generics business growth trajectory is back on track and anchor brands of consumer health business maintained leadership position. With a positive traction in our differentiated assets, the US business posted an all-time high annual revenue of $934 Million. In One Africa, we recorded a solid growth of 12 per cent y-o-y in dollar terms, powered by firm performance across key markets. Emerging markets and Europe delivered a substantial revenue growth of 15 per cent y-o-y on the back of deep market focus strategy. Going ahead, the focus will be on growing our key markets, further building our flagship brands, investing in future pipeline as well as focusing on resolutions on the regulatory front\u201d.

            "title": "Demand softness temporary, travel sector will grow by 15% in FY 26: Thomas Cook India CEO & MD, Mahesh Iyer",
            "text": "Thomas Cook India reported a profitable fourth quarter at a pre-tax level, with 19 per cent revenue growth. While net profit reduced year-on-year due to a higher tax outgo, the company is confident of improving its performance in FY 2026, CEO and Managing Director, Mahesh Iyer, tells businessline in an interview Thomas Cook India\u2019s consolidated pre-tax profit grew on a quarterly and annual basis in FY25. What were the main growth drivers? All our business units had a great year, barring our digital imaging solutions business. We had strong growth in our forex business in terms of revenue and profitability, with a 45 per cent EBIT (earning before interest and tax) margin. We expect to have a similar EBIT margin in forex in FY26. In the forex business, our focus has been to address various segments through the pre-paid route. The pre-paid borderless cards have enabled us to grow faster than the market within that segment. On the travel side, the destination management business and National Games (Thomas Cook was travel partner) contributed to growth. The long-haul business also saw higher growth compared to the first quarter of 2024, and it continues to play out in summer as well. We operate in the outbound travel space in Hong Kong and India. In India, the long-haul segment has recovered to 80-85 per cent, but the overall rate is only 68-72 per cent, due to slower recovery in Hong Kong. Visa challenges have been a handicap on the long-haul side. We continue to have challenges, but the situation is better than in 2024. What impact do you see on travel demand post the Pahalgam terror attack? What is the growth guidance for FY26? There has been demand softness for the last two weeks, but I would qualify it as temporary. With the de-escalation and opening of airports, some amount of recovery will happen. We believe there is a booking cycle available to us and there will be some amount of elongation of the travel period from June to July-August. My belief is that the travel industry should grow at 12-15 per cent, and I think we will mirror the industry growth. Multiple destinations have opened up, including Japan, Vietnam and other easy visa destinations, and all these add to our product portfolio. I will not comment on (other companies). There are no cancellation requests, but inquiries have gone down for sure. Today, from a market perspective, there are so many more destinations for people to travel, and as a travel company our job is to make people travel. We had targeted to keep our costs at 40 per cent below the pre-pandemic level for four years and I am happy to report that we have still not reached the 2019 cost base. Benefits from automation, productivity enhancements and common buying (by Thomas Cook and SOTC) are playing out. We follow a cost-to-revenue matrix. Our cost increase will be proportionate to revenue growth. Pre-pandemic our cost-to-revenue ratio used to be closer to 85 per cent. We are now operating at 62-63 per cent. We continue to take tactical and strategic calls regarding marketing, and investments like the recent appointment of actor Kartik Aryan as brand ambassador for our borderless prepaid card. Our balance sheet is strong. We are generating around Rs 200 crore every year, but we are not looking at any acquisitions now.

At the end of the last financial year the company\u2019s revenue from its lead acid business was around \u20b916,500 crore. \u201cAs we enter FY26, the outlook for the lead-acid business remains positive across most business verticals. I believe that Exide with its advanced product portfolio and pan-India distribution network and a strong brand recall will continue to benefit from the growth opportunities,\u201d Roy said during the company\u2019s Q4FY25 earnings call last week. In the fourth quarter last fiscal the company\u2019s standalone revenue from operations grew 3.74 per cent year-on-year to \u20b94,159.42 crore from \u20b94,009.39 crore in corresponding period previous fiscal. The company reported around 10 per cent y-o-y decline in its net profit to \u20b9254.60 crore in Q4FY25, as its margin was impacted due to high raw material prices during the period. The company intends to commercialise the first phase of the lithium-ion cell manufacturing operations in Karnataka this fiscal. The company\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary Exide Energy Solutions (EESL) is setting up a 6 gigawatt-hour lithium-ion cell manufacturing unit in the first phase. So far Exide has invested around \u20b93,600 crore in EESL. \u201cWe have the board approval to invest additional around \u20b91,200 crore in this financial year,\u201d Roy said. Antimony, a key raw material for lead-acid battery, has witnessed an unprecedented price surge, impacting the company\u2019s profitability. \u201cWe implemented a price hike of about 5 per cent to pass on the cost increase. There was a lag between cost escalation and pricing action. Prices stabilised in April. We remain watchful,\u201d the MD added. We have migrated to a new commenting platform.

Neeti Sharma, CEO of TeamLease Digital, noted that AI and machine learning roles saw the fastest growth at 36 per cent in December 2024. \u201cHealth tech, pharma tech and deep tech sectors show stronger recovery with increased funding and headcount expansion,\u201d she added. The most in-demand skills now centre around emerging technologies, with start-ups primarily seeking talent in AI, machine learning, cloud computing and data analytics. \u201cEngineering jobs like software engineers, DevOps engineers and full-stack developers are seeing a 20 per cent increase in demand, especially for those skilled in Docker, Kubernetes and cloud platforms,\u201d Sharma explained. Previous layoffs primarily affected support functions and non-engineering roles, but these positions are largely not being refilled. Instead, companies are restructuring for greater efficiency, partly enabled by AI adoption. \u201cAI has been a game-changer and will continue to make teams more efficient. AI-first opportunities will continue to be lean and mean,\u201d Shivani said, explaining why hiring will remain cautious throughout 2025 despite the recovery. The geographical hiring pattern is also evolving, with more start-ups looking beyond metropolitan areas. \u201cThere is a clear focus at start-ups to hire from beyond metros in order to bring in cognitive diversity,\u201d Sharma observed, noting this approach helps build more inclusive teams while expanding the available talent pool. While metro cities continue to dominate in senior and highly technical roles, start-ups are intentionally widening their reach to build diverse, skilled and agile teams across India and even globally. SaaS and health tech start-ups have demonstrated better workforce retention than sectors like e-commerce, with health tech expecting over 30 per cent hiring growth in 2025, driven by expansion in diagnostics and chronic care management solutions."

The turnaround was largely driven by investment gains in global tech majors including Alibaba, T-Mobile, and Deutsche Telekom. For the full fiscal year ended March 2025, the Japanese conglomerate posted a consolidated net profit of $7.4 billion (\u00a51.15 trillion), a sharp reversal from the $1.47 billion (\u00a5227.6 billion) loss it logged a year earlier.

The Vision Funds segment posted an investment gain of $2.5 billion (\u00a5387.6 billion). This was led by Vision Fund 1, which reported a $6.1 billion (\u00a5940.5 billion) gain ,thanks to rising valuations in companies like ByteDance and Coupang. In contrast, Vision Fund 2 recorded a loss of $3.4 billion (\u00a5526.5 billion) for FY25, mainly due to markdowns in Swiggy, Ola, and other portfolio companies. The group\u2019s fair value of investments held at Q4 decreased by 2.7 per cent sequentially. A $708M loss for public portfolio companies held by its start-up focused Softbank Vision Fund 2 (SVF2), which holds investments in companies like Swiggy and Ola Electric Mobility, contributed to the overall decline. Softbank Vision Fund 1 (SVF1) with exposure to start-ups like Brainbees Solutions Limited (FirstCry) and Delhivery Ltd, performed significantly better with gains of $1.8 billion."

            "text": "Following its organisational rejig and leadership changes, Happiest Minds reported a revenue hike of 31 per cent y-o-y and 2.6 per cent q-o-q to \u20b9545 crore in Q4FY25. The company\u2019s PAT, however, stood at \u20b934 crore, posting a 52.8 per cent y-o-y and 32.1 per cent q-o-q decline. Venkatraman Narayanan, MD & CFO, and Joseph Anantharaju, Co-Chairman and newly appointed CEO, discuss priorities for FY26, which include integrating acquisitions, pursuing private equity, and achieving double-digit growth in the upcoming fiscal year. Venkatraman: We had decent growth but took a small knock on the profitability for the quarter. The primary reason is that we had to take a knock of almost \u20b912.5 crores for a bad debt that came and hit us this quarter. This was a customer for whom we had ramped up to $1.5 million in revenues in Q3. But because of certain problems with their end customers, US government-supported institutions, they stopped funding. We understand this happened under the new dispensation. Since they couldn\u2019t make payments, we stopped work in January, but what we had built in Q3, we wrote, so it had an impact. But if you adjust for that in terms of profitability, we are close to last year; similar at the EBITDA level. Year over year, our EBITDA has grown, which shows that the revenue growth has come with profitability growth. This increase is after the investment of about \u20b940 crore we made in GBS services early this year, and the new sales team we have been putting in place. There is also noise from acquisition costs, non-cash charges, goodwill impairment, and earn-out payments. In PAT, we would have been higher than last year, but those are investments we are making for the longer term and business health. Effectively, the top line has grown both q-o-q and y-o-y. We integrated the companies we acquired early last year, and they are beginning to pull their weight, helping us with growth. We continue to build and invest in our platform, which is showing decent growth and profitability. Last fiscal year was a difficult year. Next year, we are looking at double-digit growth and are holding on to the 20-22 per cent EBITDA guidance from last year. We\u2019ll try to improve in FY26. Joseph: The first one is in the GenAI space. We recognised the potential of this area and formed a separate business unit. This year, we are seeing signs of good growth. We also see green shoots in the BFS segment, along with a few of our other brethren. Our quarter-on-quarter growth is impressive. We have several new opportunities in both the banking and insurance spaces, some of which we are implementing or executing. The Arttha Banking Platform gives us a good direct source of revenue and a wedge into some of the accounts, allowing us to differentiate and show a deeper capability. The third area is healthcare, where some focus is on data-driven patient care, data-driven drug discovery, how to use data and customise the commercialisation process, and bioinformatics. From a geography perspective, our revenues in the Middle East have gone up, and we acquired a few customers during the quarter in the banking space. We have critical mass there, and it should continue growing. In India, despite a drop in this quarter, we exhibited growth and expect it to continue. This year, India\u2019s growth will be higher than Europe or the USA because a lot is happening with GCCs coming in. Joseph: At the end of the day, when half the IT spend either originates or happens in the US, you will have to focus on it and get as much growth as possible. Having said that, in our geowise revenue split, between FY23 and FY25, and between quarters, even though we are growing as a company, the share of the US has been dropping. For instance, in FY24, we were at 70.7 per cent, and down to 64.6 per cent in FY25. In Q4, it\u2019s even lower at 62 per cent. The acquisitions had a larger share of revenues outside of the US, like in Africa, in the case of Pure Software. As a result, there\u2019s a diversification of revenue. We expect that in FY26, the US would be between 61 per cent to 63 per cent, which is a good number. May be we will push the other geos to grow faster, with which the acquisitions and some implemented strategies are helping. Joseph: Verticalisation, creating a GenAI Business Unit, and a separate NN sales team, which was implemented only in the middle of FY25. Many opportunities and closures will be generated by this team. A priority is to ensure momentum in the right direction by providing the required support and investment. We invested \u20b940 crore in these two areas in FY25 and expect them to start yielding results and provide the revenue uplift during the year. The other transformation is my elevation and the integration and creation of the new organisational structure, which is a process underway. The priority for this year will be to integrate the two companies we have acquired. The other three would be around GCCs, pursuing private equity companies and hyper accounts. In the IT services space, it is becoming imperative to have your own platform or solution and to add to the services portfolio. We are enhancing our Arrtha platform. The task force is working on how to take it to the Indian market, which needs a different set of customisation as opposed to the European and North American markets. We are also looking at healthcare as a service platform in the early stages of conceptualisation and are working through the business case and POCs."

            "text": "Equity finance is also gaining ground, especially among medium and small enterprises in growth phases | Photo Credit: SRIRAM MA Despite a steady rise in credit supply, India\u2019s micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector continues to face a significant credit gap, estimated at approximately \u20b930 lakh crore, according to a report by SIDBI (Small Industries Development Bank of India). While traditional lenders struggle to bridge this gap due to challenges such as information asymmetry and lack of collateral, alternative finance is gaining traction as a viable solution. The total finance demand from the MSME sector is pegged at \u20b9123 lakh crore, with debt accounting for around \u20b992 lakh crore, based on an assumed 3:1 debt-equity ratio. Of this, about \u20b964 lakh crore is considered addressable debt demand. However, with banks and NBFCs supplying only \u20b934 lakh crore in formal debt, the remaining \u20b930 lakh crore forms the addressable credit gap, said the report titled \u201cUnderstanding Indian MSME sector: Progress and Challenges. Medium enterprises face the steepest shortfall at 29 per cent, followed by micro and small enterprises. Sector-wise, trading MSMEs face the largest gap at 33 per cent, followed by services (27 per cent) and manufacturing and allied sectors (20 per cent). This is because most of the trading MSMEs face a working capital shortfall due to inability to provide collateral given their business model. Regionally, rural MSMEs encounter a higher credit gap (32 per cent) than urban counterparts (20 per cent) due to fewer financial institutions and lower industrial activity. Female-owned enterprises are particularly disadvantaged, facing a 35 per cent credit gap compared to 20 per cent for male-owned MSMEs, prompting many to rely on informal credit sources. To counter these challenges, alternative and digital lending solutions are emerging as promising alternatives. Fintech companies, in collaboration with traditional banks, are expanding digital lending infrastructure, raising awareness, and pushing for greater financial inclusion. Although only 18 per cent of surveyed MSMEs currently use digital lending platforms, over 90 per cent accept digital payments\u2014highlighting strong readiness for digital finance adoption. Sectors such as hospitality, auto components, pharmaceuticals, and garments, which already exhibit a moderate to high digital presence, offer greater potential for digital credit offtake. Platforms like the Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS), now accessible to more MSMEs due to revised eligibility norms, are further improving access to working capital. Equity finance is also gaining ground, especially among medium and small enterprises in growth phases. These firms are increasingly turning to crowdfunding, venture capital, private equity, and IPOs to meet their capital needs. However, micro enterprises still struggle to access equity funding due to limited early-stage investment avenues. We have migrated to a new commenting platform.

Koushik Chatterjee, executive director and chief financial officer, Tata Steel told businessline that the (SC) judgement pertained to a specific case and the regulation had gone through multiple changes and the government and the IBBI (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India) had worked to make it a lot more efficient. He also ruled out any impact of the judgement on Tata Steel\u2019s acquisition of Bhushan Steel under the bankruptcy laws. \u201cN we did not have this kind of issue (like in JSW case). We had actually gone through two rounds. The first round was when we acquired the asset and then we went through it during the merger process. So it was validated at multiple levels,\u201d he said. In 2018, Tata Steel had acquired Bhushan Steel through its subsidiary Bamnipal Steel under the IBC process by paying \u20b935,200 crore to Bhushan Steel\u2019s creditor banks and an additional \u20b91,200 crore over 12 months to operational creditors. In an unprecedented judgement, the Apex Court earlier this month quashed JSW Steel\u2019s Rs 19,350-crore acquisition of Bhushan Power and Steel and ordered its liquidation. The top court was critical of JSW Steel for using a mix of equity and optionally convertible debentures to complete the takeover instead of pure equity and a failure to implement the plan within the timeframe mandated under the insolvency law. Asked whether Tata Steel will be interested in bidding for BPSL if put on the block again, Chatterjee said a lot of the process still remains to be seen and to see where this (JSW case) leads."

            "text": "PNB has slipped to 3rd largest public sector bank position in Q4FY25. Do you aim to retain your position? We are not in that race. Definitely, we are mindful of growth, and quality growth. We have focused a lot on operating profit. That was one of the concern areas for the bank. We were the second largest State-owned bank in December quarter, but in terms of operating profit, we were at number four position. Even below Union Bank of India and Canara Bank. So whatever needs to be done to improve operating profit is being done. We have shed around\u20b935,000 croreof corporate loans which was giving lower yields. Had we continued with it, we would have beaten other banks. Accordingly, improving operational profit and quality growth would be the focus areas for us in FY26. Core income and margin were muted in Q4FY25. But even FY26 guidance for NII and NIM is lower than FY25... We are cognisant of the various factors playing out in the market. We are moving into a lower interest rate regime now. With two rate cuts till now, net interest income (NII) has dropped and will continue being under pressure. This is because deposit interest rate changes with a lag of 1 year to 18 months, whereas loans, especially those linked to repo rate, reprice immediately after repo rate cut. And going forward , we expect that there will be further rate cuts in FY26, and thus NII and net interest margin (NIM) will be under pressure. That is why we have lowered the guidance on these parameters, but these are conservative estimates, we will cross this guidance, that is our goal. We are putting a lot of focus on cash management services. Especially, in supply chain finance segment as there is a very big market for it in the country now. We have made made a cell in our head office led by a GM for this. We are making tie-up arrangements with large companies and then tapping them for vendor financing and supply chain financing. We will do this activity in a big way. Treasury will also contribute in a big way this fiscal. We are focusing on higher recoveries and recoveries through technically written-off loans. With growth rate of more than 12 per cent in credit, it will also contribute to profits. Overall, we are focusing on retail, agriculture and MSME (RAM) segment in an aggressive way now, which helps with higher yield. Fresh slippages in Q4FY25 were the highest since Q4FY23. Which segments did bad loans emerge from? About \u20b91,400 croreof slippages came from agriculture sector. Of the \u20b91,400 crore of agri slippages, \u20b91,100 crore slippages came from loans up to \u20b910 lakh. We have strengthened the system now and already \u20b9288 crore of recovery has happened in April from these slippages. This quarter I would like to call an outlier. From here on, every quarter we are going to restrict fresh slippages to \u20b91,700 crore-\u20b91,800 crore. Apart from agriculture slippages, we saw around \u20b91,000 crore of slippages from MSMEs and retail slippages were at \u20b9490 crore. The judgment has recently been declared. In total, there are 32 lenders, and there is a committee of creditors (CoC). All these lenders are going to deliberate over the matter soon and then we will decide the future course of action. There are multiple options before the lenders. As per the law of the land, whatever is required to be done for this particular account, bank will do it as per CoC mandate. Unless and until the final recourse is available, I think there is no need for banks to go for any other activity. Our exposure to this account was around 0.5 per cent of our total loan book, we recovered \u20b93,000 crore from the account post JSW Steel acquisition. We have migrated to a new commenting platform.

            "text": "The US government's order to pharma firms to lower the cost of prescription medicines within 30 days will not impact Indian generic drugmakers, Cipla MD and Global CEO Umang Vohra said on Tuesday. He noted that the Executive Order signed by US President Donald Trump on Monday is probably going to impact branded drugs. \"What we understand is that this is largely targeted towards branded drugs ... As of now, what we understand is that this is a voluntary measure that perhaps the companies will be taking,\" Vohra stated. \"So, as of now, from a generic perspective, I think generic (drug) prices in the US are already significantly comparable with the rest of the world, in some cases it is lower. So we don't believe that at least for now, based on what the promulgation says, we think this is more (towards) branded sector ... rather anything on the generic side,\" Vohra said. The order calls on the health department to broker new price tags for drugs. If a deal is not reached, a new rule will kick in that will tie the price of what the US pays for medications to lower prices paid by other countries. Replying to a query regarding the impact on the company's business if the US government imposes tax on pharmaceutical imports, Vohra said: \"Our business continues as usual. There's never been any stoppage at any place in the US on account of any confusion with respect to tariffs. \"And so we don't see the impact. In any case, we are in the generics sector. The purpose of what we do is to provide medicines to people who really need it from an affordability perspective. So, as of now, we don't see any impact of tariffs on our business,\" he added. \"We are monitoring all of that. And you know, we don't expect material changes to the business environment for generics,\" he said. India currently levies about 10 per cent import duty on American drugs, while no charges are levied on Indian drugs being imported by the US. In April, the US government exempted the Indian pharma sector from reciprocal tariffs, recognising the vital role played by the domestic industry in supplying affordable medicines across the globe."

In FY25, Dr Reddy\u2019s earned a revenue of \u20b953.7 billion registering a yoy growth of 16 per cent. \u201cThe growth was driven by revenues from the vaccine-portfolio in-licensed from Sanofi India, successful new product launches and price increase,\u2019\u2018 Ramana said. The total number of products launched in FY25 was 23. As per IQVIA, Dr Reddy\u2019s rank in the Indian pharma market is 10. To be among the top five players in the Indian market, Dr Reddy\u2019s is adopting a multi-pronged strategy of bringing more innovative products along with catering to the needs of consumer health and digital health products, Ramana said. Dr Reddy\u2019s has a collaboration with global major Nestle Health Sciences and has already launched some products and plans to bring more popular brands of Nestle to India in the coming days. The company is also focussing on the emerging market segment of digital therapeutics. Last year it launched a device for neuro modulation which helps patients with migraine and more digital therapeutic devices are in the pipeline. \u201cIndia is a very important market for us and we continue to step up our focus on the domestic market,\u2019\u2018 Ramana said.

            "text": "Indian automaker Tata Motors reported a 51.34 per cent decline in its consolidated net profit at \u20b98,470 crore in Q4 as compared to the year-ago quarter, which had a significant deferred tax benefit. During the quarter under review the company\u2019s bottomline was hit by exceptional items of Rs. 566 crore comprising provision for employee pension scheme, employee separation cost, past service cost, acquisition/demerger expenses, impairment of property, plant and equipment and provision for intangible assets under development. Volumes of both passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles were down on year, and that had an effect on the revenue from operations which was flat at Rs. 1,19,503 crore in Q4, while EBITDA margin fell 60 bps to 14 per cent. On a consolidated basis the company turned net auto cash positive in FY25 with a net cash balance of Rs 1,000 crore. In the near term, the company stated that the operating environment is uncertain and challenging due to tariffs and geopolitical actions. \u201cJLR, there are many moving points and clarifications required at the moment. We will be able to understand better with the FTAs coming into place and make comments on June 16, The investment will be funded out of cash flows in JLR. In the commercial vehicle segment, we expect to see growth as we already have a double-digit EBITDA margin. In the passenger vehicle segment, we expect profit, substantial electric vehicle penetration and market share gain. A slew of passenger vehicle launches are planned this year,\u201d said PB Balaji, Group Chief Financial Officer of Tata Motors, on a media call. The company\u2019s free cash flow (automotive) for the year stood at Rs. 22,400 crore (as compared to Rs. 26,900 crore in FY24). Tata Motors posted a 6.12 per cent increase in revenue from operations at Rs. 1,12,608 crore reported in Q3. The Board of Directors have recommended a final dividend of \u20b96/- per share, subject to approval by the shareholders. Passenger vehicle volumes during the quarter were down 5.5 per cent year-on-year at 1,47,000 units, while the EBIT margin was down 1.6 per cent year-on-year owing to cost reduction actions and incentives more than offsetting adverse realisation. On a full-year basis, the passenger vehicle business revenue declined by 7.5 per cent. The company stated that the decline in revenue was primarily on account of a decline in hatchback volumes. \u201cThe electric vehicle fleet size has come down to 65,000 units this year. There is a 13 per cent decline. We are working on it and making effective interventions with a set of actions. Mainstreaming electric vehicles is very important, and we will be doing that this year with the product portfolio, including the Sierra and Harrier,\u201d said PB Balaji. Tata Motors\u2019 electric vehicle market share stood at 55.4 per cent, while the penetration was at 11 per cent and CNG penetration was at 25 per cent in FY25. The company stated that in FY25, Rs. 385 crore was recognised as benefits from the PLI as compared to Rs. 142 crore in FY24. \u201cIn a year marked by fluctuating demand, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles led the industry in SUV growth and outpaced the market in CNG sales. Our multi-powertrain strategy and a strong commitment to sustainable mobility enabled us to increase the share of CNG and electric vehicles to 36 per cent of our overall portfolio,\u201d said Shailesh Chandra, Managing Director of TMPV and TPEM. The commercial vehicle business saw a marginal drop in domestic wholesales with 99,600 units in Q4, a 4.8 per cent decrease year-on-year. Exports during the quarter increased 29.4 per cent year-on-year to 5,900 units."

            "text": "The company decided against issuing an operating profit forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026 | Photo Credit: KIM KYUNG-HOON Nissan Motor Co. vowed to close seven factories and cut 20,000 jobs after posting its biggest annual loss since French carmaker Renault SA rescued the company from near bankruptcy a quarter century ago. The company decided against issuing an operating profit forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026. The carmaker reported a net loss of \u00a5670.9 billion ($4.5 billion) in the year that ended in March. Nissan is also accelerating its restructuring. The carmaker will close the seven manufacturing facilities by the 2027 fiscal year, with annual production capacity set to fall to 2.5 million units from 3.5 million last year. It also confirmed it will cut 20,000 jobs, which includes the loss of 9,000 roles it announced previously. The measures are aimed at cutting costs by \u00a5500 billion, it said. The ailing Japanese carmaker has struggled to turnaround its business as its aging lineup failed to win over consumers in the US and China. It\u2019s already announced plans to cut thousands of jobs, slash production capacity and replaced most of its top executives \u2014 including appointing a new chief executive officer \u2014 after efforts to combine with Honda Motor Co. fell apart earlier this year, leaving it in urgent need of another lifeline. \u201cReality is clear,\u201d CEO Ivan Espinosa said in his first post-earnings briefing since taking the top job in April. \u201cNissan must prioritize self-improvement with greater urgency and speed.\u201d The sweeping changes signal a major departure from previous CEO Makoto Uchida, who was criticized for not being aggressive enough with his plan to cut 9,000 jobs and reduce production by 20 per cent. Nissan had indicated broader plans to cut output, announcing last week that it was abandoning plans to build a battery plant in Fukuoka in order to focus on its own recovery. Even with deepening cuts, Nissan faces an uphill battle in finding a savior with the collapse of tie-up talks with Honda complicating its search. Meanwhile, Nissan\u2019s restructuring efforts risk being derailed by US tariffs on imported cars and auto parts. The carmaker said it expects to see a \u00a5450 billion impact from policies, which is included in its forecast for a \u00a5200 billion operating loss in the first quarter. Exports from Mexico and Japan account for almost 45% of Nissan\u2019s sales in the US, Chief Financial Officer Jeremie Papin said. Duties will affect 300,000 units in exports from Mexico, and 120,000 units from Japan, he said. Trump\u2019s ever-changing trade policies are already rippling through the global auto sector with some manufacturers like Stellantis NV and Mercedes-Benz Group AG pulling their earnings forecasts and others warning of substantial hits to the bottom line. General Motors Co. slashed its profit outlook due to as much as $5 billion of exposure to auto tariffs, while Ford Motor Co. expects a $1.5 billion hit to results. Japan\u2019s top carmakers have joined the chorus sounding the alarm over the implications of Trump\u2019s ever-changing trade policies. Toyota Motor Corp. said it estimates a \u00a5180 billion hit to operating income over just two months and Mazda Motor Co. withheld annual guidance while warning of a \u00a510 billion impact just for the month of April. Separately, Renault, which has a roughly 36% stake in Nissan, said it expects to see a \u20ac2.2 billion ($2.4 billion) hit to its first-quarter net income due to the Japanese carmaker\u2019s turnaround efforts. Espinosa said Nissan is looking to enhance its partnership with Renault in Europe, India and Latin America, and work with Mitsubishi in the US on the development of pickup trucks and electric-vehicle batteries. It may also look to work with Honda for the US, he said."

The country\u2019s largest gas utility is expected to report its Q4 FY25 and FY25 performance on Tuesday. Emkay Global Financial Services expects softness in petrochemicals and higher transmission opex for GAIL to be partly offset by higher gas marketing margins. GAIL\u2019s gas volumes could be largely flat quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q), while petrochemicals earnings may decline sequentially on higher gas cost despite steady plant utilisation levels at around 105 per cent. LPG earnings are likely to decline q-o-q due to reduced APM allocation. Similarly, JM Financial expects GAIL\u2019s operating profits to appreciate sequentially on a low base on likely normalisation of the gas trading segment. GAIL\u2019s operating profits in its gas transmission business are expected to decline sequentially on higher transmission cost, while volume is expected to be higher q-o-q. Its petrochemicals earnings are also expected to decline sequential due to lower sales volume and margins. LPG earnings are also likely to decline q-o-q due to fall in global LPG prices and lower production after 1/3rd cut in APM allocation for LPG segment impacted its viability. During Q3FY25, GAIL reported a 52 per cent y-o-y growth in its consolidated net profit at around \u20b94,084 crore, aided by a \u20b92,440 crore compensation for LNG supplies. In Q3FY25, GAIL\u2019s average natural gas transmission volume rose by 3.6 per cent y-o-y to 125.93 million standard cubic meters per day (MSCMD).

Analysts expect its Q4 revenue to pickup marginally due to subdued demand in the domestic market. While the net profit is projected to surge 7.7 per cent y-o-y to \u20b91,095 crore (as compared with \u20b91,016 crore in the same quarter last fiscal), revenue is expected to rise by around two per cent y-o-y to \u20b99,715 crore.

The company had reported a decline of 44 per cent in its April domestic wholesales (dispatches to dealers) to 2,88,524 units (5,13,296 units in April 2024). The decline is attributed to a temporary production halt from April 17\u201319 at its Dharuhera, Gurugram, Haridwar and Neemrana facilities, to facilitate supply chain alignment and conduct scheduled maintenance and infrastructure enhancements.

Net profit of Rs 2,049.03 crore in January-March - the fourth quarter of April 2024 to March 2025 fiscal year - compared with Rs 2,176.97 crore earning a year back and Rs 3,867.38 crore profit in the preceding October-December 2024 quarter, according to the company\u2019s stock exchange filing. GAIL chairman and managing director Sandeep Kumar Gupta said profitability is lower than the preceding quarter as the company had a one-time gain from an arbitration award in Q3.

Iron ore is little changed in May after a run of three monthly losses that came as the global trade war escalated and Chinese authorities were set to order mills to reduce steel output. Last week, the China Iron and Steel Association said that the government was \u201cactively deploying and promoting\u201d the steel-production mandate. \u201cAs we enter May, downstream demand will be impacted to some extent by the off-season,\u201d Shanghai Metals Market said in a note. In addition, the focus will be on the policy to reduce steel production, and the accumulation of major steel inventories, it added. Iron ore traded 0.5 per cent lower at $99.55 a ton at 10:55 a.m. in Singapore, while yuan-priced futures in Dalian were flat.

Its founder, Anil Jain, had previously told businessline that his philosophy is to identify business opportunities and pursue them either through organic expansion or acquisition \u2014 and then leave it to professionals to run the businesses. The group\u2019s entry into wind turbine manufacturing was driven by Madhusudan Khemka, a wind industry veteran who set up and ran the wind turbine company ReGen Powertech until it was overwhelmed in 2017 by a sudden change in the way wind tariffs were determined \u2014 from fixed tariffs to competitively discovered tariffs. ReGen had access to Vensys technology under a licence; Khemka knew Vensys well. He brought Vensys and the Refex Group together. The result was Venwind Refex Power Ltd. Khemka, who advises Venwind, says the 5.3 MW turbine is based on a \u2018hybrid technology\u2019 \u2014 a combination of geared and gearless turbine designs \u2014 and is well suited for low-wind Indian sites. He said that the cut-in speed \u2014 the wind speed at which the turbine begins to operate \u2014 is as low as 2 metres per second for these machines. This makes it suitable for states like Odisha and Jharkhand, which have available land but low wind speeds.

            "text": "Consumer durables makers are, however, hoping for a pick-up in sales from mid-May until July, with extended summer, particularly in North India. | Photo Credit: MOORTHY M After a promosing start to the summer this year, unseasonal rains in some parts of the country and lower-than-expected tempratures have hit sales of air conditioners in April and first week of May, though AC makers hope for an extended summer to make up for the subdued so far. While sales have been impacted across the country, a decline of up to 30 per cent has been witnessed in South India, retailers said. Leading makers of room ACs said that their sales volumes in April have grown in mid-single digits compared to their expectations of 20-30 per cent growth. Consumer durables makers are, however, hoping for a pick-up in sales from mid-May until July, with extended summer, particularly in North India. \u201cJanuary, February were good, but as the season moved into summer, there have been rains and thunderstorms in some parts of the country, which have brought down consumer sentiment. The initial sentiments were good, but the summer has begun late. I believe it will be an extended one. Hopefully, we will be able to make up for what we have now been able to encash initially. We are buoyant that the summer will be extended. We intend to grow, but it will depend on this summer season,\u201d said Pradeep Bakshi, Managing Director & CEO of Voltas Ltd, during a company earnings call. Analysts have pointed out that with a decrease in demand for air conditioners, consumer durable makers are sitting on high inventories, which they had stockpiled in anticipation of a hot summer that would send demand spiking. \u201cUnseasonal rains in April/May have impacted AC demand, which would be reflected in weak primary sales in 1Q26 as inventory remains elevated. Rising competition and aggressive pricing/higher discounts to recover market share are likely to lead to margin risks for Voltas despite production-linked incentives (PLI). Increased backwards integration should keep costs elevated,\u201d said a Nomura commentary on Voltas. \u201cThe company is hopeful that with the IMD forecast of a tough summer from May 12, there will be a pick-up. We are a seasoned player, and it will be a disappointment if the rains continue throughout the summer. Last year, we were not happy in the room air conditioner segment in Q1, and we did not get market share, but it picked up, and we did better in Q3 and Q4. Our goal is to have 15 per cent market share quickly,\u201d said B Thiagarajan, Managing Director of Blue Star Ltd, during an earnings call. The company, in its near-term outlook, stated that April witnessed milder weather and softer growth. Going by the weather forecast, the company expects the demand to pick up in May and June. \u201cThe RAC industry started CY25 with a 10 per cent revenue growth expectation for summer, on a high base. This went to over 20 per cent in Feb-Mar-25, owing to the early onset of summer in some regions, heat alert by IMD and dealers stocking in anticipation of strong demand. However, given the weak secondary sales in Mar-Apr-25, industry revenue growth expectations have again tapered to 10 per cent, with hopes pinned on a demand pick up in North and extended summer,\u201d stated BNP Paribas Consumer electronics retail chains pointed out that the category was also impacted by fewer heat waves in southern India this year. Companies are expecting the air conditioner category to grow in low-single digit up to 3 per cent this summer. \u201cThe temperatures did not go up in the South region as expected because of unseasonal rains. The west region also saw continuous rains for two weeks, which has resulted in the air conditioners segment being hit. The dip in the southern region is 30 per cent, and on a country level, the decrease would be between 10 and 15 per cent. Even in the north, the temperatures did not go up as expected. The overall growth of air conditioners depends on the last two weeks of May and early June, and if there is a delayed summer, then only the category will revive. The revival is also we are anticipated in north India,\u201d Nilesh Gupta, Director, Vijay Sales, told businessline."

            "text": "A Joint Working Group (JWG) formed by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG) has suggested subsiding private operators who supply natural gas to the north eastern States. The panel, which comprises officials from the exploration & production (E&P) sector, national oil companies (NoCs) and government in a bid to enhance oil and gas production and to attract investments, was formed last year. On enhancing natural gas supply in the north East, the JWG suggested that a subsidy of 40 per cent on supply of natural gas may be extended to every operator in the North-East region. The JWG explained that the existing gas price mechanism in the north-east region is characterised by the coexistence of multiple gas prices, which poses significant challenges for private operators. According to the new domestic natural gas pricing guidelines, a subsidy of 40 per cent on administered price mechanism (APM) allocated to natural gas is provided to the NoCs in the region. However, the guidelines lack clarity in applicability of the subsidy for natural gas supplied by private operators in the north-east region. This arrangement allows ONGC and OIL to benefit from discounted gas prices and undermines the competitiveness of private companies, the JWG explained."

            "text": "Ajoy Chawla, a hands-on leader and Tata Group veteran with nearly three decades of experience, will take over as Managing Director and CEO of Titan Company, starting January 2026. From packing jewellery and watch orders in a small warehouse in London during Titan\u2019s early days in Europe, to soon helming the company, Chawla\u2019s journey reflects a deep-rooted journey within the Tata ecosystem. Chawla\u2019s journey with the Tata Group began after completing his post-graduate diploma in management from IIM Calcutta, when he was inducted into the Tata Administrative Service (TAS). He joined Titan in 1990 and has since risen steadily through the ranks, currently serving as the head of the Jewellery Division since 2019. A mechanical engineer by training, Chawla spent the initial years of his career in Titan\u2019s Watches Division, where he held various roles across commercial functions, sales, retailing, supply chain and SAP implementation. He also led the Accessories and Licensed Brands strategic business unit (SBU), gaining deep cross-functional exposure. In the book Titan: Inside India\u2019s Most Successful Consumer Brand, Chawla recalled his early days in Titan\u2019s European operations, which floundered, when he sometimes himself packed jewellery and watches for sale. \u201cI\u2019d quickly freshen up, suit up and soon be discussing business plans for our European operations,\u201d he recounted, highlighting both the agility and entrepreneurial spirit that marked his early leadership style. Later, in the 2000s, Chawla headed strategy and business incubation for Titan and was closely involved with former MD Bhaskar Bhat in Titan\u2019s exercise, Future Shock, which had around 60 middle and senior managers of the company brainstorming ideas for the future. Many ideas were thrown up, and one of them was eyewear, which he piloted. It took a lot of convincing on Chawla\u2019s part to make his colleagues understand that wearing stylish spectacles was a style statement and prescription wear was not a health issue. From 2013 to 2019, Chawla served as Titan\u2019s Chief Strategy Officer while continuing to lead business incubation. During this period, he scaled up the fragrances business and laid the foundation for Taneira and Titan\u2019s entry into the saree segment. Later, he moved on to lead Tanishq \u2014 Titan\u2019s flagship jewellery business, which he continues to head. As he prepares to take on the reins in 2026, Titan will be led by someone who has not only witnessed but also shaped its evolution over the past three decades.

            "text": "A former IAS officer of the Gujarat cadre, Gupta took charge of SECI CMD in June 2023 and his tenure was to end in June 2025. He held the post of Environment Secretary before his retirement. His services were abruptly terminated last week. SECI, which is under the administrative control of the MNRE, is one of the four Renewable Energy Implementing Agencies (REIAs), which are tasked with floating tenders for renewable energy sources (RES). However, government sources said that issues of pending power purchase agreements (PPAs), SECI\u2019s legal battles with Reliance Power and JSW Energy\u2019s and the controversy over allegation of industrialist Gautam Adani bribing state government power officials could be the reason behind his termination. \u201cThe public sector SECI was indicted on November 20, 2024, by US authorities in the chargesheet against Gautam Adani and his close associates. It was based on SECI\u2019s recommendation that different states entered into purchase agreements with Adani. Bribes worth \u20b92,029 crores were then reportedly offered and promised to Indian Government officials in exchange for these agreements, which were then finalised,\u201d Ramesh said in a tweet on X. In an implicit admission of corruption, in December 2024, SECI changed the way its issues power tenders. Now the CMD of SECI, occupied by a post-retirement bureaucrat appointed by the Modi Govt., has been sacked just a month before his tenure ends, he added. \u201cMeanwhile the Indian government has yet to respond to repeated requests by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to serve a summons to Adani and the other accused. Despite the attempts at the highest levels, the Modani MegaScam cannot be covered up,\u201d the senior Congress leader said. Another issue that impacted SECI\u2019s image is the PSU barring Reliance Power and its subsidiary Reliance NU BESS from participating in tenders floated by the state-run entity for 3 years in November 2024. Reliance moved the Delhi High Court, which stayed SECI\u2019s order. The PSU had to withdraw the debarment notice against Reliance and its subsidiary."

And, in a way it is also an endorsement of our business,\u201d More Retail Managing Director, Vinod Nambiar said on Monday. Amazon and Samara Capital hold 48 per cent and 51 per cent stakes, respectively, in the Mumbai-based food and grocery retail chain. Talking to reporters in Kolkata, Nambiar said that the IPO proceeds would be used to propel the company\u2019s business growth and reduce debt going forward. The company plans to expand its store count to around 3,000 by 2030 from the current 775. The supermarket retailer aims at expanding the store count to around 1,000 by this fiscal-end. It is planning to enter Odisha and Jharkhand soon by opening new stores. \u201cThe company currently has a debt of around \u20b9500 crore. We want to reduce the debt between now and the public offering by about a half. We want to be a company with minimal debt after IPO,\u201d Nambiar said. More Retail, one of the largest retail chains in India, posted a revenue of around \u20b95,000 crore last fiscal. It is planning to clock \u20b96,000 crore revenue by FY26, and \u20b97,500-8,000 crore revenue by FY27. \u201cWe will turn PAT positive I think in about two years from now,\u201d the MD said, adding the company is expected to post an EBITDA of \u20b960 crore in this fiscal.

The distributors in Maharashtra had earlier announced the suspension of product purchases in Maharashtra starting May 12, in protest over its steep discounts on quick commerce platforms. The agitation was called off after a meeting between AICPDF members and Colgate-Palmolive officials. During the meeting, the distributors presented data reflecting a 30 to 50 per cent drop in revenue attributed to margin compression, market disruption and shifting of the company\u2019s policies. \u201c It was discussed that the market operating rate disturbances have increased in the recent past, both from the alternative channels and the stockists, and hence, we need to find a way within legal guardrails to have a check on the same. In cases of violation of recommended retail selling prices by alternate channels, the company agreed to review and engage with concerned stakeholders as per their internal protocols and guardrails allowed under the law,\u201d said a statement from AICPDF. The organisation stated that the toothpaste maker has agreed to review the situation and will follow up on the commitments made in the meeting, \u201cThe company has agreed to review these issues with the help of commercial teams as per their internal protocols within the guardrails allowed under the law, and thereafter implement appropriate commercial actions. We agreed that we will assess the impact of the same over the next 30-60-90 days to see progress,\u201d mentions the statement. With the conflict of India-Pakistan, the distributor body stated that it does not want to impact the supply of products across the country. \u201cIn the light of the situation and growing concerns over national security, AICPDF has decided to defer the planned agitation against Colgate-Palmolive to avoid any disruptions in the supply of essential products. Our responsibility to the country comes first. We have received assurances from Colgate and will monitor implementation closely. However, if corrective measures are not executed within the committed timeline, AICPDF will reinitiate necessary actions post-quarter,\u201d said Dhairyashil Patil, National President, AICPDF.

The iOS-based smartphones bumped Xiaomi off the top 10 list as the Chinese brand\u2019s market share fell 48 per cent on an annual basis from 12.8 per cent last year to 7.8 per cent this year. Apple in India shipped 3.2 million smartphones in Q1FY25, with iPhone 16 accounting for 4 per cent of overall India shipments, the highest shipped model during the quarter. Iphone 16 was also among the highest shipped 5G model, aside from Xiaomi Redmi 14C, OPPO K12x/A3x and realme 14x. Vivo, Samsung and Oppo held on to their titles as the top 3 smartphone brands of India. However, the overall market still declined 5.5 per cent year-over-year, the second consecutive quarterly decline in shipments. Weak consumer demand and surplus inventory from the previous quarter continue to pose challenges, said IDC. \u201cThe first two months of the year saw fewer launches with brands focusing on offering retail support, discounts and price drops on older models to clear inventory. However, new launches picked up in March across price segments with enhanced marketing activities to drive demand,\u201d said Aditya Rampal, Senior Market Analyst, Devices Research, IDC Asia Pacific. Among smartphones, the average selling price grew by 4 per cent annually, reaching a record of $274. The premium segment registered the highest growth of 78.6 per cent, with share up from 2 per cent to 4 per cent. iPhone 16 alone accounted for 32 per cent of the shipments in this segment. The mid-premium segment also saw strong growth of 74 per cent. Apple and Samsung\u2019s share increased in this segment, led by iPhone 13 and Galaxy A56. Qualcomm-based shipments grew by 40.8 per cent annually, at 31.8 per cent share, while MediaTek\u2019s share declined to 43.6 per cent from 55.3 per cent. In Q1FY25, 29 million 5G smartphones were shipped in the quarter. The share of online channels dropped to 41.9 per cent, the lowest since 3Q19, due to \u201congoing omnichannel strategy\u201d by almost all brands, spreading footprints into smaller towns/cities, offering attractive channel margins and support, which should remain in the upcoming quarters as well. Samsung led the online channel followed by Motorola and realme. Further, Vivo led the offline channel, followed by OPPO and Samsung. \u201cTo mitigate potential cost increases arising from geopolitical uncertainties, vendors globally will be eyeing India as a preferred manufacturing destination. This will require efforts to scale up local manufacturing, especially by India-based contract manufacturers, ensuring India to evolve as a global manufacturing hub,\u201d says Upasana Joshi, Senior Research Manager, Devices Research, IDC Asia Pacific."

            "text": "The markets witnessed an unprecedented rally on Monday, with benchmark indices recording their biggest single-day gains in nearly four years, driven by a cessation of hostilities between Indian and Pakistan and US-China agreeing to a temporary rollback of trade tariffs for a 90-day period. The Sensex surged 2,975.43 points (3.74 per cent) to close at 82,429.90, while the Nifty 50 jumped 916.70 points (3.82 per cent) to end at 24,924.70, logging the biggest single day gain since February 1, 2021. \u201cThe ceasefire announcement has eased geopolitical concerns, allowing markets to reorient toward stability and policy continuity,\u201d said Arun Patel, Founder and Partner at Arunasset Investment Services. Top gainers led the charge, with Adani Enterprises rising 7.73 per cent, Infosys climbing 7.69 per cent, Shriram Finance up 7.16 per cent, Trent gaining 6.79 per cent, and Wipro increasing by 5.99 per cent. The rally was broad-based, with nearly 90 per cent of Nifty 500 stocks trading in positive territory. Sectoral indices showed remarkable strength, with the Nifty Realty index jumping 5.93 per cent and the IT index surging 6.48 per cent. Vaibhav Vidwani, Research Analyst at Bonanza, noted, \u201cThe sharp rally was primarily driven by the announcement of a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan over the weekend, which significantly eased geopolitical tensions.\u201d The market sentiment was further bolstered by additional positive developments, including an early forecast for the South-West monsoon and upcoming Russia-Ukraine peace talks. The market\u2019s technical outlook remains robust. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, observed, \u201cThe Nifty witnessed its best day in four years... Technically, the index has broken out of recent consolidation across multiple timeframes, confirming a positive trend.\u201d Analysts suggest the index could potentially target 25,200-25,300 levels in the short term. Commodities markets also saw significant movement, with gold experiencing a sharp decline. Jateen Trivedi from LKP Securities reported gold prices plunging approximately \u20b94,000 to \u20b992,500 on the MCX, driven by easing global tensions and a strengthening dollar index. The broader market showed exceptional strength, with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 indices surging over 4 per cent each. Trading volumes on the NSE cash market increased by 13 per cent, while the India VIX volatility index dropped 15 per cent, indicating reduced market uncertainty. As the market closed, investors and analysts alike are watching closely to see if the current momentum can be sustained in the coming trading sessions, with particular attention to the potential impact of the India-Pakistan ceasefire and ongoing global trade negotiations."

REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas/File Photo | Photo Credit: FRANCIS MASCARENHAS PVR INOX Ltd, one of India\u2019s largest cinema chains, announced a net loss of \u20b9105.8 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, according to financial results released today. The company reported revenue of \u20b91,285.3 crore and EBITDA of \u20b925 crore for Q4 FY25. The shares of PVR INOX Ltd were trading at \u20b9957.95 up by \u20b936.50 or 3.96 per cent on the NSE today at 2.30 pm. The multiplex operator attributed the underwhelming performance to an \u201cuneven release calendar\u201d and inconsistent content availability. Both Bollywood and Hollywood underperformed, contributing to a 9 per cent decline in overall gross box office revenue. Hindi box office collections dropped 26 per cent due to fewer film releases and postponements, while Hollywood revenues fell 28 per cent. Despite these challenges, PVR INOX welcomed 30.5 million patrons during the quarter, with an average ticket price of \u20b9258 and food and beverage spending per head of \u20b9125. For the full fiscal year 2025, the company recorded a net loss of \u20b9151.9 crore on revenue of \u20b95,874.6 crore.

The Nifty India Tourism index closed at 9,021.10, up 5.55 per cent from the previous session, while the Nifty India Defence index gained 0.70 per cent to close at 7,138.35. Tourism stocks showed robust performance, with IndiGo emerging as a top performer in the sector, jumping 7.82 per cent to close at \u20b95,500. Chalet Hotels followed closely, rising 8.34 per cent to \u20b9865, reflecting investor optimism about the reopening of 32 previously closed airports across northern and western India. Other notable gainers in the tourism sector included Indian Hotels Company (INDHOTEL) with a 7.12 per cent increase, BLS International Services up 6.79 per cent, and Lemon Tree Hotels rising 6.47 per cent. GMR Airports Infrastructure and IRCTC also posted strong gains of 4.62 per cent and 5.83 per cent respectively.

Notably, Data Patterns India continued its impressive run, adding 4.07 per cent to close at \u20b92,388.50. The market rally was underpinned by the weekend agreement between India and Pakistan to cease military operations across land, air, and sea. A scheduled meeting between the Director Generals of Military Operations (DGMO) from both countries further supported the positive sentiment. Trading volumes were substantial, with the tourism index recording transactions worth \u20b92,658.71 crores and the defence index seeing \u20b97,239.72 crores in trades. The broader market also reflected this optimism, with the Sensex surging 3.74 per cent to close at 82,429.90 and the Nifty 50 jumping 3.82 per cent to end at 24,924.70. The potential reopening of airports that were closed following the recent military standoff, including strategic locations like Srinagar and Amritsar, has generated significant interest among investors. This development comes in the wake of the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack and the subsequent military tensions that had previously dampened market sentiment. Sector experts suggest that the de-escalation and potential normalization of trade relations could provide a much-needed boost to tourism and defence-related businesses that had been under pressure due to recent geopolitical uncertainties."

Gavai clarified that it would not consider any petition challenging the validity of Waqf Act, 1995, by Hindu parties The Supreme Court questioned the Centre about the decision having non-Muslims as majority members in Waqf Council | PTI The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear on May 20 a batch of petitions challenging the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025, and will consider whether interim order is required on three issues - Waqf by user, nomination of non-Muslims to Waqf Council and Boards, and identification of government land under Waqf. A bench headed by Chief Justice of India B.R. Gavai clarified that it would not consider any petition challenging the validity of Waqf Act, 1995, by Hindu parties while considering the need for passing any interim order on May 20. The court took note of the statement given by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta\u2014that the Central government would not enforce the provisions of the Act\u2014would remain in effect. The top court while adjourning the matter said that it will only give two hours to argue the case to each side. The order was issued during the hearing of multiple petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025. The amendment was passed by the Lok Sabha on April 3 and cleared by the Rajya Sabha a day later. It received Presidential assent on April 5. The Act modifies the Waqf Act, 1995, which governs properties dedicated for religious or charitable purposes under Islamic law. A batch of petitions have been filed before the Supreme Court contesting the legality of the amendments. These include challenges from Congress MP Mohammad Jawed and AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi and many other individuals. Petitioners argue that the amendments unfairly single out the Muslim community, undermining their constitutionally guaranteed right to manage religious affairs under Article 26 of the Constitution. However, defending the amendment, the Union government told the Court that the changes were intended to curb the misuse of Waqf provisions, which had been exploited to illegitimately claim private and public lands. According to the government\u2019s written submission, since the 2013 amendment to the Waqf Act, there had been a 116 per cent increase in reported auqaf (Waqf) land area, raising concerns of widespread misuse. \"It is submitted that despite the existence of the concept of 'Waqf by user', the requirement of registration or self-declarations before the Court were made mandatory in order to ensure that the regulatory provisions of the enactments achieve the intended objectives. It is submitted that therefore, there has been a clear and mandatory legislative regime, which has sought to enforce and implement registration requirements on all kinds of Waqfs since at least 1923,\" the affidavit reads adding that Centre said that it is too late in the day for anyone to claim today that although it claims to be a genuine Waqf, it is still not registered. On the issue of trusts created by Muslim persons will not be governed by Waqf Act, the affidavit stated, \u201cThe Amendment Act reaffirms that identification, classification, and regulation of Waqf property must be subject to legal standards and judicial oversight. It is submitted that the legislative design of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025 ensures that no person is denied access to courts, and that the decisions affecting property rights, religious freedom, and public charity are made within the bounds of fairness and legality. It is submitted that through these changes, the Amendment Act brings judicial accountability, transparency, and fairness.\u201d"

Indore police registered a case against the Bharatiya Janata Party minister after he made objectionable remarks against Colonel Sofia Qureshi during a public event in Mhow recently. Hearing the matter on Wednesday, the High Court rapped the minister for his language and directed police to initiate immediate action against him. The High Court warned that contempt proceedings would be initiated against the state police chief if the case was not registered by Thursday evening.

Hearing the matter on Wednesday, a bench comprising Justices Atul Sreedharan and Justice Anuradha Shukla said the minister used 'language of the gutters' - not merely targeting the officer in question, but denigrating the armed forces as a whole, Live Law reported. The bench observed, \"The armed forces, perhaps the last institution existing in this country, reflecting integrity, industry, discipline, sacrifice, selflessness, character, honour and indomitable courage with which any citizen of this country who values the same can identify themselves with, has been targeted by Mr. Vijay Shah who has used the language of the gutters against Col. Sofia Quraishi,\" the publication reported. The bench noted that Col. Sofia Quraishi, along with Wing Commander Vyomika Singh, were the face of the armed forces briefing the media and the nation on the progress of 'Operation Sindoor'. \"The Minister made the unpardonable statements against Qureshi as an innuendo but which refers to none other but her alone,\" the bench said.

We couldn't undress them, so we sent a daughter from their community... You widowed sisters of our community, so a sister of your community will strip you naked. Modiji proved that the daughters of your caste can be sent to Pakistan to take revenge,\" NDTV reported. The minister published a video on social media on Wednesday and apologised for his comments. Shah said, \"I apologise for my recent statement, which hurt the sentiments of our society. The work done by Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, rising above religion and caste, is highly respected and appreciated. I respect her deeply. Although some inappropriate words came out in my recent statement, my intentions were always clear. I apologise to everyone, and especially to my sister, Sofiya Qureshi.\""

The top court had raised questions regarding the constitutionality of several provisions of the amended act. A bench comprising Chief Justice Gavai and Justice Augustine George Masih will resume hearing the matter on Thursday. A bunch of pleas were moved against the law by various Muslim bodies and opposition parties, including Congress, DMK, AIMIM and several others, demanding that the apex court strike down the law passed by the Parliament. The matter was being heard by a bench led by former Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna, and it was posted for further hearing on Thursday, considering he would demit office on May 13. While the nbench considered passing an interim order staying contentious provisions of the law, the Centre provided assurance regarding denotifying waqf properties, including \"waqf by user\", or making appointments in the central waqf council and boards till May 5. During the hearing, the top court questioned the denotification of waqf properties, including \"waqf by user\", and the appointment of non-Muslims in the central waqf councils and boards. The Centre filed a preliminary 1,332-page affidavit on April 25 defending the amended act and opposed any blanket stay on the law. The Union minority affairs ministry urged the top court to dismiss the pleas and said a \"mischievous false narrative\" was being made around certain provisions. The Centre claimed there has been a \"shocking increase\" of 116 per cent in the waqf properties since 2013. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has accused the Centre of submitting incorrect data in the top court and sought action against the officer concerned for filing a \"false affidavit\"."

Security forces have cordoned off the region (File) Security personnel rush to the spot after terrorists attacked a group of tourists at Pahalgam, Jammu & Kashmir | PTI An encounter broke out between security forces and terrorists in the Tral area of south Kashmir's Pulwama district during the early hours on Thursday. Security forces had cordoned off the Nader area of Tral after receiving specific information about the presence of terrorists. As they approached the suspected spot, the terrorists opened fire, which was retaliated, leading to a gunfight. \"Encounter has started at Nader, Tral area of #Awantipora. Police and security forces are on the job. Further details shall follow,\" the Jammu and Kashmir Police said in a post on X. This is the second encounter in the region this week. On May 13, three Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) terrorists were killed in an encounter at Keller, Shopian in south Kashmir. One of the slain militants was identified as Shahid Kuttay, son of Mohammad Yousuf Kuttay, from Chotipora Heerpora in Shopian. According to officials, Shahid joined the LeT on March 8, 2023 and was listed as an \u2018A\u2019 category terrorist. Shahid was allegedly involved in several attacks, including the firing at Danish Resort on April 8, 2025 that injured two German tourists and a local driver, the killing of a BJP Sarpanch in Heerpora on 18 May 2024, and is suspected in the murder of a Territorial Army personnel in Kulgam on 3 February 2025. Security forces have intensified operations against terrorists after the Pahalgam attack on April 22, in which 26 people, including 25 tourists and one local horse ride operator, were killed. India retaliated by targeting multiple sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on May 7 under 'Operation Sindoor'. The operation escalated tensions between India and Pakistan and after four days of hostilities, both countries agreed to stop firing.

The case relates to a heist and the murder of a security guard at former chief minister J. Jayalalithaa\u2019s Kodanad estate bungalow located in the picturesque Nilgiris. Answering questions from the scribes after inaugurating the houses for the mahouts at the Mudumalai elephant camp, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin reaffirmed his government\u2019s commitment to justice in the Kodanad heist case. \u201cI had assured the people of Tamil Nadu that the accused in the Pollachi sexual assault case would face the harshest punishment. That promise has been fulfilled. Similarly, the accused in the Kodanad case will be brought to justice soon,\u201d he said. While the Pollachi sexual assault case was handled by the CBI and the trial went on for six years, the Kodanad heist case is handled by the Crime Branch CID under Tamil Nadu\u2019s home department. The case has been pending in Ooty district court for the past four years, without any progress from the prosecution. The prosecution apparently has not submitted any incriminating documents to bring the accused to the books. The trial in the Ooty district court began after two of the accused in the case Sayan and Manoj sought the court to enquire former chief minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Jayalalithaa\u2019s aide V.K. Sasikala. However the CB-CID which is investigating the case doesn\u2019t seem to have made any breakthrough in the case. Also, the case has been handled by more than three investigating officers since the DMK government came to power. While Sasikala was questioned in the case, the attempts to interrogate Palaniswami did not materialise as he was the former chief minister. The first chargesheet in the case was filed in 2017 immediately after the heist cum murder during the then AIADMK regime against the accused in the case\u2014Walayar Manoj, Sayan, Santhosh, Deepu, Satheesan, Udhyakumar, Jithin Joy, Jamsheer Ali, Manoj Sami and Bijin Kutty. Later an interim chargesheet was filed after the DMK government took charge. Sri Lanka civic polls: Is NPP losing popularity among the people?

Calls for boycotting Turkish goods and tourism have surfaced across the country, with online travel platforms such as EaseMyTrip, MakeMyTrip and Ixigo issuing advisories against visiting these nations.

Raghu R Nair, NM during a special briefing on Operation Sindoor, in New Delhi | PTI 3. Op Sindoor exposed Pakistan as a country that continues to sponsor and support terrorism. The selection of nine targets was done meticulously, displaying synergy between military and intelligence agencies in identifying targets and its details for successful execution of aerial targeting. The precise execution of the attack over the terror epicentres dealt a significant blow to the terror industry that Pakistan had been cultivating for decades. The killing of five most wanted terrorists and many others associated with running the terror factory is a huge setback that ISI, the most active sponsor of terrorist groups, is struggling to digest. The terrorist\u2019s safe havens were located in markaz, sarjal, masjid, maskar and camps in various locations inside Pakistan opposite to Line of Control (LOC) and International Border (IB). For the first time, targets in Pakistan\u2019s Punjab were struck. These places were used to organise, plan, raise funds, communicate, train, recruit, transit and operate in relative security due to the backing of Pakistan\u2019s premier institution, the Pakistan Army. 5. India conducted retaliatory strikes in a classical manner. The world had previously witnessed high-tech operations during the Gulf wars in 1991. Prior to the ground assault by the surface forces, Iraq\u2019s fighting capability was decimated through aerial bombardments. Thereafter operational success of the Army of coalition forces was quick with minimum causalities. Similarly, India used its drones, loitering munitions, missiles, air to surface bombs/missiles to degrade or destroy Pakistan\u2019s air defence capability. The limited SEAD/DEAD operations carried out by India in certain sectors were effective in creating corridors for conducting air operations. The attacks on eight airfields and their aircraft operating surfaces were highly successful and would have supported further air operations with minimal attrition. More such operations would be required to achieve a certain degree of control of air in the form of air superiority or supremacy to assist Army in conducting ground operations with minimal interference from the Pakistan Air Force. 8. The planning and conduct of Operation Sindoor and subsequent retaliatory strikes by India have several important key takeaways: d. Initial measures adopted by Indian leadership after the Pahalgam attack, prior to Operation Sindoor, effectively targeted Pakistan\u2019s core instruments of national power. Had India continued these measures, Pakistan would have been strangulated economically, diplomatically and militarily. e. The Operations exposed Pakistan\u2019s leadership as propaganda masters and the Pakistan Army as weak domestically and internationally. g. The operations demonstrated synergy and jointness among civilian leadership, the military, Intelligence agencies, police and paramilitary organisations in planning and conducting warfare. h. The failure of Pakistan\u2019s long-standing policy of bleeding India by a thousand cuts. i. The operations successfully exposed the nuclear bluff of Pakistan and highlighted India\u2019s capability to control the escalation ladder. 9. India once again agreed to a ceasefire from a position of strength, which is considered a strategic move. However, India\u2019s diplomatic, informational, military and economic coercion will continue to prevent the adversary from reorganising, funding and supporting terrorist networks. Let this be the beginning of the end of the terror state of Pakistan. How a Kannada priest set out to make India's first certified AI film Evolving luxury"

The dispute began when a section of state government employees approached the Calcutta High Court, seeking DA parity with central government employees, including arrears. In May 2022, the high court directed the state to pay DA at the central rate. However, the West Bengal government challenged this decision in the Supreme Court, filing an appeal in November 2022. Since then, the case has experienced multiple hearings and adjournments, often due to scheduling conflicts and bench reassignments. Meanwhile, the West Bengal government has announced incremental increases in DA on a few occasions, though they have not matched the central rates and a gap of 37 per cent still remains. The case was initially being heard by a bench led by Justice Hrishikesh Roy, but it had to be reassigned after his retirement. On Wednesday, it was to be heard by the division bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and Manoj Misra following a recent reassignment from the bench led by Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol, and Sandeep Mehta on May 11. On Wednesday, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, the state government counsel was busy in the hearing of another case.

The last hearing in the matter took place on December 1, 2024. The Supreme Court had stated that a detailed hearing was necessary to address the issue of DA for state employees, assuring that all parties would be heard thoroughly.

            "text": "Justice Bhushan Ramkrishna Gavai was sworn in as the 52nd Chief Justice of India at Rashtrapati Bhavan earlier today Justice Bhushan Ramkrishna Gavai stood with quiet pride at Rashtrapati Bhavan on Wednesday as he was sworn in as the 52nd Chief Justice of India. By his side were his 84-year-old mother, Kamaltai, along with his wife, daughter, and son, their beaming smiles reflecting a journey marked by resilience, love, and an inspiring rise from the slums of Amravati to the highest echelons of the Indian judiciary. The Chief Justice of India touched his mother\u2019s feet after taking oath. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was also seen going upto the CJI\u2019s mother to greet her. As the first Buddhist and second dalit Chief Justice after Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, Gavai\u2019s rise is a testament to grit and the transformative power of B.R. Ambedkar\u2019s legacy. Born on November 24, 1960, in Amravati, Maharashtra, Gavai grew up in a modest home steeped in social activism. His father, Ramkrishna known as Dadasaheb Gavai, a prominent Ambedkarite and former governor, inspired his commitment to equality. His mother, Kamaltai, a schoolteacher, instilled discipline and empathy, ensuring young Bhushan helped with chores despite their humble circumstances. Justice Gavai studied in a municipal school, sitting on the floor in classrooms without benches. He earned commerce and law degrees from Amravati University. Joining the Bar in 1985, he honed his skills under Raja S. Bhonsale, a former advocate general, before practising independently at the Bombay High Court. Elevated to the Bombay High Court in 2003, Gavai served across its benches, earning respect for his fairness. In 2019, he joined the Supreme Court, where he authored landmark rulings on demonetisation, Article 370, and electoral bonds. His 2024 opinion on sub-classification within Scheduled Castes, rooted in his own experiences, championed nuanced equity. \u201cNot all start from the same point,\u201d he wrote, echoing his belief in justice that uplifts the marginalised. On his first day as the Chief Justice of India, Gavai paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi and Ambedkar\u2019s statues at the Supreme Court, a nod to their ideals of unity and equality. Both sitting and retired judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts attended the ceremony. Gavai also plans to convene a meeting of all judges to outline his vision, discuss the way forward, and invite suggestions. With just about 10 days remaining before the court\u2019s annual summer recess, the court will still function partially, with at least three Benches continuing to hear cases during the break.

The announcement was made by Dr Jitendra Singh, Minister of State for Science and Technology and Earth Sciences, during his visit to the border areas in Kathua. He gave full credit to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the major improvements in security and development along the border since 2014. \u201cIt is due to PM Modi\u2019s vision and decisive leadership that the people living in vulnerable border belts now feel secure,\u201d Dr Singh said. \u201cThese additional 600 bunkers are part of that larger national security and welfare plan.\u201d The 600 new bunkers will be in addition to the 2,000 already built in the Kathua district. The decision comes after a strong public demand after the success of the bunker system during Operation Sindoor, when many residents took shelter in these secure structures instead of moving to distant relief camps. Each bunker is designed like a small flat, complete with basic facilities. They offer both comfort and safety during shelling from across the border. Dr Singh also announced an automated centralised siren system that will provide real-time alerts in case of emergencies. He directed officials to start construction of the new bunkers immediately and ensure that the siren system is operational as soon as possible. Kathua was the first district in India to introduce family bunkers along the border, a move initiated by Dr Singh after PM Modi came to power in 2014. During the four-day-long escalation between India and Pakistan following Operation Sindoor, 25 civilians, including six security personnel and an Additional Deputy Commissioner of Rajouri, were killed in Pakistani shelling. In north Kashmir\u2019s Uri (Baramulla district), a woman was killed, and hundreds of people along the border were displaced due to the shelling. In Poonch and Rajouri alone, more than 200 houses were damaged, with several businesses and vehicles also affected.

In Saudi Arabia for the first leg of his Middle East tour, Trump suggested that India and Pakistan should \"have a nice dinner together\" to help ease tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours. He also sought credit for brokering peace to avert a \"potential nuclear war\" between India and Pakistan, which he said could have killed millions. \"I think they're actually getting along.

Observers and experts believe that Trump's stance isn't helping, considering that he praised Pakistan along with India, while not confronting how the terror attack at Pahalgam had triggered the conflict. \"When Mr. Trump comes in and says, you know, \u2018I spoke to both sides,\u2019 he\u2019s kind of equating,\" said Nirupama Menon Rao, a former Indian ambassador to Washington, told The New York Post. She added that Trump's approach has only made the matter complex for India, which wants to be \"viewed independently and not through the lens of conflict with Pakistan\". \"India and Pakistan are being hyphenated once again,\" Rao said. \"India had genuinely felt that we had broken free of that hyphenation and that Pakistan had kind of receded into the shadows as far as the U.S. was concerned,\" she added. While Pakistan had lavished praise on Trump for his intervention, many in India, including those close to the Centre, had not approved of the ceasefire. Analysts feel Trump did not bash Pakistan enough for its role. \"The last few days have been hard on India. India\u2019s battles against Pakistan-sponsored terror have been invariably lonely ones,\u201d Indrani Bagchi, a New Delhi-based foreign policy analyst, said on X. \"The U.S. and China may be strategic rivals everywhere. But they come together in Pakistan. That reality has not changed,\" she added. Michael Kugelman, a foreign policy analyst, told the BBC that India has interpreted the ceasefire differently from the US and Pakistan. \"Also, since it was put together so hastily, the accord may lack the proper guarantees and assurances one would need at such a tense moment,\" Kugelman added.

Mohammed Salim and Biman Bose were among the senior leaders who took to the streets and led the march from Esplanade to Sealdah in central Kolkata under the banner of \u201cmarch for peace and harmony\u201d. Since India launched the \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019, both the leaders have been advocating for deescalation.

However, instead of escalating to war, it is now time for negotiation and diplomacy,\u201d the former Left Front chairman said.

It believes diplomatic pressure should be applied on Pakistan, but not at the cost of escalating war, which could have grave consequences. They also welcomed the decision of ceasefire between India and Pakistan but strongly criticised US President Donald Trump\u2019s involvement. The Left reiterated that India's long-standing position has been to resolve the Kashmir issue bilaterally with Pakistan, without third-party mediation. The Left asserted that the principle was affirmed in the Simla Agreement and questioned why the Indian government appears to be deviating from this stance, demanding an explanation from the Narendra Modi government. This was the second such anti-war rally after intellectuals, civil society members and some left student organisations hit the streets in Kolkata on Monday.

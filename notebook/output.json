            "text": "A new low-cost counter drone system 'Bhargavastra', has been designed and developed by Solar Defence and Aerospace Limited (SDAL), signifying a substantial leap in countering the escalating threat of drone swarms. The micro rockets used in this counter-drone system underwent rigorous testing at the Seaward Firing Range, Gopalpur, achieving all designated objectives.Three trials were conducted for the rocket at Gopalpur on May 13 in presence of senior officials of the Army. Two trials were conducted by firing one rocket each. One trial was conducted by firing two rockets in salvo mode within 2 seconds. All four rockets performed as expected and achieved the required launch parameters underscoring its pioneering technology in mitigating large-scale drone attacks, said Solar Defence and Aerospace Limited in a statement. The S-400 missile defence system proved highly effective during the recent India-Pakistan conflict, particularly in Operation Sindoor, where it played a crucial role in intercepting and neutralising Pakistani aerial threats. Indian defence sources and official statements confirm that the S-400 successfully detected, tracked, and intercepted multiple Pakistani missiles, drones, and aircraft targeting various strategic locations along India's western border, including Jammu, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Gujarat.The widespread availability of affordable drones, particularly in swarm formations, presents significant challenges to armed forces traditionally reliant on costly air defence missiles for asset protection.There is a pressing need for cost-effective systems targeting drone threats, whilst preserving advanced air defence systems for more substantial threats.

So what was actually taking place? No one really knew. Even the governments weren't really sure what was going on because no one could really understand unless you were quite literally living in these villages that were getting attacked.\"So I think that probably created more of the anxiety. I think there was a lot of talk around why we shouldn't be playing. It's not a great time to be playing, first and foremost, but also we're quite close to what's being fought over.\"Who's that IPL player?Uncertainty over Punjab Kings playersA couple of days ago, Punjab Kings CEO Satish Menon was convinced that their Australian contingent, including Marcus Stoinis, Josh Inglis, Xavier Bartlett, and Aaron Hardie, who returned home, would return.However, it is now understood that they, too, are unwilling to come back. Punjab will take on Rajasthan Royals on Sunday at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur. It is also reliably learned that head coach Ricky Ponting, who stepped out after boarding the flight once he heard the announcement of a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, is trying to convince the Australian players to return to India.The Punjab Kings contingent reached Jaipur on Wednesday and will resume their training from Thursday."

The attempt was to both embarrass India and also extract sensitive information about its defence systems, including its missiles, they said.According to Interpol trainer and cyber forensic expert Pendyala Krishna Shastry, the attacks were part of a broader campaign waged by Pakistani actors against Indian digital assets. These groups reportedly deployed malware, conducted phishing attacks, and launched denial-of-service operations targeting critical sectors such as finance, telecom, energy, and public services.Zone-H, a website that tracks defacements, reported incidents involving Indian govt domains.

This news follows reports of Apple considering iPhone price hikes, possibly linked to tariffs. President Donald Trump told reporters that he talked to Apple CEO Tim Cook after the US-China trade agreement at Geneva. US and China have agreed to suspend most tariffs for 90 days. \u201cI spoke to Tim Cook this morning, and he\u2019s going to, I think, even up his numbers,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office of Whote House. \"$500 billion, he\u2019s going to be building a lot of plants in the United States for Apple. And we look forward to that.\" Incidentally, Apple CEO Cook had successfully lobbied Trump during his first administration to exempt some of the company\u2019s products from tariffs.Wall Street and Apple investors cheered the pause on Chinese tariffs. Apple stock was up 6% in trading on Monday, versus 3% for the Nasdaq. The dramatic coolinUS and China, spurred a broader rally across US markets. Earlier in the day a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report claimed that Apple is considering to raise prices for its iPhone lineup likely to launch in September. The USJ report cited people familiar with the matter whom it didn\u2019t identify. The company is exploring whether to \u201ccouple\u201d price increases with new features and designs, while trying to avoid the perception that any hikes are tied to US tariffs, the Journal reported. A few hours after the Journal report, Donald Trump said that he had spoken to Tim Cook. He, however, didn\u2019t address the potential price increases. Trump just focused on how he thinks the company will end up raising its US spending plan beyond the $500 billion that it had pledged in February. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be building a lot of plants in the US for Apple,\u201d Trump said. Apple hasn\u2019t changed the starting price of its flagship iPhone model since it launched its tenth-anniversary iPhone -- iPhone X in 2017 \u2014 keeping it at $999. However, there have been wide speculations that the company may increase prices after Trump announced sweeping tariffs against several nations that Apple relies on for manufacturing. Earlier this year, Apple went with a higher price for the iPhone 16e, which replaced the budget iPhone SE in its lineup, signaling what analysts says its willingness to raise costs when needed. Cook said during a recent earnings call that it could incur costs of about $900 million this quarter due to tariffs. He was asked about potential price increases during the same call but promptly shut down the question, saying: \u201cWe have nothing to announce today.\u201dThe WSJ report added that high-end iPhones, including the Pro and Pro Max models, will be produced in China, even as Apple builds up capacity in Indian factories. According to Bloomberg report, Apple is seeking to import most of the iPhones it sells in the US from India by the end of next year, accelerating a shift beyond China to mitigate risks related to tariffs and geopolitical tensions."

Whether it\u2019s a gritty fifty on a crumbling pitch or a match-turning five-wicket haul, the 36-year-old has become a pillar of India's Test side. But while Jadeja's place at the top remains unshaken, Bangladesh\u2019s Mehidy Hasan Miraz is quietly making headlines of his own. Following a phenomenal Test series against Zimbabwe, where he scored 116 runs and claimed 15 wickets, Miraz climbed to No. 2 in the all-rounder rankings. His career-best rating of 327 puts him just 73 points behind Jadeja, adding an exciting edge to the next few Test series. The rankings also saw significant movement across the board. Bangladesh's Test win in Chattogram spurred leaps for players like Taijul Islam and Shadman Islam, while England's Joe Root remained the No. 1 batter. Jasprit Bumrah, meanwhile, retained his crown as the world\u2019s top Test bowler.Still, the spotlight firmly belongs to Jadeja. In an era dominated by specialists, his prolonged excellence with both bat and ball has redefined what it means to be a modern all-rounder\u2014and now, he's officially the greatest in that role Test cricket has ever seen."

            "text": "NEW DELHI: Soon after Pakistan returned BSF jawan Purnam Kumar Shaw on Wednesday, India also released a Pakistani rangers trooper who had been in custody for nearly after two weeks. The exchange took place at the Attari-Wagah border near Amritsar.The Pakistani Ranger had been apprehended by BSF personnel near the international border in Rajasthan\u2019s Sriganganagar district. Do you believe the recent exchange of soldiers between India and Pakistan will help reduce tensions between the two countries? BSF jawan Shaw had \"inadvertently\" crossed into Pakistani territory on April 23 around 11:50am while on operational duty in the Ferozepur sector, officials said. He was subsequently detained by the Pakistan Rangers.Following his return on Wednesday, officials informed PTI news agency that Shaw will undergo a complete medical examination, followed by counselling and a formal debriefing session where BSF officials will question him about his 21-day detention in Pakistan.Shaw, a member of the 24th BSF Battalion, will not be immediately assigned to active duty. He will also be part of an official inquiry initiated by the Punjab frontier of the BSF to investigate the circumstances of his detention and identify any procedural lapses.A BSF spokesperson confirmed that the handover at the Attari-Wagah border was carried out peacefully and in line with established protocols. He credited regular flag meetings and continued communication between the BSF and Pakistan Rangers for facilitating the jawan's repatriation.Shaw\u2019s detention came just a day after the Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed 26 lives.This reciprocal gesture followed weeks of heightened tension between India and Pakistan, triggered by the April 22 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s Pahalgam and India's subsequent counterterror operation, codenamed Operation Sindoor.A ceasefire agreement was announced last Saturday, with both sides agreeing to halt all military actions across land, air, and water."

The precision strikes targeted key infrastructure, including drone warfare command centers and aircraft deployment hubs. NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force (IAF), in a precision-led campaign between May 8 to 10, had conducted strikes on 11 military air bases across Pakistan. The satellite images of the strikes showed extensive damage caused to the neighbouring nation.The bases hit included Nur Khan (Chaklala), Rafiqui, Murid, Sukkur, Sialkot, Pasrur, Chunian, Sargodha, Skardu, Bholari, and Jacobabad. These sites were chosen for their operational importance, including drone warfare command centres, air defence nodes, and aircraft deployment hubs. Earlier on Sunday, in a rare joint press briefing by all three defence services, Air Marshal AK Bharti emphasized that the Indian response was deliberately focused on high-value targets. \u201cA decision was taken to strike where it would hurt,\u201d he said, outlining how Indian forces carried out a swift, coordinated, and calibrated assault on key Pakistani military infrastructure. The targets included airbases at Chaklala, Rafiq, and Rahim Yar Khan, followed by strikes on Sargodha, Bhulari, and Jacobabad. These strikes, Bharti added, were meant to send a clear message: \u201cAggression will not be tolerated.\u201dBharti also confirmed that the Indian Air Force thwarted an attempted breach of Indian airspace by Pakistani fighter jets following India\u2019s cross-border counterterror strikes under \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019.\u201cTheir planes were prevented from entering our borders. We have definitely downed a few planes and inflicted losses on their side,\u201d Bharti said, assuring that all Indian pilots involved in the operation had returned safely.The briefing came as all three wings of India\u2019s armed forces shed light on Operation Sindoor, the large-scale military response launched on May 7 following the Pakistan-backed terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s Pahalgam that killed 26 people.Some of the images of the strikes are as follows:SargodhaNow called Mushaf air base, it suffered air damage in indian strikes. It's the Command Headquarters of PAF and is home to various squadrons of F-16, JF-16, and Mirage 5A. Chaklala Airfield (NUR KHAN)The most significant target, previously known as Chaklala, located in Rawalpindi. It serves as the nerve centre for Pakistan's Air Mobility Command and houses its Saab Erieye airborne early warning systems, C-130 transporters, and IL-78 refuelling aircraft. Rafiqui Previously known as PAF Base Shorkot, it is a PAF airbase located near Shorkot, Jhang district, in Punjab province of Pakistan and is located at around 337 km south of Islamabad. Mirages and J-17s acquired from China are stationed. Murid It is an operational flying base of Sialkot Pakistan Air Force located near the village of Murid in Chakwal district of Punjab. It houses the UCAV and UAV fleet of the PAF, including Turkiye-made Bayraktar TB2s and Shahpar-I.

            "title": "Microsoft's second biggest layoffs: These are employees to be impacted",
            "text": "Microsoft will reduce its workforce by 3%. This affects about 7,000 employees globally. The company aims to streamline operations. Microsoft seeks a flatter structure. It prioritizes engineering talent for AI. New performance management includes a rehire ban. Microsoft follows an industry trend. Other tech firms also focus on efficiency. These changes follow better-than-expected quarterly results. Microsoft has announced that it will lay off 3% of its global workforce, affecting thousands of employees across all levels, teams, and geographies, amounting to over 6,000 employees. The cuts at the Redmond giant, which employed 228,000 people as of last June, aim to reduce management layers and streamline operations.\"We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in a statement.The latest round of job cuts Microsoft's largest reduction since eliminating 10,000 roles in 2023. Unlike January's smaller performance-based cuts, the company indicated these layoffs are structural in nature. These cuts may particularly impact middle management roles, as the company seeks to create a more streamlined hierarchy by increasing each manager's \"span of control.\" Microsoft, as reported by Business Insider previously, aims to prioritize engineering talent as it continues investing heavily in artificial intelligence initiatives.Sources told Business Insider that laid off employees will stay on the payroll for the 60 days after their termination. Further, the affected staff will also be reportedly eligible for rewards and bonuses. The workforce reduction comes amid significant changes to Microsoft's performance management system. According to internal documents viewed by Business Insider, the company has implemented a two-year rehire ban for employees forced out due to performance issues.Microsoft has also introduced a \"good attrition\" metric to track desirable employee departures. This approach mirrors Amazon's controversial \"unregretted attrition\" system and signals Microsoft's intent to more aggressively manage underperforming staff.Under the new system, employees facing performance issues must either enter a performance improvement plan (PIP) with \"clear expectations and a timeline for improvement\" or accept a \"Global Voluntary Separation Agreement\" with 16 weeks of severance pay. Those who choose the PIP path have just five days to decide and will no longer be eligible for the severance package if they opt for the improvement plan. Microsoft's restructuring reflects a broader trend across the tech industry toward flatter organizational structures and higher engineering efficiency. The company is reportedly focusing on reducing its \"PM ratio\" \u2014 the proportion of managers to engineers \u2014 across teams.Similar strategies have been implemented at other tech giants, including Amazon and Google, where the top layer of the hierarchy were let go. Meta is also expected to let go off several thousand employees this year, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg pushes for a \u201cyear of efficiency.\u201dThe layoffs follow Microsoft's better-than-expected quarterly results reported in April, when CEO Satya Nadella indicated the company would make sales execution changes after lower-than-expected growth in non-AI Azure cloud revenue."

            "title": "'Operation Sindoor exceeded aims, India achieved a massive victory'",
            "text": "Operation Sindoor marked a decisive shift in India\u2019s military doctrine, combining precision airstrikes with strategic restraint. West Point expert John Spencer called it an \u201cobjective victory,\u201d praising its clarity and execution. India destroyed terrorist infrastructure, neutralized Pakistani counterattacks, and redefined deterrence. The operation set a new red line, signaling India\u2019s resolve against state-backed terror without full-scale war. NEW DELHI: John Spencer, one of the world\u2019s foremost authorities on modern combat, has offered a stark and unqualified assessment of India's Operation Sindoor. \u201cAfter just four days of calibrated military action, it is objectively conclusive: India achieved a massive victory. Operation Sindoor met and exceeded its strategic aims\u2014destroying terrorist infrastructure, demonstrating military superiority, restoring deterrence, and unveiling a new national security doctrine. This was not symbolic force. It was decisive power, clearly applied,\u201d Spencer wrote in a post on X.A West Point scholar, author of Understanding Urban Warfare, and executive director of the Urban Warfare Institute, Spencer is known for his analytical rigor. His unequivocal language-\"objectively conclusive,\" \"decisive power\"-carried weight beyond social media, resonating in strategic circles far beyond South Asia. His statement also cuts to the core of what Operation Sindoor represents: Not just retaliation, but redefinition. India\u2019s airstrikes, executed with surgical precision on terror infrastructure inside Pakistan, marked the culmination of a doctrinal evolution that had been hinted at for years but never made explicit-until now. India\u2019s strategic transformation Operation Sindoor followed a brutal April 22 massacre in Pahalgam, Jammu & Kashmir, where 26 civilians were killed in an attack claimed by The Resistance Front, a Lashkar-e-Taiba offshoot. Unlike past incidents, New Delhi didn\u2019t issue diplomatic warnings or seek multilateral condemnation. Instead, it launched warplanes, Spencer said in his post.Over four tightly coordinated days beginning May 7, India carried out nine deep-penetration strikes, neutralized a retaliatory drone swarm from Pakistan, and hit six military airbases and UAV command hubs. In parallel, India\u2019s armed forces showcased their ability to defend airspace, deploy indigenous weapons systems, and apply multi-domain capabilities, including electronic and cyber warfare.What followed wasn\u2019t a ceasefire. It was, in the words of Indian military officials, a \u201cstrategic pause\u201d- an operational halt, not a concession.This measured yet forceful posture is precisely what Spencer highlighted. His post reflects a growing recognition among security experts: India is no longer content with reactive diplomacy. It is building a military doctrine rooted in calibrated force, autonomous escalation control, and refusal to be coerced by nuclear threats. Strategic objectives achieved As per Spencer, Operation Sindoor was not a war of conquest or vengeance but a limited campaign with clear objectives, all of which were met: India established that terrorist attacks from Pakistani soil will be treated as acts of war, setting a precedent for future responses.India\u2019s message, backed by action, is that terror attacks backed by state actors will be treated as acts of war. As PM Modi said, \u201cTerror and talks can\u2019t go together. Water and blood can\u2019t flow together.\u201d India\u2019s ability to strike terrorist and military targets at will, while neutralizing Pakistan\u2019s counterattacks, underscored a stark asymmetry in capabilities. By escalating deliberately and halting short of full-scale war, India signaled its control over the conflict\u2019s pace and scope. With Operation Sindoor, India unveiled a new national security doctrine, as articulated publicly by Prime Minister Narendra Modi: \u201cIndia will not tolerate any nuclear blackmail. India will strike precisely and decisively at the terrorist hideouts developing under the cover of nuclear blackmail.\u201dIndia\u2019s approach combined restraint with resolve. There was no attempt to occupy land or escalate into full-scale war. The goal was to inflict limited but meaningful costs on both non-state actors and the state that enables them-without opening the door to prolonged conflict.John Spencer understood this-and articulated it plainly: \u201cThis was not symbolic force.\u201d India\u2019s campaign comes at a time when democratic states are rethinking deterrence in an age of gray-zone threats and nuclear brinkmanship. As Israel grapples with asymmetrical warfare from Hamas and Hezbollah, as the US pivots to long-term competition with China, and as European states reconsider their military baselines post-Ukraine, the concept of \u201climited war with defined strategic aims\u201d is gaining salience.Meanwhile, India\u2019s military briefing to 70 nations the day after the strikes-including the exclusion of China and the demotion of Turkiye was no coincidence. China and Turkiye are major arms suppliers to Pakistan. It signaled that this was not just an event, but a precedent.The current pause is not an endpoint but a strategic hold. India has made clear that further provocations will trigger renewed action."

Man saves two from burning hot air balloon at Mexican festival, then falls to death A man tragically fell to his death during the First Balloon Festival in Zacatecas, Mexico, after rescuing two passengers from a hot air balloon that caught fire, according to local officials.The victim, identified only as 40-year-old Luicio N, was participating in the Enrique Estrada 2025 Fair when the balloon caught fire while still on the ground. According to Riviera Maya News, Luicio helped two passengers escape the burning basket but became entangled in a rope attached to the balloon, which lifted off with him dangling beneath it.Horrifying footage captured the balloon rising as flames engulfed its lower half, with thick black smoke trailing behind. As the balloon floated higher, Luicio was seen clinging to a rope below the burning basket before finally falling to his death. Rodrigo Reyes Mug\u00fcerza, secretary general of Zacatecas, confirmed the death and called it \u201can unfortunate incident.\u201d He added in a social media statement, \u201cImmediately, authorities rushed to the scene to provide care and support to the affected people.\u201d Two injured passengers were treated for first-degree burns at a local hospital, according to the New York Post.

A Pakistani journalist faced a sharp rebuff from the US state department official after attempting to question Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s stance on de-escalation talks between India and Pakistan. During a briefing on Wednesday, the Pakistani journalist portrayed former US President Donald Trump as a peace broker in the India-Pakistan standoff and claimed that India, particularly PM Modi, did not welcome Trump\u2019s supposed ceasefire efforts.\"Pakistan welcomed President Trump's efforts for bringing the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, and they believe that President Trump could win a Nobel Peace Prize if he were to bring peace between Pakistan and India on the Kashmir issue.

That's where our focus remains. And we want to see a ceasefire be maintained, and we want to encourage direct communication. That is our focus here. Our focus is the ceasefire,\u201d he said. Pigott reiterated that both India and Pakistan should maintain direct communication and pursue peace.While Trump has repeatedly claimed that his administration facilitated the India-Pakistan ceasefire, India has asserted that it was Pakistan\u2019s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) who reached out to his Indian counterpart seeking a truce, driven by pressure after Indian strikes.

He values peace. He's also a dealmaker, and he has shown that again and again and again in terms of both pursuing an America First agenda but also pursuing peace and wanting to see peace and conflicts come to an end,\" Pigott said.The journalist also brought up the use of Israeli drones by India during Operation Sindoor and questioned whether that might create complications between Pakistan and Israel, given Trump's Abraham Accords aimed at fostering ties among Jews, Muslims, and Christians.Pigott, however, steered the conversation back to Washington\u2019s stated priorities: maintaining the ceasefire and encouraging direct dialogue between India and Pakistan. He reiterated that the US focus remains on resolving conflicts through peaceful means."

Do you believe that derogatory comments against women in uniform should be condemned? \"Dear Colonel Sofiya Qureshi is a proud daughter of this nation, a sister of all country-loving Indians, who has served the country with courage and dedication,\" she stated, noting that the entire nation takes pride in courageous women like her and such demeaning comments warrant firm condemnation.The Congress circulated a video showing Shah allegedly making inappropriate comments, stating, \"'Jinhone humari betiyon ke sindoor ujade the\u2026 humne unhiki behen bhej kar ke unki aisi ki taisi karwayi (those who wiped vermilion off our daughters' forehead... we sent their sister to teach them a lesson)'.\"Subsequently, Shah issued a statement saying, \"If my words have hurt society and religion, then I am ready to apologise ten times.\"Colonel Qureshi participated in the tri-services press briefings regarding Operation Sindoor, alongside Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh. The military action was initiated following a terrorist attack in Pahalgam resulting in 26 casualties."

Family cited a neurological disorder and medication, while a preliminary report suggests pancreatic hemorrhage. Police are investigating the circumstances, including possible drug overdose or poisoning, noting scratch marks and recording statements from friends present at the flat. KOLKATA: Srinjoy Dasgupta, 25, the stepson of former BJP state president Dilip Ghosh, was found dead under mysterious circumstances at his home in New Town on Tuesday. He apparently died hours after partying with a group of friends at the flat.Family members said he had a history of neurological disorder and was under regular medication. A preliminary post-mortem report hinted at acute pancreatic haemorrhage as the possible reason for death.Police said Dasgupta, nicknamed Pritam, was found unconscious and frothing from his mouth by one of the friends. The domestic help, upon seeing his state, called neighbours and his mother, Rinku Majumdar, who rushed him to a local hospital in her car where he was declared dead on arrival.Srinjoy, a software engineer associated with an MNC, lived in a second-floor flat of building number 409 at the Sukhabrishti housing complex in New Town. Prior to her marriage to Ghosh, Majumdar \u2014 a Mahila Morcha functionary \u2014 also lived in the same flat. After she married Ghosh on April 18, she shifted to Ghosh's bungalow at Ideal Villas in New Town.\"On Tuesday, their domestic help called me and said Pritam was unconscious. About a year and a half ago, he lost consciousness once. He was under medication for a neurological condition. But I believe he wasn't taking his medication properly for a while,\" Majumdar told reporters.\"He didn't say it out loud, but he wanted to stay with me. He wanted to build a house where we all would stay together. I told him the house can come later, but he should start living here first. He was happy that we would be together. But see what has happened,\" she broke down.Ghosh regretted: \"It's my misfortune that I didn't experience the joy of having a son, but now I face the sorrow of losing one. I can't comprehend how everything changed so drastically.\"At Sukhabrishti apartment, a neighbour, Anamika Roy, said there were a few friends who stayed back at his flat on Monday night. \"When I went in, I saw one of his friends rubbing his feet and trying to wake him up. I also tried to wake him, but he was unresponsive. Some time later, his mother came and they took him to a hospital,\" said Anamika Roy, a neighbour.He was first taken to Ohio Hospital in New Town. A source at the hospital told TOI that in addition to signs of high alcohol consumption, he was frothing from the mouth, which led to the suspicion that there was either a drug overdose or some form of poisoning, and they called the cops. Police shifted the body first to Bidhannagar Subdivisional Hospital and then to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital for the post-mortem.Probing into the case, police said they found some medicines next to Srinjoy's pillow. \"We are recording the statement of his friends,\" said a senior officer. \"There were also some scratch marks on his shoulder. We are checking the injuries as well.\"Srinjoy's father, Raja Dasgupta \u2014 Majumdar's former husband \u2014 also came to the hospital but refused to speak to reporters."

This group, part of the Reich Citizens movement, rejects the legitimacy of the German republic. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt banned the group, accusing it of establishing a 'counter-state' with criminal economic structures and antisemitic narratives. A spokeswoman for Germany's Federal Prosecutor's Office said the founder of the \"Reich Citizens\" subgroup \"Kingdom of Germany,\" Peter Fitzek, had been taken into custody on Thursday. Fitzek and three other suspected ringleaders of the group, part of a conspiracy theorist movement that rejects the legitimacy of the modern German republic, were arrested.What do we know about the 'Kingdom of Germany' arrests?Police on Tuesday conducted raids on the properties of key members of the group in seven German states, making four arrests. The swoop came after Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt banned what is currently the largest group of so-called Reich Citizens. He accused the \"Kingdom of Germany\" of trying to establish a \"counter-state\" within Germany.Security authorities believe Fitzek to have founded the group in 2012, ruling as the self-declared monarch of the \"Kingdom.\"Justifying the ban on the group, Dobrindt said, \"The members of this association have created a 'counter-state' in our country and built up criminal economic structures.\"\"In this way, they undermine the rule of law and the Federal Republic's monopoly on the legitimate use of force,\" he added. \"At the same time, they use antisemitic conspiracy narratives to back up their supposed claim to authority.\" The ban also includes associated splinter groups. What is the 'Kingdom of Germany' group?According to Dobrindt, the \"Kingdom of Germany\" group, which reportedly has around 6,000 members, is the biggest association within the Reichsb\u00fcrger scene, whose supporters deny the legitimacy of Germany's post-World War II Federal Republic.This attitude leads some members to refuse demands made by legal authorities, such as fines and taxes. They have also been known to print their own passports and driver's licenses.Security authorities in Germany have paid increased attention to the movement in recent years amid fears of its violent potential.Most notably, a plot to overthrow the German government was uncovered in late 2022. Its planners are said to have intended to raid the German parliament and arrest key politicians before installing an interim government.Some 27 people were charged in connection with the plot, and 380 firearms were found. Three major trials on terrorism and conspiracy charges began in late April 2024.The Tuesday raids took place in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia."

(AI image for representative purpose only) Amidst a push for \u2018Atmanirbhar Bharat\u2019, India\u2019s defence exports reached a record high of Rs 23,622 crore (approximately $2.76 billion) in the last financial year 2024-25. Compared to the previous fiscal year's figure of Rs 21,083 crore, this represents an increase of Rs 2,539 crore, equivalent to a 12.04% growth.India\u2019s defence exports are in focus amidst the India-Pakistan tensions. Indian military forces carried out Operation Sindoor on terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir in retaliation to the Pahalgam terror attack. India also struck several airbases of Pakistan as the neighbouring country launched drone attacks.The success of Operation Sindoor has brought to light the accuracy of \u2018Make in India\u2019 weapon systems. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) posted on X (formerly Twitter), \u201cIndia exports to around 80 countries aiming for \u20b950,000 crore in exports by 2029, strengthening its global defence manufacturing footprint.\u201d Compared to a revenue of Rs 686 crore in FY 2013-14, the FY 2024-25 number of Rs 23,622 crore is a 34 times increase, the MoD said. The export performance of Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs) has demonstrated substantial improvement with a 42.85% increase in FY 2024-25, indicating strong international acceptance of Indian defence products and the sector's capability to integrate into global supply networks, a previous MoD release said in April. In FY 2024-25, private sector contributions amounted to Rs 15,233 crore, whilst DPSUs generated Rs 8,389 crore in exports. These figures show an improvement from FY 2023-24, when private sector exports stood at Rs 15,209 crore and DPSU exports at Rs 5,874 crore.According to the Ministry of Defence, India has transformed its military capabilities, shifting from heavy import dependence to a focus on domestic manufacturing and self-sufficiency. It has made significant strides in defence exports, successfully delivering diverse military equipment including ammunition, weaponry, systems, subsystems, and various components.The Defence Production Department maintains a specialised online platform for managing export authorisation applications. The department issued 1,762 Export Authorisations in FY 2024-25, showing an increase from 1,507 in the previous year, marking a 16.92% rise. Additionally, the number of defence exporters increased by 17.4% during this period.The Government has implemented numerous policy changes in recent years to strengthen India's defence sector, MoD said. These include streamlining industrial licensing processes, deregulating components from licensing requirements, and lengthening license validity periods. Furthermore, during the previous financial year, the Standard Operating Procedure for export authorisation underwent simplification, with additional provisions introduced to enhance the country's export capabilities."

Despite initial setbacks, including the CPS's initial decision not to press charges and her own withdrawal of the case, she persevered. A woman in the United Kingdom recalled her harrowing memories, alleging that her former husband had drugged, raped and took photographs when she was unconscious. In a report by the BBC, the woman said that her husband has been abusive and controlling in private. To hide the identity of the victim, the BBC gave her the name \"Kate.\"She told that one evening her husband had been drugging her tea at night with sleeping medication so he could rape her while she was unconscious and taking photographs of his assaults. Speechless and frozen by disbelief, Kate struggled to comprehend the enormity of his betrayal.For years, her husband had been abusive and controlling in private. His behavior was violent and he frequently misused prescription medications.Kate said there had been times when she woke up during non-consensual sexual acts, which her husband would later dismiss as unintentional, claiming he was asleep and unwell.Following his confession, he pleaded with Kate not to go to the police, fearing his life would be over. Initially, Kate remained silent, however, over the months, she became very ill and started having panic attacks.Kate said that nearly a year later, she confided in her sister, who immediately called their mother. Their mother then called the police, and her ex-husband was arrested and questioned. However, just four days later, she withdrew the case overwhelmed by grief. \u201cI just wasn't ready.\"Six months later after her husband moved out of the house, Kate returned to the police.Kate told BBC that the detective explained to her that she was a survivor of a serious crime and empowered her to reclaim what had been taken. He clearly explained that what she had endured was rape.Her ex-husband's medical records provided undeniable evidence. After his confession to Kate, he had privately consulted a psychiatrist, during which he admitted to \"drugging his wife in order to have sex with her while she was asleep.\"Despite this compelling evidence, the crown prosecution service (CPS) initially decided not to press charges. Determined, she applied for a formal review of the decision. Six months later, the CPS reversed its stance and said that her ex-husband will now be charged.The case finally went to court in 2022, five long years after his initial confession. Following a week-long trial, the jury found him found guilty of rape, sexual assault by penetration and administering a substance with intent. The sentencing judge described him as a \"self-obsessed person\" lacking genuine remorse and sentenced him to 11-years in prison, along with a lifelong restraining order.Kate could draw similarities between her and Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s case, the French woman who was drugged and raped by her ex-husband, who also hired dozens of men to abuse her."

The blasts, stemming from a prior dispute between student groups, triggered protests against alleged administrative apathy. Police are investigating, reviewing CCTV footage, and a forensic team is collecting samples. PATNA: A violent altercation between two student groups at B N College in Patna escalated into chaos on Tuesday afternoon when crude bombs were hurled on campus, disrupting examinations and leaving a student severely injured. The injured student, identified as Sujit Pandey, son of Dharmendra Pandey from Bhaluni Dham village in Rohtas district, was rushed to the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) for treatment.The incident took place around 12.45pm, while students were appearing for their Certified Internal Auditor (CIA) examination. According to eyewitnesses, a sudden explosion rocked the corridor of the examination block, sending students into a panic. Within minutes, a second bomb was hurled\u2014this time reportedly striking a student after hitting the wall and the iron grill near the college gate.\"People were writing their papers when a loud blast rang through the corridor. The atmosphere turned chaotic, with students running in different directions. Just as we were being evacuated, another explosion occurred, hitting a student on the head,\" an eyewitness said. Soon after the blasts, students blocked the busy Ashok Rajpath road, raising slogans against the college administration. The protestors alleged administrative apathy, claiming repeated inaction against violent and disruptive elements on campus. The police later pacified the students and cleared the road. Pirbahore police, led by SHO Abdul Haleem, reached the college and launched an investigation. \"Two crude bombs exploded during the exam. A forensic team has been called to collect samples, and CCTV footage from the campus is being scrutinised to identify those involved,\" the SHO said. He further added that no arrests have been made as yet.Initial investigation suggests the violence was rooted in a previous confrontation between hostel residents of the college. \"This appears to be a continuation of a dispute between two student groups. A few days ago, a similar altercation had been pacified by police's intervention. Unfortunately, the situation escalated today due to the failure of the college administration to monitor student activities and prevent dangerous materials from being brought onto campus,\" the SHO said.College principal Rajkishore Prasad expressed concern over the repeated disturbances on the campus. \"The blasts occurred at 12.45pm and 12.48pm. A student was injured. It is troubling that some students entered the examination hall without valid ID cards. Strict disciplinary action will be taken against those found involved,\" he said."

            "text": "Jose \"Pepe\" Mujica, Uruguay's former president, was celebrated for his humble lifestyle and progressive policies, including legalizing gay marriage and abortion. A former guerrilla, he donated most of his salary and lived on a farm, embodying his belief that happiness lies in contentment, not material wealth. Supporters gather outside a Movimiento de Participaci\u00f3n Popular political party headquarters, decorated with a photo of late former Uruguayan President Jos\u00e9 Mujica, after his death in Montevideo, Uruguay (Image: AP) Jose Mujica, widely known by his nickname, \"Pepe,\" was beloved for his modesty and progressive social reforms. At the height of his political career as president of Uruguay, Mujica's monthly salary was $12,500 (\u20ac7,200) \u2014 but he only drew one-tenth of it.The rest he gave away.$1,250 was \"more than enough,\" said Mujica, who would usually drive himself around in his pale-blue VW Beetle, which he refused to sell even when offered $1 million for it.This farmer from the west of the capital, Montevideo, never anticipated that he would one day achieve such popularity \u2014 and it was probably never his goal.He told DW back in 2015, just before the end of his presidency, that he was a political animal.\"I've been in politics since I was 14 years old,\" he said. \"And if I don't lose my wits, I'll continue in politics until they carry me out feet first.\" Jose Mujica was born in Montevideo in 1935 to a farming family of Basque and Italian origin.Their circumstances were modest: Mujica was five when his father died, and he and his sister worked on the family flower farm from an early age.He did go to school, though, and went on to study law, later dropping out as he became increasingly involved in the student movement. From 1973 to 1985, Uruguay was under a military dictatorship.When this came to an end, an amnesty law was passed under which saw Mujica and other political prisoners freed.He and his future wife, Luc\u00eda Topolansky, a fellow Tupamara released at the same time, moved to a small farm where they sold tomatoes and chrysanthemums and engaged in political activity.The Tupamaros evolved into the left-wing political party Movimiento de Participaci\u00f3n Popular (Movement of Popular Participation, or MPP), and 10 years after his release from prison, Mujica was elected as a member of parliament.A popular story relates that, on his first day, he traveled to parliament by moped. The porter, mistaking him for a courier, asked, \"Are you staying long?\" and Mujica replied, \"I hope so.\"His hopes were fulfilled. In 2005, for the first time in its history, Uruguay elected a socialist president: Tabare Vazquez, the leader of the left-wing coalition Frente Amplio (Broad Front). He appointed Jose Mujica as his minister of agriculture.Five years later, in 2010, Mujica was elected president with 52% of the vote. Even in the highest office of the state, Mujica remained true to himself. He often appeared at Cabinet meetings wearing a cardigan, sandals and an old pair of trousers. He never wore a tie, not even on official occasions. He did wear a three-piece suit as a guest at the White House in 2014, but it was slightly too short.In spite of this \u2014 or perhaps because of it \u2014 his host Barack Obama, US president at the time, described him as having \"extraordinary credibility.\"The renowned Uruguayan journalist Eduardo Galeano once said of his Mujica: \"He's a plain man. People recognize themselves in him, which is why he inspires such enthusiasm and hope.\" As president, Mujica, an avowed atheist, turned the country upside down. He legalized gay marriage and abortion, a move that was well ahead of the prevailing times in Latin America.In Mujica's logic, this act was neither leftist nor liberal. \"The world has to accept certain things that are unalterable,\" he said.His socioeconomic policies were also a success. Under his leadership, unemployment, poverty and infant mortality all decreased.His most controversial project was probably the deregulation of cannabis for recreational purposes. Mujica believed that this was something that could be tested in a small country like Uruguay.But he wasn't able to implement all of his plans. His much-trumpeted education reform fell by the wayside, as did major infrastructure projects. He also had to deal with accusations from fellow leftists that he cozied up to major corporations on issues around agriculture and natural resources. Nevertheless, because of his modest style, Mujica \u2014 unlike so many other Latin American heads of state \u2014 was generally deemed to be above suspicion of corruption.His approachability and pragmatism were probably also why he was excused many a verbal slip, such as when he called FIFA officials \"a bunch of old sons of bitches\" after his national team was knocked out of the World Cup.After the end of his presidency in 2015, Mujica mediated in the peace negotiations between the Colombian government and that country's FARC guerrillas in Cuba the following year.He continued to contribute to political debate until shortly beforehis death in May 2025 from cancer, at the age of 89.Mujica would also comment on current political issues on DW's Spanish service, where he had a special program entitled \"Conciencia Sur\" (\"The conscience of the South\"). He liked to receive journalists in the garden or study of his little house with the peeling facade.Jose \"Pepe\" Mujica was an atypical politician. By living as he did, he set an example for a new political culture.But he always refused to regard himself as poor. One of his most famous sayings was: \"It is not the man who has little, but the man who craves more, who is poor.\""

GURGAON: Four men allegedly shot dead the owner of a sweets shop in Farrukhnagar on Tuesday, less than 24 hours after he allegedly refused to deliver a samosa to an office nearby.Police said Rajesh Saini, a 27-year-old who managed the sweets shop near Jhajjar Chowk in Farrukhnagar, was hit by two bullets and died on the spot.After the shooting, it emerged that Saini and his family were unnerved after the argument with the accused on Monday and had told local police about the threats given to them.Cops said they have registered an FIR for murder against four accused -- Pankaj, a resident of Ismailpur in Faridabad, and three of his associates. According to the complaint, Pankaj went to Saini's shop on Monday evening and asked him to deliver a samosa to the office of a friend nearby. When Saini told him he does not run a delivery service, an argument ensued, and Pankaj walked out after threatening the shop owner of dire consequences.Pankaj came back to the shop with three associates on Tuesday afternoon and opened fire at Saini.\"The accused fired three to four bullets, and the victim was hit twice. We have booked all four men named by Saini's brother in his complaint, including Pankaj. Multiple police teams are raiding possible hideouts of the suspects, who will be nabbed soon. Since the investigation is on, we are yet to ascertain the weapon used in crime,\" a senior police officer said.The shooting triggered protests as other traders closed their shops in the area and accused police of inaction on Tuesday. Protesters also blocked the Farrukhnagar-Jhajjar Road, forcing police to divert traffic towards the bypass for three hours. The demonstration was called off after senior officers \u2013 Pataudi ACP Sukhbir Singh and Sadar ACP Yashwant Singh \u2013 reached the site and assured Saini's family that action will be taken against the accused. Cops also told them that 10 teams of the Crime Branch are working to trace the suspects. Asked if any action was taken against cops who did not pay heed to Saini's warning , Gurgaon police spokesperson Sandeep Kumar said no one has been suspended so far."

The 'Schitt's Creek' star, currently touring India, was presented with a personalized RR jersey by head coach Rahul Dravid. The Schitt's Creek star visited RR's training ground and met with Rahul Dravid, who gifted a customized jersey to the actor (Screengrab via X/@rajasthanroyals) Even though the Rajasthan Royals haven't had the best of campaigns this IPL, the Rahul Dravid led side are making the most of the window before the season enters its final stretch. Given the fact that RR is rooted to 9th spot and have just six points to show, RR's hopes of making it to the playoffs are near zero. However, an unexpected crossover ahead of the game against Punjab Kings on Sunday made for a light-hearted interaction between head coach Dravid and Canadian actor-comedian Eugene Levy. \"Schitt just got real! Eugene Levy is a Royal.\", posted RR on Instagram under a clip showing the actor and Dravid in conversation, as the former presents Levy with a customized RR kit that reads 'Levy'. The actor delightedly received the gift as he vowed to support the royals. He also claimed that RR is the first-ever cricket team that he'll be supporting. \"Now that you're a Rajasthan Royals fan, we've got a special gift for you.\" Dravid added, \"Hopefully you'll wear it with pride watching out games.\" Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!With a wide smile on his face, Levy replied, \"Well, there it is. I\u2019m a Royals fan. My first cricket team, and it will always be my first cricket team.\" The 78-year-old took the time to turn up at RR's training ground during his tour in the country."

            "text": "Smita Patil and Raj Babbar's love story began amidst challenges. Raj was already married. Smita faced backlash for her choices. Their relationship was filled with emotional turmoil. Smita gave birth to their son, Prateik. Sadly, she died soon after due to complications. Nadira Babbar showed remarkable strength. Raj still remembers Smita fondly. Their love story remains a poignant memory. In the golden era of parallel cinema, Smita Patil stood tall\u2014not just for her nuanced performances, but for the unapologetic choices she made in life. Among them was her deeply emotional and controversial relationship with actor Raj Babbar. It was a love that bloomed amid chaos, endured public backlash, and eventually left behind an aching legacy. Their first meeting was on the sets of 'Bheegi Palkein'. Raj Babbar, already married to theatre actor Nadira Babbar, was taken in by Smita's remarkable intensity and free-spirited nature. Despite their initial differences, something inexplicable drew them together. Smita, known for her humility despite being a critically acclaimed actress, often sought Raj\u2019s advice. The professional camaraderie gradually turned into a deep emotional bond. In an interview with Hindustan Times, Raj once said, \u201cMy relationship with Smita was not the result of problems with Nadira\u2014it just happened.\u201d On December 10, 1981, Raj Babbar and Smita Patil were married in a quiet ceremony. At the time, Raj was still legally married to Nadira, making Smita his second wife under Hindu personal law. For a woman who had worked closely with feminist movements, Smita\u2019s decision to marry a married man shocked many. The backlash was intense\u2014not just from the media and film fraternity, but also from the very circles she once championed. Yet, Smita remained steadfast, guided by what she believed to be love in its rawest form.Born to social reformer Vidyatai Patil and politician Shivajirao Girdhar Patil, Smita was raised with strong values. She was discovered by Shyam Benegal while working as a newsreader on Doordarshan and went on to redefine Indian cinema through films like 'Bhumika', 'Arth', 'Mandi', and 'Jait Re Jait'. Whether in offbeat or mainstream cinema, she brought truth to every character she played. Their relationship, though deeply emotional, was far from easy. In a rare and revealing interview, the late actress once confessed, \u201cIn the kind of situation we are involved in, both of us are going through a private hell. It\u2019s very easy to say \u2018it\u2019s okay\u2019. But it\u2019s not very easy in reality.\u201dShe acknowledged the pain Nadira must have felt, but also clung to her own reality\u2014the fierce desire to love and to be loved. In a heartbreakingly human moment, Smita described her life with Raj as a \u201cpainful trip,\u201d marred by insecurity and loneliness. Despite everything, Smita longed for motherhood. That wish came true when she gave birth to their son, Prateik, in November 1986. But joy was short-lived. Just a few days after childbirth, complications set in. Smita Patil, the woman who had portrayed strength and struggle on screen so effortlessly, succumbed to post-partum complications on December 13, 1986, leaving her newborn behind. She was only 31.Smita\u2019s death was not just the loss of an artist\u2014it was a gut-wrenching blow to those who loved her. Raj Babbar, broken by grief, returned to Nadira, while Prateik was raised by Smita\u2019s parents. Nadira Babbar\u2019s response to it all was perhaps one of the most poignant aspects of this story. Despite being hurt and publicly judged, she never wavered in her composure. She accepted Raj back not out of weakness, but out of a quiet strength and a desire to protect her children from emotional damage.She even attended Smita\u2019s funeral with her children, Juhi and Arya. Years later, she would recall the pain of that day, and the sorrow she felt not just for her own loss, but for Smita\u2019s unfulfilled dreams. \u201cThe grief of her passing away became larger than any other sorrow. It broke us all\u2014Raj, Prateik, her parents and somewhere, me too,\u201d she admitted as reported on Bollywoodshaadis. Raj Babbar, when asked about Smita, still speaks with emotion. He never denies the storm they lived through. But he also never downplays what she meant to him. \u201cEvery little thing she said or did, and how she looked at me when she first met me... her whole life comes alive in front of my eyes,\u201d he once said to Reddif.com.\"Thoughout the journey from home to hospital, she kept apologising and I told her that everything would be okay. She looked at me with tears in her eyes. Her look said it all. The doctor came out after an hour and said she had gone into a coma. I was part of her and she was part of me. It is natural that you miss a person who was your heart and soul throughout your life, no matter how brave you may say you are. She and her memories will continue to be part of me till my last day,\" he added.Smita Patil\u2019s story isn\u2019t one of fairytale romance or tidy endings. It\u2019s the story of a woman who loved fiercely, fully aware of the price she might pay. She embraced contradictions, defied convention, and lived\u2014and died\u2014by her own rules. Her legacy endures, not just through the powerful roles she portrayed, but in the memory of a love that refused to conform to society\u2019s expectations.Years after Smita's demise, her professional rivalry Shabana Azmi is set to work with her son Prateik Babbar in a film titled, 'Imaginary Rain', directed by chef-author Vikas Khanna. Based on Khanna\u2019s novel, the film follows a masterchef in Manhattan (played by Azmi) who returns to India after a personal tragedy. The collaboration holds emotional depth, as Azmi was once a professional rival of Prateik\u2019s late mother, Smita Patil. Azmi described working with Prateik as \u201cdestiny\u201d and noted his striking resemblance to Smita. Prateik recently revealed Azmi and Javed Akhtar had once considered adopting him, adding poignancy to their onscreen bond. The film explores identity, legacy, and generational connections."

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) workers on Wednesday staged a protest at the footover bridge near Modi Flour Mills in Okhla, days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s hard-hitting address to the nation that ruled out any talks with Pakistan apart from terrorism and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK).

In his address, PM Modi declared, \u201cIf there will be talks between India and Pakistan, it will only be on terrorism and PoK,\u201d firmly dismissing any prospects of normal diplomatic engagement with Islamabad.The Prime Minister lauded India\u2019s armed forces, intelligence agencies, and scientists, saying the success of Operation Sindoor was a \u201cpledge fulfilled\u201d on behalf of millions of Indians. He added that the nation had witnessed both \u201cIndia\u2019s strength and restraint\u201d in recent days.Reiterating India\u2019s toughened stance, the PM said, \u201cTerror and trade cannot go hand in hand, nor can blood and water flow together.\u201d He warned Pakistan that continued support for terrorism would lead to its downfall: \u201cPakistan\u2019s military and government have nurtured terrorism. If Pakistan wants to survive, it must dismantle its terror infrastructure. There is no other path to peace.\u201dAAP leader Manish Sisodia questions Narendra Modi over \u2018sudden ceasefire\u2019Former Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday questioned the government's decision to agree to a \"sudden ceasefire\" despite what he described as a clear strategic advantage and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address the doubts being raised around it. Sisodia also asked why Modi didn\u2019t press for a formal written peace accord, similar to the Shimla Agreement signed in 1972. \u201cWhen the entire nation and the opposition were standing with the govt, and the Indian Army was in a strong position, why did Modi suddenly agree to a ceasefire?\u201d he asked. Referring to PM Modi\u2019s own remarks about Pakistan being a terrorist state, Sisodia questioned the logic behind not pressing for stronger terms. \u201cModi admitted that Pakistan is a terrorist state. If Pakistan was unable to counter our airstrikes and was begging to end the tension, why did he not demand that the terrorists responsible for the Pahalgam attack be handed over to India?\u201d Sisodia said."

The Israeli military confirmed the strike, asserting it targeted a Hamas command centre beneath the hospital, though this claim remains unverified. An Israeli air strike on the European Hospital in Gaza's Khan Younis has killed over 40 people and injured dozens more, according to officials from the Hamas-run civil defence agency.At least 22 children were killed and 48 others reportedly lost their lives, according to the Indonesian Hospital in Jabaliya. The strikes occurred a day after Hamas released an Israeli-American hostage in a deal brokered by the United States, coinciding with a visit by US President Donald Trump to Saudi Arabia.Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu announced there was \u201cno way\u201d Israel would halt its war in Gaza, dampening hopes for a ceasefire.The Israeli military refused to comment on the strikes but had earlier warned residents of Jabaliya to evacuate late Tuesday night, citing the presence of Hamas infrastructure in the area, including rocket launchers.Netanyahu's office said Israeli forces were just days away from a promised escalation of force and would enter Gaza \u201cwith great strength to complete the mission. ... It means destroying Hamas.\u201dLocal sources quoted by BBC say that six bombs were dropped simultaneously by Israeli warplanes, striking both the inner courtyard of the hospital and its surrounding areas. The attack left several deep craters across the hospital compound, burying vehicles, including part of a large bus, under rubble. The injured are receiving treatment and are reported to be in a stable condition.The strike was confirmed by the Israeli military, calling it a \u201cprecise\u201d operation targeting a Hamas command and control centre located beneath the hospital. It said the strike was aimed at Hamas militants, although the claim has not been independently verified.Eyewitnesses reported Israeli drones hovering over the hospital after the strike, making it nearly impossible for rescue teams to access the area. Civil defence officers were reportedly wounded by a quadcopter drone as they tried to reach the site.Israeli media have suggested the strike may have been targeting Mohammed Sinwar, a senior Hamas figure and younger brother of Yahya Sinwar, the former Hamas leader in Gaza. Mohammed Sinwar is believed to have taken control of Hamas\u2019s military operations after the death of Mohammed Deif in an Israeli attack last year. Hamas has not responded to the reports.On Tuesday evening, the Israeli army said it intercepted two projectiles fired from Gaza. The armed wing of Islamic Jihad later claimed responsibility, claiming that it had launched rocket fire towards Israel."

The aging sun will cause water evaporation and temperature rise. This will disrupt the carbon cycle and kill vegetation. Earth's atmosphere will then resemble its early state, rich in methane. Complex life will struggle to survive this deoxygenation event. A groundbreaking study led by researchers from Toho University, using NASA's planetary modeling, has predicted a dramatic shift in Earth's atmosphere that could render life as we know it impossible. According to the research, Earth's oxygen will disappear in approximately one billion years. This prediction, published in the scientific journal Nature Geoscience, marks a significant development in understanding the planet's atmospheric evolution. The study ran 400,000 simulations to explore how Earth\u2019s atmosphere might evolve as the sun continues to age and intensify. While this drastic transformation may be far in the future, understanding the mechanisms behind it offers essential insights into planetary science and the future of Earth's biosphere. The study titled \"The Future Lifespan of Earth's Oxygenated Atmosphere\" outlines a future where oxygen becomes scarce due to natural planetary changes. Led by Kazumi Ozaki, an assistant professor at Toho University in Tokyo, Japan, the researchers examined the factors contributing to atmospheric changes over geological timescales.The role of the Sun Earlier scientific models suggested that Earth's biosphere would last up to two billion years, primarily due to overheating and the eventual depletion of CO\u2082 necessary for photosynthesis. However, this new research narrows the timeframe, suggesting a much earlier end to oxygen production.Kazumi Ozaki emphasized that while the eventual demise of Earth's biosphere was acknowledged, pinpointing the timing and the precise process of deoxygenation remained elusive. This study, using advanced supercomputer simulations, provides a clearer understanding by simulating numerous potential scenarios. Understanding the lifespan of Earth's oxygenated atmosphere has profound implications for both planetary science and astrobiology. Researchers now aim to investigate how similar processes might occur on exoplanets, particularly those orbiting older stars, to gauge their habitability.Key research questions moving forward"

NEW DELHI: With a blindfold covering his eyes and his head tilted slightly to the right, BSF jawan Purnam Kumar Shaw appeared tense and disoriented \u2014 like a man caught in uncertainty, thousands of miles from home.The image, released by the Pakistan Rangers while he was in their custody, offered a chilling glimpse into the fate of the soldier who had inadvertently crossed the border on April 23 \u2014 a day after the deadly Pahalgam attack that sharply escalated tensions between India and Pakistan.Back home, his wife \u2014 pregnant with their second child \u2014 endured anxious days and sleepless nights.

Each passing day brought the same haunting question: would she ever see her husband return?The image, which surfaced later, marked the beginning of his nearly three-week detention in Pakistan. Shaw, posted with the 182 Battalion in the Ferozepur sector of Punjab, was caught after straying across the border. His repatriation was delayed due to heightened hostilities following the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that claimed 26 lives. With tensions escalating, Pakistan suspended all flag meetings along the border, stalling diplomatic channels. His wife, Rajani Shaw, travelled from West Bengal to Punjab in the days that followed, seeking help from BSF officials and urging the Centre to intervene. Appeals were also made by political representatives from his constituency in Serampore. After weeks of uncertainty, Shaw was handed back to India on May 14 at the Attari-Wagah Joint Check Post in Amritsar. The official handover took place around 10.30am and followed established cross-border protocols. Sources said that under normal circumstances, such repatriations are completed within 24 to 48 hours. Once back, Shaw was taken for medical examination and debriefing. BSF officials confirmed he was in stable health.

Jairam Ramesh questioned whether India's security interests were compromised under US pressure, referencing Trump's remarks in Saudi Arabia. NEW DELHI: The Congress on Wednesday took a swipe at the Central government and asked what the \"typically loquacious\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi and external affairs minister S Jaishankar have to speak about the US President Donald Trump's repeated assertions about mediating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. Trump, while in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, reiterated his claim about his administration's role in brokering a historic ceasefire.Jairam Ramesh, Congress general secretary for communications, questioned the Centre whether they have mortgaged India\u2019s security interests in the face of US pressure. \"A few days ago we learnt of the ceasefire with Pakistan from the President of the United States. Now, at a public event in Saudi Arabia yesterday, the President reveals that he may have coerced and blackmailed India into this ceasefire using the carrot-and-stick of sanctions and trade deals. What do the typically loquacious PM and EAM have to say about this revelation? Did they mortgage India\u2019s security interests in the face of US pressure?\" he said in a post on X. Taking a swipe at Centre, Jairam Ramesh, in reference with the BJP's campaign ad of a girl saying \"PM Modi ne war rukwa di papa (Russia-Ukraine),\" said, \"Ameriki papa ne war rukwa di kya? (American father has stopped the war)\" Earlier today, Congress leader Sachin Pilot raised the question on Trump's reiterated claims of mediating cesefire between the two countries. He asked what kind of assurances did the Centre gave for ceasefire. Sachin Pilot said, \"Trump's repeated statements have still not been clearly and precisely questioned at a high level. No matter how many times Trump has raised this issue on social media, he has not used the word terrorist or terrorism even once. He did not speak one word on Pakistan's involvement, which has a proven track record, in the Mumbai, Pulwama, or Pahalgam attacks... But surprisingly, he highlighted the Kashmir issue for no reason. Pakistan wants to internationalise the Kashmir issue... It is time to call a special session (of the Parliament) and pass the 1994 proposal of taking PoK back... The US President announcing the ceasefire was unexpected... Pakistan is a failed state controlled by its Army and ISI. So what assurances did they give for a ceasefire...?\"The Congress party highlighted on Tuesday evening that Trump was equating the two nations and drawing parallels between Prime Minister Modi and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Pawan Khera, head of Congress' media department, shared Trump's recent Saudi Arabia speech, questioning if such comparisons were acceptable to the PMO.At the Saudi-US investment forum in Riyadh, Trump stated his desire for peace, mentioning his administration's role in halting escalating tensions between India and Pakistan. He suggested using trade as leverage, addressing the audience, which included Elon Musk.Previously, Trump claimed to have prevented a nuclear conflict between the South Asian neighbours by offering trade incentives. However, Indian government sources maintain that the understanding reached on May 10 was directly between the countries' military operations directors general, without third-party involvement.India consistently maintains that Kashmir is a bilateral matter, rejecting third-party mediation. The country firmly states that Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are integral parts of India.

They are mostly bought for saving tax, not financial protection.With no deduction available under the new regime, policyholders will not find them very useful. However, closing a policy prematurely has financial implications.Total loss for new purchases: Did you buy life insurance in the past two years? If a life insurance policy has not completed three years, all the premiums paid will be forfeited if the policy is prematurely closed. To many people, this may appear a losing proposition. Financial planners say losing 1-2 years\u2019 premium is better than continuing a policy that will yield a return of barely 5-6% for the next 10-15 years. They say it is better to take that loss and invest the future premiums in more lucrative avenues. But there is another aspect that taxpayers must keep in mind when ending a policy prematurely. If you have claimed tax benefits under Section 80C, premature closure before three years could lead to a retrospective tax liability. The taxman will want you to pay up the tax you saved when you purchased the policy.50-70% hit for older policies: After you pay premiums for three years, an insurance policy acquires a surrender value. This surrender value is not very high. If a policy with an annual premium of Rs 20,000 per year is surrendered after the third year, the policyholder can expect to get back around Rs 18,000 (or 30% of the Rs 60,000 paid over three years). The surrender value increases with every passing year. It may be close to 40-50% if premiums have been paid for 10-12 years.Different rules for Ulips: The rules are different for Ulips. These plans have a mandatory 5-year lock-in period, but premature closure is not as painful as in case of traditional policies. If you stop paying the premium of a Ulip, the policy will terminate but the money you paid till then is not forfeited. The balance in the Ulip is moved to a discontinuance fund where it earns a minimal 4% per year and is returned to you after the five-year lock-in ends.Experts advise that if the policy is going to mature in 3-4 years, it is better to continue paying the premium and reap the full benefits promised under the plan. If the policyholder is finding it difficult to pay the premiums, it is best to turn the policy into a paid-up plan. You stop paying the premium but the policy continues to be in force, although the sum assured (the death benefit or maturity amount) are proportionally reduced.The reduced sum assured is better than surrendering the policy completely."

The image is used for representative purposes only. | Photo Credit: KUMAR SS Following a series of incidents involving children accidentally locking themselves inside unattended parked vehicles, the Cyberabad Police have issued a public safety advisory urging citizens to adopt strict precautions to prevent further tragedies. This comes a day after a five-year-old girl died after accidentally locking herself inside a parked car while playing in Makthamadaram village in Kadthal. A month earlier, on April 14, two children died of suffocation after they were found trapped inside a parked car in Damaragidda village of Chevella. The police said that every vehicle be thoroughly checked before it is locked\u2014this includes inspecting both the front and rear seats for children or pets. Police also warned against ever leaving children alone inside or even near a parked vehicle, even briefly. One of the key safety lapses identified is the accessibility of car keys or remote locking devices to children. If within reach, children may accidentally unlock and enter vehicles, becoming trapped without the ability to get out. Police recommend that keys be stored securely and out of children\u2019s sight and reach. The advisory further calls on parents to educate their children about the dangers of vehicles, making it clear that cars are not places to play. Other precautions recommended include locking vehicles even when parked at home, avoiding the use of dark window tints that obstruct visibility, and installing modern safety features such as rear seat reminders or child detection alerts\u2014technologies designed to prevent such oversights. \u201cDoors and windows must be completely shut and secured, even when the vehicle is not in use,\u201d the police added. \u201cIn cases where children go missing, the first step should be to check inside nearby vehicles.\u201d As temperatures soar during the summer, the interior of a parked car can become a death trap within minutes. The police stressed that children playing outdoors near parked vehicles are especially vulnerable during this time, and adults must take immediate precautions. This advisory serves as a stark reminder that simple preventive steps can make the difference between life and death."

The micro rockets used in this counter-drone system underwent rigorous testing at the Seaward Firing Range, Gopalpur achieving all designated objectives. Three trials were conducted for the rocket at Gopalpur on May 13 in presence of senior officials of Army Air Defence (AAD). #WATCH | A new low-cost Counter Drone System in Hard Kill mode 'Bhargavastra', has been designed and developed by Solar Defence and Aerospace Limited (SDAL), signifying a substantial leap in countering the escalating threat of drone swarms. The micro rockets used in this\u2026 pic.twitter.com/qM4FWtEF43 Two trials were conducted by firing one rocket each. One trial was conducted by firing two rockets in salvo mode within 2 seconds. All four rockets performed as expected and achieved the required launch parameters underscoring its pioneering technology in mitigating large-scale drone attacks. A Unified Solution for Countering Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Threats: \u2018Bhargavastra\u2019 boasts of advanced capabilities for detecting and eliminating small, incoming drones at distances of upto 2.5 km. It employs unguided micro rockets as the first layer of defence capable of neutralising swarm of drones with lethal radius of 20 meters and guided micro-missile (already tested earlier) as the second layer for pinpoint accuracy, ensuring precise and impactful neutralisation. Designed for seamless deployment across diverse terrains, including high-altitude regions (> 5000 m above sea level), the system addresses the unique operational demands of India's armed forces. Highlighting Bhargavastra\u2019s adaptability and cost-effectiveness, SDAL emphasised its indigenous design and the development of dedicated rocket and micro-missiles to neutralise hostile UAVs. Furthermore, the system is modular and can have an additional soft-kill layer to include Jamming and Spoofing to provide an integrated and comprehensive shield for all branches of the armed forces. The system being modular the sensors (Radar, EO & RF Receiver) and shooter can be configured as per user requirement and made to work in an integrated manner for layered and tiered AD cover, enabling engagement of targets at longer ranges. \u2018Bhargavastra\u2019 provides a comprehensive situational awareness overview, enabling operators to evaluate and counter individual drones or entire swarms. According to its developers, the system represents a significant stride in counter-drone technology. Its open-source architecture suggests that while several advanced nations are developing similar micro-missile systems, a domestically conceived multi-layered and cost-effective counter-drone system with swarm neutralisation capabilities like \u2018Bhargavastra\u2019 is yet to be deployed anywhere else globally."

Speculation about the NCP led by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and NCP (SP) led by his uncle Sharad Pawar gained traction after the latter reportedly said it was up to NCP (SP) working President Supriya Sule and Ajit to decide about the reunion. \"The rumoured merger has never taken shape. It has always remained a matter of speculation. It's only a talking point, nothing has materialised,\" Mr. Patil told reporters. He said the undivided NCP was essentially a party dominated by three individuals- Sharad Pawar, his daughter Sule, and nephew Ajit Pawar. \"Even then, the current state NCP (SP) president Jayant Patil and the party MLA Rohit Pawar (grandnephew of Sharad Pawar) were kept at a distance. They are merely watching the developments, while these three individuals called the shots,\" he added. The NCP, founded by Sharad Pawar in 1999, split in July 2023 when Ajit Pawar, then the Leader of the Opposition, joined the ruling Mahayuti alliance, then led by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, taking several MLAs with him. Ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Ajit Pawar secured the official party name and election symbol, while Sharad Pawar had to register his faction as NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar), with a new symbol."

Forest Minister Arun Kumar Saxena said surveillance has been intensified not just in zoos, but also in poultry farms across the state. The zoo shutdown \u2014 effective from May 14 to May 20 \u2014 was ordered by Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) Anuradha Vemuri, in line with directives issued during a high-level meeting chaired by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday. The decision aims to prevent any possible transmission of the virus and to enhance surveillance across zoos and poultry farms. Chief Minister Adityanath stressed the need for urgent and coordinated action across departments. \"The safety of animals and birds in zoos, bird sanctuaries, wetlands, cow shelters and national parks must be the topmost priority. All officials must act promptly and as per the guidelines of the Central and State governments,\" he said. All animals across the facilities are being monitored closely for symptoms and enhanced sanitation and infection control protocols have been put in place. Forest Minister Arun Kumar Saxena confirmed that bird flu was detected in the tigress that died in Gorakhpur. \"Lab reports have confirmed bird flu in the tigress. As a result, surveillance has been intensified not just in zoos, but also in poultry farms across the state. Staff have been directed to follow strict biosecurity measures,\" Mr. Saxena said. Meanwhile, Lucknow Zoo Director Aditi Singh said that while no case of bird flu has been reported at the capital's zoo, the facility has been closed as a preventive measure. \"All animals are under close observation. A decision on reopening will be taken after reviewing the situation at the end of the week,\" she said. Bird flu, or avian influenza, is a contagious viral disease that primarily affects birds, but in rare instances, can spread to mammals and even humans if the virus mutates. It is generally transmitted through contact with infected birds or contaminated surfaces. While human infections are uncommon, they can be serious. Health officials have advised citizens to report any dead or sick birds to authorities and maintain hygiene while handling pet or domestic birds."

ReNew was the largest RE investor in Andhra Pradesh six years ago, that is, in 2019 with an installed capacity of 777 MW but it had suspended its expansion plans owing to the cancellation of Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) by the YSR Congress Party government. India's ReNew Energy offered to be taken private in $2.82 billion deal The company\u2019s re-entry into Andhra Pradesh now reflects the investor confidence in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, and the above project is the first major one being grounded after the State\u2019s Integrated Clean Energy Policy (ICEP) came into force in October 2024. The breakthrough came after Mr. Lokesh\u2019s meeting with ReNew chairman Sumant Sinha on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum held at Davos (Switzerland). The project at Bethapalle, which is situated in Guntakal Assembly constituency, would have 587 MW solar and 250 MW wind capacities in addition to a 415 MWh Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) in Phase-I, whose total cost is pegged at \u20b97,000 crore. India adds record renewable energy capacity of about 30 GW in 2024 The cumulative capacity in all phases would be 1,800 MW peak of solar, 1 GW wind and 2,000 MWh BESS with an aggregate investment of \u20b922,000 crore.

Animals and birds make away with a lot of the produce at his 40-acre organic farm that borders Dindigul district.

But he is keeping his chin up, packing off mangoes to customers across India. \u201cMangoes are extremely sensitive to rains,\u201d he says, as we make our way through prickly undergrowth towards a tree laden with Alphonso mangoes. \u201cIf there is too much rain, the fruit might not hold much sugar content.\u201d The Alphonsos are a mix of dark and light green, with a few showing smudges of orange. The smell \u2014 a heady combination of earth and rain with sweetish undertones \u2014 is an indicator that the fruits are ready to be harvested. Climate change and unseasonal rains have affected produce | Photo Credit: PERIASAMY M According to the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University\u2019s Agritech Portal, India ranks first in the world among mango producing countries. In Tamil Nadu, major mango growing districts are Dindigul, Theni, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Vellore, and Thiruvallur. Salem, known for its Gundu variety, is yet another mango hub. Farmers report that the season has been in its peak over the past 15 days in the region. Mango farmer K Baskar, who is based in Coimbatore, at his 40-acre organic farm in Andipatti in Tiruppur district | Photo Credit: PERIASAMY M According to Sathish Ramasamy, who owns 35 acres in Magudanchavadi, Salem, they initially faced issues with quality. Right now though, their fruits are in great form. Sathish, who runs the company Salemmango, sells online and has customers across India. \u201cI do not use chemicals since our farm is located in a rain-fed area,\u201d he says, adding that mango farmers from near and far visit his farm to understand how it is possible to grow mangoes organically. Friends and software professionals Shyam Sembagoundar and Siva Sankar, who hail from Salem and work in the US, help Salem mango farmers find customers through their online venture Namkalam. \u201cWe route customers directly to farmers,\u201d explains Shyam. He adds that farmers who they work with drop off produce at the Salem market. The two of them then package the fruits to ship to people across Tamil Nadu, and offer a holistic approach to customer service complete with a refund if there are issues. The idea, Shyam explains, is to help farmers sell their produce for a good price. While mango trees are known to be hardy, climate change is making things difficult for farmers by springing up unseasonal rains. Those following organic methods find it even more challenging. But they are dealing with the problem with techniques such as biological sprays. Ajay Kuruvila, a farmer based in Dindigul, curates mangoes from organic farmers from the district, supplying to organic stores in Chennai, Coimbatore, and Madurai. Ajay explains that once the mangoes are harvested with their stalks intact, they are set upside down to let the sap flow, washed in alum, and then packed. \u201cThis is so that the fruit does not develop black blemishes once it ripens,\u201d he says. Apart from Sappattai, Malgova, and Imam Pasand, farmers in the region are also harvesting Karunkurangu, a large, sweet variety, according to Ajay. \u201cIn two weeks, Mallika and Neelam will start arriving, followed by Kasalattu towards the end of the season in June,\u201d he says. This spacing-out of varieties is Nature\u2019s way of letting us try a little bit of everything. However, climate change is shaking up this cycle as well. In Rajapalayam district, known for Sappattai, KS Jaganatha Raja, who owns 12 acres by the foothills of the Western Ghats, says that fruits have been rendered with black spots due to rains. \u201cThis has affected their pricing at the market,\u201d says Jaganatha. He says that some people do resort to spraying ethylene gas to ripen fruits since they are harvested ahead of time fearing rains and winds, but they do not do so. Jaganatha has revived several rare varieties of mangoes at his farm, selling saplings that he propagates through the grafting technique at his nursery. Among such varieties is Mohandas, of which he has just one tree in his orchard. Jaganatha grew excited when the lone tree bore over 2,500 fruits last year. \u201cI went to see it every day, thinking I will pluck the mangoes once they are mature enough,\u201d recalls the 69-year-old. But then one night, most of them were gone."

Jaishankar have to say about this revelation and did they \"mortgage\" India's security interests in the face of U.S. \"pressure.\" Speaking in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday (May 13, 2025), Mr. Trump once again claimed his administration \"successfully brokered a historic ceasefire\" to stop the escalating violence between India and Pakistan. Congress general secretary in-charge of Communications Jairam Ramesh, said, \u201cA few days ago, we learnt of the ceasefire with Pakistan from the President of the United States. Now, at a public event in Saudi Arabia yesterday, the President reveals that he may have coerced and blackmailed India into this ceasefire using the carrot-and-stick of sanctions and trade deals.\u201d A few days ago we learnt of the ceasefire with Pakistan from the President of the United States.

He stopped the war) the Congress on Tuesday (May 13, 2025) night had said Mr. Trump was not only hyphenating the two countries but also comparing Prime Minister Modi with his Pakistani counterpart Shehbaz Sharif. The Congress' media and publicity department head Pawan Khera shared the clip of Mr. Trump's latest comments during the event in Saudi Arabia. \"U.S. President says it again: 'I used trade to make a deal between them, and they agreed.' Not only is Donald Trump hyphenating India with Pakistan, he is comparing Prime Minister Modi with Shehbaz Sharif,\" he said in the caption. He asked if such a comparison was acceptable to the Prime Ministers Office (PMO). \"Just days ago, my administration successfully brokered a historic ceasefire to stop the escalating violence between India and Pakistan,\" claimed Mr. Trump, who is in Saudi Arabia on the first leg of his four-day trip to the Gulf region. A day earlier, Mr. Trump had claimed that his administration stopped a \"nuclear conflict\" between India and Pakistan, telling the south Asian neighbours that America would do a \"lot of trade\" with them if they ended hostilities. India and Pakistan reached an understanding on May 10 to end the conflict after four days of intense cross-border drone and missile strikes. Indian government sources in New Delhi have maintained the Directors General of Military Operations (DGMOs) of India and Pakistan reached an understanding to stop all firings and military actions on land, air and sea and that no third party was involved. Mr. Trump had announced India and Pakistan agreed to a \"full and immediate ceasefire\" and claimed that it happened after a long night of talks \"mediated by the United States.\" India maintains the Kashmir issue to be a bilateral matter and that there is no space for any third party."

A Bench of Justices M.M.

            "text": "The top court questioned the Centre for earmarking fewer posts for women despite claiming the posts to be gender neutral. | Photo Credit: Reuters If a woman can fly Rafale fighter jet in the Indian Air Force, then why are fewer women officers in gender neutral posts of Judge Advocate General (legal) branch of the Army, the Supreme Court wondered recently and questioned the Centre's rationale on a 50-50 selection criterion. A bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Manmohan on May 8 reserved its verdict on the plea of two officers Arshnoor Kaur and Astha Tyagi, who despite securing 4th and 5th ranks respectively \u2014 higher in merit than their male counterparts \u2014 weren't selected for the JAG department due to fewer vacancies earmarked for women. The officers challenged the disproportionate vacancies for men and women and said they could not be selected as there were only three vacancies for women out of the total six posts. The bench referred to a newspaper article that a woman fighter pilot would be flying Rafale aircraft and said in such a scenario she could be taken as a prisoner of war. \"If it's permissible in the Indian Air Force for a lady to fly a Rafale fighter jet, then why is it so difficult for the Army to allow more women in JAG?\" Justice Datta asked Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, who was appearing for the Centre and the Army. Ms. Bhati submitted the induction and employment of women officers in the Army including JAG branch was a progressive process keeping in view its operational preparedness. \"To say the policy of intake of men and women officers from 2012 to 2023 in the ratio of 70:30 (or now being 50:50) as discriminatory and volatile of fundamental rights would not only be incorrect but will also transgress into domain of executive which is the only competent and sole authority for deciding the intake of men and women officers in Indian Army,\" she said. Justice Manmohan observed if 10 women qualified for JAG on the basis of merit whether all of them would be appointed as officers JAG branch. Ms. Bhati defended the Centre\u2019s decision and said the gender-specific vacancies were present in all branches of the Army based on the manpower assessment and requirement. \"Functioning of JAG branch cannot be seen in isolation as mere legal advisors to military commanders during peacetime. It's an integral part of the Indian Army also having an equally important role in its operational preparedness,\" she said. Conducting separate SSBs for men and women are a necessity due to the nature of tests involved, which require close intensive physical interactions, Bhati added. Previously, when the top court asked why were JAG women officers not deployed in combat zones merely due to threat perception, Bhati called it a \"conscious decision\" on part of the government of India to restrict the employment of women officers from being posted in frontline combat deployment made them susceptible to enemy contact. judiciary (system of justice) / armed Forces / gender"

Commuters had a tough time navigating inundated and water-logged roads, not only on May 13 evening, but also the next morning with office-going traffic out of gear in many stretches on May 14. For instance, the railway underbridge at Hoodi, an important link, was flooded on May 14 morning as well, said K. R. Puram traffic police on social media platform X. Several trees and branches that had fallen on May 13 night had not been cleared, disrupting traffic in many areas. Significant water-logging was observed on the Nagavara-Hebbal flyover stretch on Outer Ring Road, Hebbal-Jakkur stretch, Hunasamaranahalli on Ballari Road, Hoodi railway underpass, Electronics City flyover, among other places. \u201cFrom Mehkri Circle till Jakkur, the road was heavily waterlogged. As there was water-logging on the Hebbal flyover, traffic moved at a snail\u2019s pace. Many were stuck on the road on two-wheelers. While even in peak traffic hours, it usually takes 15-20 mins to cross Hebbal, it took over 35 mins on May 13 night even after 10.30 pm,\u201d said R. Saroja, a resident of Yelahanka. For instance, the Veerannapalya stretch between Nagavara and Hebbal, inundation on Hebbal and Electronics City flyovers were an issue that had come to the fore during the 2024 monsoon as well. A senior traffic official said that they had observed significant water-logging at 33 locations on May 13 evening, and had reported the same to Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). \u201cMany of these stretches have been seeing inundation and water-logging almost with every spell of rain. We have repeatedly flagged these spots to the civic body,\u201d he said. Likewise, despite multiple special drives and calling upon members of the public to report aging and dangerous trees to be removed and pruned, nearly 40 trees and over 125 branches fell on May 13 evening alone. Recently, an autorickshaw driver was killed after a tree fell on the vehicle. \u201cThe wind speed in the city on May 13 was high. More than the rain, trees have fallen due to wind. Not just old and brittle trees, even many healthy green trees have fallen,\u201d said B. L. G. Swamy, Deputy Conservator of Forests, BBMP, adding all of them would be cleared by May 14 evening. Tree conservation activist Vijay Nishanth said that most of the tree falls could be attributed to choking of their roots by concrete. \u201cA majority of the trees falling are brittle trees like copper pods. We need to take along ward committees to monitor trees in their areas, and maintain them through pruning and other activities. If we choke their roots, the trees will be more susceptible to falling. We need to address that in the city,\u201d he said.

The organisation urged the government to impose economic sanctions on the country for its \u2018unholy alliance\u2019 with Pakistan and also suggested ban on flights and tourism. SJM also appealed to the people of India to boycott nations actively helping Pakistan build its offensive capabilities and urged the citizens to boycott Turkish products, travel, and cultural exports as a mark of solidarity with the soldiers and national interest. The SJM\u2019s appeal came amid tensions between India and Pakistan following their recent military confrontation after the Pahalgam terror attack in which 26 people were killed. The conflict saw Pakistan unleash swarms of Turkish drones to target Indian military facilities. Expressing shock over Turkiye, a NATO member, supplying arms to Pakistan, Mr. Mahajan said that the country has increasingly aligned itself with radical Islamist regimes and military establishments hostile to India\u2019s sovereignty. \u201cIt is shocking to note that Turkiye, the second-largest arms supplier to Pakistan after China, has played a key role in modernizing Pakistan\u2019s navy and enhancing its aerial warfare capabilities,\u201d he added. Terming the defence collaboration between Turkiye and Pakistan as an \u201cunholy alliance\u201d that directly compromises India\u2019s national security, the SJM added that the same is not just commercial but ideological, which is targeting the stability of South Asia and emboldening Pakistan\u2019s military adventurism. \u201cAt a time when Bharat has exercised tremendous restraint in the face of repeated provocations from Pakistan \u2014 including the harbouring of terror camps and aggressive posturing near the Line of Control \u2014 Turkiye\u2019s support amounts to direct complicity. It\u2019s unfortunate that Turkiye didn\u2019t even condemn the brutal terror attack at Pahalgam killing 26 people on April 22,\u201d the SJM official stated. He also call out Turkiye for forgetting India\u2019s generous and timely humanitarian assistances at time of its worst crisis including the earthquakes that shook the country in February 2023. he also mentioned how, on multilateral platforms like the G20 and U.N., India has consistently supported inclusive engagement with Turkiye as part of the broader West Asian neighbourhood, including dialogue on energy security and counter-terrorism. \u201cDespite these gestures of solidarity and goodwill, Turkiye has chosen to side with Bharat\u2019s adversaries in matters of vital national security interest. This betrayal of trust must be addressed with moral clarity and strategic firmness,\u201d he added."

The upcoming plant, to be installed by Chennai MSW Pvt Ltd over 8.2 hectares, is expected to process 1,800 tonnes per day of municipal waste and generate eight megawatts of electricity by October 2025. However, residents from nearby Baiganwadi and Shivaji Nagar fear it will emit toxic gases, aggravating respiratory diseases in an already vulnerable population. Citizens\u2019 group Govandi New Sangam Welfare Society filed a High Court petition in October 2022, demanding the facility\u2019s closure. In response, MPCB officer Rakesh Dafade stated the WtE project was evaluated for over a year, and measures like scrubbers, a 50-meter chimney, and leachate treatment systems are planned to curb pollution. However, for residents, the core concern remains unaddressed\u2014 waste segregation. \u201cDeonar\u2019s waste is a toxic mix of wet, dry, plastic, and even biomedical material. Without proper segregation, how can this project work without causing harm?\u201d asked Mr. Aditya. Residents are demanding a stay on the project until a thorough Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and medical and environmental studies in Govandi are conducted. An RTI has also been filed to access clearance documentation and environmental reports related to the project."

Besides, the carrier is having a technical stop in Kolkata for some of the North America flights from Delhi, they added. India closes its airspace to airlines from Pakistan The Tata Group-owned airline has been exploring alternatives for the services from the national capital to North America in order to reduce the flying time as well as operational expenses. At present, Air India operates 71 flights a week to North American destinations. Of them, 54 services are from the national capital. The airline flies to Chicago, New York, Washington, San Francisco, and Newark in the U.S., and to Toronto and Vancouver in Canada. Mostly, the Mongolian airspace is used by some of Air India's flights from San Francisco and Vancouver. The flights from Delhi to these two cities are mostly using the Pacific route, according to the sources. The flights AI186 from Vancouver to Delhi and AI174 from San Francisco to Delhi have been using the Mongolian airspace for the past few days, as per information from flight tracking website Flightradar24.com. For some of the flights connecting North America cities and Delhi, the utilisation of the Mongolian airspace and a technical stop at Kolkata are among the alternatives that have been chosen by Air India, the sources said. With such an arrangement in place, the airline does not have to make a stop in a European city while operating certain long haul and ultra long haul flights from Delhi to North America. Air India MD and CEO Campbell Wilson, in a message to staff on May 2, said there had been a number of network-related developments and the airline had temporarily adjusted some of its Europe and U.S. routes in response to recent airspace restrictions, as well as added a few technical stops. On May 2, sources said the airline was looking at various alternatives for its North America flights from the national capital, including operating the services with a technical stop in a city within India. In the wake of retaliatory measures taken by India after the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22 that killed 26 people, Pakistan closed its airspace for Indian airlines on April 24. The airspace closure has resulted in longer flying hours, higher fuel consumption, payload and aircraft availability issues as well as crew flying duty time limitation challenges for airlines operating international flights to the West. India also closed its airspace for Pakistan airlines on April 30."

The Sevur Nilakkadalai Urpathiyalargal Sangam is the applicant for Sevur Groundnut which is cultivated in Sevur village and its surrounding regions in Kangeyam taluk of Tiruppur. Villages including Padiyur, Nathakkadaiyur, Pappankulam, Nattaramangalam, Uthiyur, and Vellakovil also cultivate these groundnuts. These locations fall under semi-arid zones with red loamy and sandy soils, making them ideal for groundnut cultivation.

The region\u2019s proximity to the seacoast and its tropical climate creates the perfect environment for banana cultivation. The applicants in the filing mentioned that the humid conditions, combined with the fertile alluvial soils, allow the banana plants to thrive, producing fruits with distinct characteristics that are highly valued in both local and international markets.

The measures in the 23-page GR issued on May 13 include enhanced CCTV surveillance of classroom entrances, corridors, main entrances and exits, playgrounds, and outside toilets.

Noticeboards and the school\u2019s internal security wall should display information on these utilities. Students should also be educated about the child helpline number, 1098. Every school must have a trained, qualified, and experienced counsellor. Students facing bullying or physical harassment must use the complaint box, and the \u2018student safety committee\u2019 established at the school must take appropriate measures to protect the child.

The Committee\u2019s investigation encompassed site visits, consultations with stakeholders, and a review of administrative records. \u201cThe FFIC has concluded that the tragedy was entirely preventable and stemmed from a combination of poor planning, lack of enforcement, ignored directives, and inadequate infrastructure. The recommendations provided in this report aim to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future,\u201d it said. Based on field visits, interactions with eyewitnesses, injured victims, organisers, executive magistrates, police officials, and perusal of available records, the committee found that the stampede was precipitated by a confluence of preventable lapses and oversights among key stakeholders. The report stated, \u201cThe Committee has found that the immediate cause of the stampede was overcrowding on the pathway from Tali to Homkhand, particularly at the upper end of the sloped section near the RBL Bank Branch, Shirgao, aggravated by the unruly behaviour of the Dhonds and lack of proper crowd control measures at that location. The crowd was permitted to enter the pathway from Tali in groups, which were subsequently channelled into a two-by-two queue formation beyond the sloped section leading towards Homkhand.\u201d The committee stated it was imperative for organisers to conduct a comprehensive risk analysis and preparedness exercise and cooperate with authorities, incorporating their input in planning and execution. \u201cHowever, a review of the minutes of all pre-event meetings conducted by revenue and police officials revealed that the organisers did not provide critical information regarding the expected number of visitors, potential risks based on past incidents, or options for alternative circulation routes. On the contrary, the Committee found that the organisers appear to have disregarded specific instructions issued by the revenue and police authorities regarding crowd management, focusing instead solely on the conduct of religious activities,\u201d the report said."

A team of police officers led by Inspector Sumesh Sudhakaran allegedly forcibly stopped the conference as it was about to conclude at 10.06 p.m. The organisers had been given permission until 10 p.m. Thousands of students, most of them professional, watched the police action in dismay as Mr. Sudhakaran and his team reportedly shouted at the organisers. A video of Mr. Sudhakaran sneering at the students after halting their conference has gone viral on social media, sparking further outrage. \u201cIt was a meeting against drugs held with a blessing message from our Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan,\u201d said T.K. Ashraf, general secretary of the Wisdom Islamic Students Organisation.

But it took some extra time for us to make arrangements for the 25,000 students who turned up for the meet from different parts of the State. Still, we were about to conclude by 10.10 p.m. But it was unfortunate that the police made a bad show by disrupting a well-organised programme just two or three minutes before its natural end,\u201d said Mr. Ashraf.

File | Photo Credit: ANI Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday (May 13, 2025) underscored the importance of targeted interventions and technology-led outreach in the fight against tuberculosis, while chairing a high-level review meeting on the National TB Elimination Programme (NTEP) at his official residence. The Prime Minister emphasised the need to analyse TB patient data based on urban-rural distinctions and occupational categories. \u201cThis will help identify vulnerable groups requiring early testing and treatment, especially workers in construction, mining, textile and other high-risk sectors,\u201d Mr. Modi observed. Highlighting the curability of TB with regular treatment, the Prime Minister said the public must be made more aware, with less fear and more support. He called upon Nikshay Mitra \u2014volunteers who support TB patients, to leverage digital platforms and interactive technologies to engage with patients effectively. During the meeting, the Prime Minister reviewed encouraging data from the World Health Organization\u2019s Global TB Report 2024, which notes an 18% reduction in TB incidence in India - from 237 to 195 per lakh population between 2015 and 2023 - double the global pace. TB mortality in India fell by 21%, and treatment coverage rose to 85%. The decentralisation of TB services - free screening, diagnosis, treatment, and nutritional support - through Ayushman Arogya Mandirs was highlighted as a cornerstone of the programme\u2019s outreach. New initiatives introduced in recent months include shorter drug regimens for drug-resistant TB, indigenous molecular diagnostics, nutrition interventions, and screening in high-risk congregate settings such as mines, construction sites, urban slums and tea gardens. Since 2018, the Ni-kshay Poshan Yojana has facilitated Direct Benefit Transfer payments to 1.28 crore TB patients, with the incentive amount raised to \u20b91,000 in 2024. Under the Nikshay Mitra initiative, 2.55 lakh volunteers have distributed 29.4 lakh nutrition baskets to patients. The Prime Minister called for scaling up successful strategies nationwide and reaffirmed India\u2019s commitment to eliminating TB. The meeting also reviewed the 100-Day TB Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan, which screened 12.97 crore individuals in high-focus districts, resulting in the detection of 7.19 lakh TB cases - including 2.85 lakh asymptomatic patients. Over 1 lakh new Nikshay Mitra joined the effort during the campaign."

The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) now says the corridor will become functional in two stages \u2014 the elevated section stretching 7.5 km between Kalena Agrahara and Tavarekere will open by March 2026, while the 13.8-km underground segment from Dairy Circle to Nagawara is slated for completion by September 2026. The Pink Line, spanning a total of 21.3 km, is part of Phase 2 of the city\u2019s metro network expansion. It aims to connect the southern point of Kalena Agrahara on Bannerghatta Road with Nagawara on the Outer Ring Road in the northern part of the city. One of the most important segments of the Pink Line has been the 2.2-km stretch between Shivajinagar and Vellara. The complexity of tunnelling in this stretch delayed the progress significantly, contributing to the repeated rescheduling of project timelines, according to the official. In October 2024, BMRCL achieved a major milestone by completing tunnelling works for what is now the city\u2019s longest underground metro corridor. Although the underground section measures 14 km in length, the tunnelling work extended to 21 km owing to the twin-tunnel system. For many Bengaluru residents, the Pink Line remains a long-promised solution to the city\u2019s worsening traffic woes. Commuters who regularly travel between the city\u2019s northern, southern zones, and Central Business District (CBD) area are growing impatient over the constant postponements. \u201cEvery delay means another year stuck in traffic for two hours a day. I had hoped to be using the Pink Line by now. We need accountability, not just revised deadlines,\u201d said Nandita Rao, a resident of Bannerghatta Road whose workplace is on M.G. Road. Ravi Chandrashekhar, a resident of Pottery Town, said, \u201cI have to travel to Bannerghatta Road every day for work since my office is located there. Right now, I depend entirely on my bike. If the Pink Line becomes operational, it will make my life much easier. It feels like BMRCL keeps making promises only to break them later. The government needs to treat this with the urgency it deserves. The city is choking, and we\u2019re still waiting for the connectivity that was promised five years ago.\u201d Meanwhile, regarding the trains for this line, in August 2023, the Bengaluru-based public sector unit BEML Ltd. secured a contract to manufacture and maintain 318 metro coaches (53 trainsets) over 15 years. This included 96 coaches designated for the Pink Line, and 222 coaches for the Blue Line \u2014 which covers Phase 2A and 2B extensions. Adding to the fleet, in March 2025, BMRCL awarded BEML Ltd. an additional order for seven more trainsets specifically for the Pink Line. BEML Ltd. has committed to delivering a prototype train by June 2025, a crucial step before full-scale deployment can begin."

JCI officials have also asked farmers not to fall for middlemen, and sell below MSP to ensure sustainability and growth of the industry. The new MSP will be applicable from the new crop year which starts on July 1 for middle grade jute, and the prices for other grades will increase in parity. Officials said that a lack of information does create a lack of awareness among farmers about MSP and local JCI centres where they can sell their products. Farmers could use the Paat Mitro app to find the nearest centre among the 110 functioning in India. Mr. Chakraborty said that last year they sold around 600 tons of jute seeds; this year it has crossed 1,000 tons, an amount that exceeded their expectations. Jute production for the upcoming year is therefore expected to be sufficient. Last year the government of India procured over 5.05 lakh quintals of jute from farmers for \u20b9252.38 crores. Officials said that they are ready to buy as much as farmers can sell, in case they do not get better rates than the MSP in the open market. \u201cClimate change has had an impact on jute production over the years. Sowing of seeds has had to be preponed, and multiple cyclones have also impacted cultivation,\u201d Ajay Kumar Jolly, Managing Director of JCI, told The Hindu. The officials also shut down rumours of shortfalls in jute production and increasing prices, which he said was likely an attempt to artificially increase the price."

            "text": "The Election Commission (EC) on Tuesday (May 13, 2025) said it has resolved the long-pending problem of duplication of voter ID card numbers and issued fresh elector photo identity cards (EPIC) to those who faced the issue. The electors photo identity card (EPIC) number is the 10-digit voter ID card number issued by the EC to each elector. The number is a unique alphanumeric code assigned to each registered elector to prevent impersonation. EC sources said that in order to resolve the problem of duplication of numbers, the entire database of over 99 crore electors was searched by Chief Electoral Officers (CEO) of all the 36 States and Union Territories and electoral registration officers of all the 4,123 Assembly constituencies across India in all the 10.50 lakh polling stations. It was found that on average, around one voter in four polling stations faced the issue of EPIC number duplication, the sources added. There are about 1,000 electors per polling station. \u201cDuring the field-level verification, it was found that holders of such similar EPIC numbers were genuine electors in different Assembly constituencies and different polling stations. All such electors have since been issued new EPIC cards with new numbers,\u201d a senior official of the poll body told The Hindu. The EC responded two days later saying that irrespective of the EPIC number, a person can cast vote only once at their designated polling stations in their respective constituencies in their States or Union Territories. It had said that it would remove these duplications and ensure that each voter gets a unique EPIC number. The Trinamool, however, rejected the EC clarification saying it was a \u201ccover-up\u201d and said it was impossible for voters in two different constituencies to have the same EPIC number, citing the panel\u2019s own handbook. Every voter\u2019s name is on the electoral roll of the polling station, where he/she is an ordinary resident. Having similar EPIC numbers never enabled any such person to vote at any other polling station. Thus, the issue of duplication of EPIC numbers could not have impacted the results of any elections, it said."

While Trump had been claiming that his administration brokered the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, New Delhi has maintained that the Pakistani Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) called his Indian counterpart and requested an immediate truce as Pakistan was desperate following India's strikes. The journalist did not stop there and asked if Trump had a problem with India using Israeli-made drones in Operation Sindoor. He mentioned that while Trump wants to bring Jews, Muslims, and Christians together through the Abraham Accords, the use of Israeli drones could \"complicate relations between Pakistan and Israel.\""

In a speech delivered by Mr Shah at a gathering near Indore, he appeared to equate Col Qureshi's role in the military with a communal and gendered insult aimed at Pakistan and its people. The Congress has demanded his immediate removal from the state cabinet, while Mr Shah has since attempted to defuse the situation by offering multiple apologies.

I salute her for her service to the nation. We cannot even think of insulting her in our dreams. Still, if my words have hurt society and religion, then I am ready to apologise ten times,'' he said. During his speech, Mr Shah drew a connection between the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, which left 26 people dead, and Operation Sindoor. Referring obliquely but unmistakably to Col Qureshi, he claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent \"a sister from their [the terrorists'] community\" in an Indian Air Force aircraft to \"strip them of their pride\" and \"teach them a lesson.\" The Congress party termed Mr Shah's remarks \"derogatory, communal and shameful.\" Party president Mallikarjun Kharge issued a statement on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to sack Shah immediately. \"A minister of the BJP government of Madhya Pradesh has made a very derogatory, shameful and cheap remark about our brave daughter Colonel Sofiya Qureshi. The terrorists of Pahalgam wanted to divide the country, but the country was united during the entire 'Operation Sindoor' to give a befitting reply to the terrorists,\" Mr Kharge posted on X."

            "text": "A woman's decision to leave her job to take care of her child does not count as voluntary unemployment and she would be entitled to alimony, the Delhi High Court has ruled. The court has also stressed that it is not the wife's earning capacity, but her actual income, that must be considered while determining the maintenance amount. The high court was hearing a petition by the woman's estranged husband, challenging a 2023 court order to pay Rs 7,500 each to the woman and their six-year-old son. The husband said he was an advocate at a district court and earns only Rs 10,000 - Rs 15,000. He said his estranged wife was highly educated and was Rs 40,000-Rs 50,000 a month before she quit her teaching job. The petitioner argued that since his estranged wife is capable of earning, she is not entitled to maintenance. He said he was struggling financially and emotionally and could not comply with the maintenance order. The woman's lawyer said her estranged husband is financially stable and has rental income besides earnings from his legal career. \"It is argued that the respondent is currently unable to engage in employment due to her responsibilities in caring for their minor son, and her past employment as a teacher cannot be a valid ground to deny her rightful maintenance,\" the order said. The woman said that she was working as a teacher but had to quit the job because it took long hours to commute and she did not find a job near her home. The woman said she had to give up her teaching career to take care of her minor child as a single parent. The court said it finds the woman's arguments explaining why she quit her job \"both reasonable and justified\". \"It is well settled that the responsibility of caregiving to a minor child falls disproportionately upon the parent with custody, often limiting their ability to pursue full-time employment, especially in cases where there is no family support also to take care of the child while the mother is at work. In such circumstances, the cessation of employment by the respondent cannot be viewed as voluntary abandonment of work, but as a consequence necessitated by the paramount duty of child care,\" the order said. Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma cited a Supreme Court ruling that mere capability to earn is not the same as actually earning, and being capable of earning alone is not a valid reason to reduce maintenance. \"It is not the potential earning capacity of the wife but her actual income at the relevant time that is to be considered while determining the amount of maintenance. Thus, the learned Family Court has rightly observed that there exists a material distinction between being \"capable of earning\" and \"actually earning\". The court said the family court assessed the husband's notional monthly income at Rs 30,000 because he had been working since 2010. This, the high court said, is not entirely disproportionate."

Sinwar is believed to be one of the senior-most Hamas military commanders left in Gaza after over a year and a half of war with Israel. He is the younger brother of Yahya Sinwar, the former Hamas leader who was killed by Israeli forces in 2023. Yahya Sinwar had masterminded the October 7, 2023, attacks that set off the war. Since the beginning of in Gaza Strip, Israeli officials have accused Hamas of operating from inside Gaza's hospitals - a claim denied by Hamas, as well as hospital officials. Meanwhile, Israel has threatened a major escalation of military offensive in Gaza despite ongoing ceasefire efforts. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that the military would enter Gaza \"with full force\" in the coming days, unless Hamas surrenders its weapons and returns around 20 living hostages it still holds, along with the remains of 40 others. Earlier, the military said it had struck Hamas militants inside \"a command and control centre\" at Nasser Hospital, also in Khan Yunis. Gaza's health ministry said that the strike killed two people. One of the dead was journalist Hassan Aslih, the civil defence said. Israel had accused Aslih of participating in Hamas's October 7, 2023, attacks. Throughout the war, Israel has methodically eliminated Hamas's leadership, killing not only Yahya Sinwar but also Muhammad Deif, the head of its military wing; Ismail Haniyeh, the group's political chief; and numerous others. Hamas is designated a \"terrorist organisation\" by Washington."

            "title": "Landmark Verdicts Delivered By India's New Chief Justice BR Gavai",
            "text": "The law ministry on April 29 issued notification announcing Justice Gavai's appointment as the 52nd CJI. Justice Bhushan Ramkrishna Gavai, India's 52nd chief justice and its first Buddhist one, has played a key role in shaping the judicial landscape, penning about 300 verdicts, including landmark rulings on constitutional issues, liberty, and perhaps most importantly against the executive's \"bulldozer justice\". Justice Gavai, the second Dalit after K G Balakrishnan to head the Indian judiciary, was sworn in by President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday for a six-month tenure ending November 23, 2025. Rising from humble beginnings to the highest judicial office of the land, Justice Gavai belongs to a village in Maharashtra's Amravati district. He touched his mother's feet after taking oath of office at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Born on November 24, 1960, the Amaravati born is the son of R S Gavai, a career politician, who started the Republican Party of India (Gavai). Elevated as a judge of the Supreme Court on May 24, 2019, Justice Gavai was part of constitution benches that delivered path-breaking verdicts, including on Article 370, electoral bonds and demonetisation of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes. It was a bench headed by Justice Gavai that stayed the Allahabad High Court's observations on grabbing a woman's breasts and pulling the drawstrings of her \"pyjama\" not amounting to attempt to rape, and said it reflected total \"insensitivity\" and \"inhuman approach\". During his tenure as an supreme court judge in the last six years, Justice Gavai was part of around 700 benches dealing with matters pertaining to a range of subjects, including constitutional and administrative law, civil and criminal law, commercial disputes, arbitration law and environmental law. He authored about 300 judgments, including constitution bench verdicts on various issues upholding the rule of law and safeguarding fundamental, human and legal rights of the citizens. As the CJI, Justice Gavai will have to deal with issues such as the huge pendency of cases, including over 81,000 cases in the Supreme Court, to vacancies in courts. Days before being sworn in as the CJI, Justice Gavai told journalists in an informal chat with journalists at his residence here that the Constitution is supreme. He also made it clear he would not take any post-retirement assignments. He was part of a five-judge constitution bench which in December 2023 unanimously upheld the Centre's decision to abrogate provisions of Article 370 bestowing special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. Another five-judge constitution bench, of which Justice Gavai was a part, annulled the electoral bonds scheme for political funding. He was also part of a five-judge constitution bench which, by a 4:1 majority verdict, gave the stamp of approval to the Centre's 2016 decision to demonetise Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 denomination currency notes. Justice Gavai was part of a seven-judge constitution bench, which by a 6:1 majority held that states are constitutionally empowered to make sub-classifications within the Scheduled Castes, which form a socially heterogeneous class, for granting reservation for the uplift of castes that are socially and educationally more backward among them. A seven-judge constitution bench, including Justice Gavai, ruled that arbitration clause in an unstamped or insufficiently stamped agreement between parties was enforceable as such a defect was curable and did not render the contract invalid. Justice Gavai was part of a five-judge constitution bench, which in January 2023 ruled that additional restrictions cannot be imposed on the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression of high public functionaries as exhaustive grounds already exist under the Constitution to curb that right. He penned a landmark verdict laying down pan-India guidelines on demolition and said no property should be demolished without a prior showcause notice and the affected must be given 15 days to respond. Justice Gavai has delivered lectures on various constitutional and environmental issues in various universities and organisations, including Columbia University and Harvard University. He was elevated as an additional judge of the Bombay High Court on November 14, 2003. He became a permanent judge of the high court on November 12, 2005. Justice Gavai was appointed as a government pleader and public prosecutor for the Nagpur bench on January 17, 2000. His predecessor Sanjiv Khanna on April 16 recommended to the Centre Justice Gavai's name as the next CJI. The law ministry on April 29 issued a notification announcing Justice Gavai's appointment as the 52nd CJI."

Gavai who was administered the oath of office by President Droupadi Murmu early on Wednesday as the 52nd Chief Justice of India (CJI), is the first Buddhist to head the country's judiciary. CJI Gavai, will have a tenure of over six months, and he will demit the highest judicial office of the country on November 23, 2025. President Murmu, in exercise of powers under Article 124(2) of the Constitution, had appointed Justice Gavai, the senior most Judge of the Supreme Court, as Chief Justice of India, and the Ministry of Law and Justice had later notified his appointment on April 29. Justice Gavai was elevated as a Judge of the Supreme Court of India on May 24, 2019. Before elevation to the Bench, he practised in constitutional law and administrative law and acted as Standing Counsel for Municipal Corporation of Nagpur, Amravati Municipal Corporation, and Amravati University. Earlier, in an informal interaction with the media, Justice Gavai expressed sorrow over the tragic incident in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam and said that the Supreme Court cannot remain untouched when the country is mourning. Son of former Bihar Governor R.S. Gavai, Justice Gavai also took pride in the fact that he would be the first Buddhist CJI of the country. \"My father had embraced Buddhism along with Baba Saheb Ambedkar. I will become the first Buddhist Chief Justice of the country,\" he said. Asserting that he believes in all religions, Justice Gavai said, \"I go to temples, dargahs, Jain temples, gurudwaras everywhere.\" In the Supreme court, Justice Gavai, a part of the 7-judge Constitution Bench dealing with the question of whether a sub-classification among reserved category groups for giving more beneficial treatment would be permissible under the Constitution, suggested the application of the \"creamy layer\" principle to the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) for availing benefits of affirmative action. In his detailed opinion, Justice Gavai said: \"When the 9-Judge Bench in Indra Sawhney held that applicability of such a test (creamy layer test) insofar as Other Backward Classes are concerned would advance equality as enshrined in the Constitution, then why such a test should not also be made applicable to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\" Justice Gavai said putting the children of the parents from the SCs and STs who, on account of the benefit of reservation, have reached a high position and ceased to be socially, economically and educationally backward and the children of parents doing manual work in the villages in the same category would defeat the constitutional mandate."

Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma in an order on May 13 said the situation could be viewed as a consequence of the paramount duty to look after the child. \"It is well settled that the responsibility of caregiving to a minor child falls disproportionately upon the parent with custody, often limiting their ability to pursue full-time employment, especially in cases where there is no family support to take care of the child while the mother is at work,\" the court said. The verdict, therefore, noted the cessation of employment by the woman cannot be viewed as \"voluntary abandonment of work, but as a consequence necessitated by the paramount duty of child care\". The man challenged the trial court's order on the ground that the woman was highly educated and previously worked as a guest teacher in a Delhi government school, earning between Rs 40,000 and Rs 50,000 monthly, including tuition money. The man argued that the family court erred in not considering the fact that the woman left her matrimonial home on her own volition and did not resume her ties with the husband despite a court order. The woman, on the other hand, submitted she was unable to work owing to her responsibilities towards the child. She said her past employment wasn't a valid ground to deny her rightful maintenance and argued since it took long hours to commute and she couldn't find work near home, she gave up her teaching career."

Palestinians in Gaza may face starvation within weeks if aid is not allowed in soon, Israeli defence officials have admitted. Three military officers monitoring the situation in Gaza said many areas may soon run out of enough food to meet basic daily needs. Most bakeries in Gaza have shut down, charity kitchens are closing, and the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) says it has nothing left to distribute. The officers said that unless the blockade is lifted urgently, the crisis will worsen, as per The New York Times. For months, Israel has said that its blockade on food and fuel in Gaza does not seriously harm civilians. Since it takes time to restart aid deliveries, the officers believe urgent action is needed now to avoid a food crisis. On Monday, a UN-supported group called the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification said famine was imminent in Gaza. They warned that if Israel continued with more military attacks, \"the vast majority of people in the Gaza Strip would not have access to food, water, shelter, and medicine.\" Since March 2, Israel has blocked all humanitarian aid, including food, water, fuel, and medicine, from entering Gaza. This blockade has been described by the United Nations as \"deliberate and unashamedly\" imposing inhumane conditions on Palestinians, placing them at severe risk of famine. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that rising malnutrition rates in Gaza may have lasting effects on an entire generation of children, with 11 per cent suffering from acute malnutrition in some areas. Israel maintains that the blockade is necessary to prevent aid from reaching Hamas. UN officials argue that starving civilians cannot be justified."

            "text": "Cassie sued Combs in 2023 alleging years of rape and abuse. R&B singer Cassie testifies in Sean Diddy Combs\u2019 sex trafficking trial, alleging years of abuse and coercion. Combs, who has pleaded not guilty, faces multiple charges stemming from a civil lawsuit Cassie filed in 2023. Casandra Ventura, the R&B singer and actor known simply as Cassie, began testifying Tuesday in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs ' sex trafficking trial. She is expected to return to the stand on Wednesday. The music mogul is charged with leveraging his status to coerce women - including Cassie - into abusive sexual encounters and using violence if they refused. He has pleaded not guilty. Cassie sued Combs in 2023 alleging years of rape and abuse. The suit was settled within hours, but was followed by dozens of similar legal claims and touched off a criminal investigation. A singer, actor, dancer and model, Cassie's professional ambitions began in adolescence, when she signed to the top-tier talent and modeling agency Wilhelmina. Her music career launched shortly thereafter, when she left her home state of Connecticut for New York, where she signed with manager Tony Mottola and first met Combs. Cassie is perhaps best known for the 2006 hit single \"Me & U,\" which secured the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop songs chart and No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 all genres chart. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The song was the lead single of her only studio album, released by Combs' Bad Boy Records, and was self-titled. She left the label in 2019. Cassie met Combs in 2005 when she was 19 and he was 37. He signed her to his Bad Boy Records label and, within a few years, they started dating. In her 2023 civil lawsuit, Cassie alleges Combs trapped her in a \"cycle of abuse, violence, and sex trafficking\" for more than a decade, including raping her and forcing her to engage in sex acts with male sex workers. Combs settled the lawsuit the next day. In May 2024, CNN aired video that showed Combs attacking Cassie in a hotel hallway in 2016. The video closely mirrored an assault described in her lawsuit, which said Combs had already punched her that night, and she was trying to leave the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles when he woke and came after her. In the footage, a man who appears to be Diddy, wearing only a towel, punches Cassie, kicks her, and throws her on to the floor. The lawsuit alleges Combs paid $50,000 to bury the video at the time. Later, Combs apologized for the assault on Cassie in his first real acknowledgment of wrongdoing since the stream of allegations began. Among other things, Cassie alleges Combs raped her when she tried to leave him and often punched, kicked and beat her, causing injuries including bruises, burst lips, black eyes and bleeding. She also alleges that Combs was involved in blowing up rival rapper Kid Cudi's car when he learned that Cudi was romantically interested in her, and she alleges that Combs ran out of his home with guns when he learned that Suge Knight, a rival producer, was eating at a nearby diner. On the first day of Combs' sex trafficking trial, a witness, Daniel Phillip, said he was a professional stripper who was paid $700 to $6,000 to have sex with Cassie while Combs watched and gave instructions, with the first encounter in 2012."

            "title": "Apple's New Tech May Soon Let People Control iPhones With Their Brain",
            "text": "Apple is making strides towards a future where people control their iPhones with thoughts, using brain implants, according to a report in a leading American daily. This is similar to the vision of Elon Musk's Neuralink. The tech giant is reportedly working closely with Synchron, a brain-interface company, which has developed a stent-like device called the Stentrode, The Wall Street Journal reported. This implant is inserted into a blood vessel near the brain's motor cortex and reads brain signals to control digital devices. Such technology could be life-changing for people with severe spinal cord injuries, ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), or those recovering from strokes. These implants work by picking up brain activity and turning it into digital commands. A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), as it is called, allows the brain to communicate directly with a computer or device. When a person thinks, the brain sends out signals. BCIs capture those signals through sensors and convert them into actions, like moving a cursor, typing, or opening apps, without needing to touch the screen. The Stentrode works with Apple's built-in feature called \"switch control,\" which lets users change how they interact with their devices, switching from a joystick to a brain signal. He said Apple's new standard, expected to be released later this year, will make it easier for developers to connect implants directly with devices. One early user, Mark Jackson, who has ALS, uses the Synchron device to operate Apple's Vision Pro headset and his iPhone from home. He can't travel or stand, but the brain-implant lets him access Apple's devices in a new way. He told WSJ that through the headset, he was \"able to peer over the ledge of a mountain in the Swiss Alps and feel my legs shake.\" Elon Musk's Neuralink has already implanted its device, the N1, in a human. It has over 1,000 electrodes placed inside the brain, capturing far more data than Synchron's 16 electrodes that sit on top. Neuralink's first user can move a cursor with thoughts faster than some people using a mouse. Musk has said that such implants could one day boost brain power and help people compete with advanced artificial intelligence. Morgan Stanley estimates around 150,000 Americans with serious upper-limb impairments could be early users of brain-implant tech. They predict the first commercial approval could come by 2030, but Synchron's CEO believes it could happen sooner."

The Padma Shri awardee has also taken inspiration from the French Riviera and the impressionist style that developed in France mid-to-late 19th century, characterised by visible brushstrokes and strong emphasises on light and its effect on colour. Looking forward to catching up on world cinema and discussing his art with those in attendance at the film festival, Maity also intends to paint during the trip. On his itinerary are visits to art museums and galleries. \u201cI\u2019ll be here till the end of the month and intend to make the most of it, including painting,\u201d says the artist.

(Photo: The Canadian Press via AP) Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has criticised Britain\u2019s invitation to Donald Trump for a second state visit, saying it undermined his government\u2019s effort to project a united front against the US president\u2019s talk of annexing Canada. Since taking office in January, Trump has repeatedly said he wants Canada to become the 51st US state \u2014 a suggestion that has angered Canadians and left Britain trying to tread a fine line between the two North American countries.

(AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko, File) Former Uruguayan President Jos\u00e9 Mujica, a onetime Marxist guerilla and flower farmer whose radical brand of democracy, plain-spoken philosophy and simple lifestyle fascinated people around the world, has died. He was 89. Uruguay\u2019s left-wing president, Yamand\u00fa Orsi, announced his death, which came four months after Mujica decided to forgo further medical treatment for esophageal cancer and enter hospice care at his three-room ranch house on the outskirts of Montevideo, Uruguay\u2019s capital. \u201cPresident, activist, guide and leader,\u201d Orsi wrote of his longtime political mentor before heading to Mujica\u2019s home to pay his respects. \u201cThank you for everything you gave us.\u201d Mujica had been under treatment for cancer of the esophagus since his diagnosis last spring. Radiation eliminated much of the tumor but soon Mujica\u2019s autoimmune disease complicated his recovery. In January, Mujica\u2019s doctor announced that the cancer in his esophagus had returned and spread to his liver. In recent days, \u201che knew that he was in his final hours,\u201d said Fernando Pereira, the president of Mujica\u2019s left-wing Broad Front party who visited the ailing ex-leader last week. Uruguay\u2019s President Jose Mujica, left, and his wife Lucia Topolansky attend a flag ceremony in Montevideo, Uruguay. (AP Photo/Matilde Campodonico, File) As leader of a violent leftist guerrilla group in the 1960s known as the Tupamaros, Mujica robbed banks, planted bombs and abducted businessmen and politicians on Montevideo\u2019s streets in hopes of provoking a popular uprising that would lead to a Cuban-style socialist Uruguay. During his 2010-2015 presidency, Mujica, widely known as \u201cPepe,\u201d oversaw the transformation of his small South American nation into one of the world\u2019s healthiest and most socially liberal democracies. He earned admiration at home and cult status abroad for legalizing marijuana and same-sex marriage, enacting the region\u2019s first sweeping abortion rights law and establishing Uruguay as a leader in alternative energy. \u201cThis is the tragedy of life, on the one hand it\u2019s beautiful, but it ends,\u201d Mujica told The Associated Press in a wide-ranging Oct. 2023 interview from his farmhouse. \u201cTherefore, paradise is here. As is hell.\u201d As the Uruguayan government declared three days of national mourning, tributes poured in from presidents and ordinary people around the world. The first to share remembrances were allied leaders who recalled not only Mujica\u2019s accomplishments but also his hallowed status as one of the last surviving lions of the now-receding Latin American left that peaked two decades ago. Colombian President Gustavo Petro praised Mujica as a \u201cgreat revolutionary.\u201d Bolivia\u2019s former socialist president, Evo Morales said that he \u201cand all of Latin America\u201d are in mourning. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum called Mujica \u201can example for Latin America and the entire world.\u201d Brazil\u2019s Foreign Ministry described him as \u201cone of the most important humanists of our time.\u201d Chile\u2019s leftist President Gabriel Boric paid tribute to Mujica\u2019s efforts to combat social inequality. Mujica never attended university and didn\u2019t finish high school. But politics piqued his interest as early as adolescence, when the young flower farmer joined the progressive wing of the conservative National Party, one of the two main parties in Uruguay. His pivot to urban guerrilla warfare came in the 1960s, as leftist struggles swept the region in the wake of the Cuban Revolution. Mujica was shot six times in a firefight with police in a bar. He helped stage a prison break and twice escaped custody. But in 1973 the military seized power, unleashing a reign of terror upon the population that resulted in the forced disappearance of some 200 Uruguayans and the imprisonment of thousands. After power returned to civilians in 1985, Mujica left prison under an amnesty that covered the crimes of the dictators and their guerrilla opponents. He entered mainstream politics with the Broad Front, a coalition of radical leftists and centrist social democrats. Rapidly rising through the party ranks, Mujica charmed the country with his low-key way of living and penchant for speaking his mind. In 2005 he entered government with the Broad Front as an agricultural minister. Just four years later he was Uruguay\u2019s 40th president, elected with 52% of the vote. His wife, Luc\u00eda Topolansky, a former co-revolutionary guerrilla member who was also imprisoned before becoming a prominent politician, bestowed the presidential sash on Mujica at his inauguration \u2014 as is custom for the senator who had received the most votes. They married in 2005 and had no children. \u201cI\u2019ve been with him for over 40 years, and I\u2019ll be with him until the end,\u201d she told a local radio station Sunday as Mujica\u2019s condition deteriorated. Over his years in power, Mujica presided over comfortable economic growth, rising wages and falling poverty. In speeches, he pushed Uruguayans to reject consumerism and embrace their nation\u2019s tradition of simplicity. Under his watch, the small nation became known worldwide for the strength of its institutions and the civility of its politics \u2014 rare features most recently on display during Uruguay\u2019s 2024 presidential vote that vaulted Orsi, Mujica\u2019s moderate prot\u00e9g\u00e9, to power. Mujica\u2019s greatest innovations came on social issues. During his term, Uruguay became the first country in South America to legalize abortion for the first trimester and the first in the world to legalize the production, distribution and sale of marijuana. His government also legalized same-sex marriage, burnishing Uruguay\u2019s progressive image in the predominantly Catholic region. Mujica\u2019s government also powered a green energy revolution that transformed Uruguay into one of the world\u2019s most environmentally friendly nations. Today the country generates 98% of its electricity from biomass, solar and wind energy. Still, Mujica ended his tenure with a 60% approval rating. Ineligible to seek re-election because of a ban on consecutive terms, he continued to wield influence at home as an elected senator and abroad as a trailblazer and sage."

(AP Photo) A 14th-century Korean Buddhist statue stolen from a Japanese temple nearly 13 years ago was returned on Monday, following a years-long legal battle between Japan and South Korea over its ownership that had further strained sensitive ties between the two Asian neighbours. Dozens of temple members and local residents standing by the roadside applauded to welcome the statue as a truck carrying a wooden container with it arrived at Kannonji, a temple on Japan\u2019s western island of Tsushima. The statue is expected to be kept at a local museum following a ceremony at the temple later in the day. The gilt bronze statue Bodhisattva \u2014 a female goddess of mercy \u2014 is depicted in a sitting position and measures about 50 centimetres (20 inches) in height. It has been designated a cultural asset of the region and was one of two statues stolen in 2012 from Kannonji by thieves who were looking to sell them in South Korea. The South Korean government had returned the other statue to the Japanese temple soon after the authorities recovered it from the thieves, who were arrested and charged. But the Bodhisattva became trapped in a legal dispute after Buseoksa, a South Korean temple in the western coastal city of Seosan, filed a lawsuit, claiming it as the rightful owner. South Korea\u2019s Supreme Court in 2023 ruled in favour of the Japanese temple, ordering the South Korean temple to return the statue. After all the paperwork was completed in January, the statue remained on a 100-day loan to the South Korean temple for a farewell exhibit. Sekko Tanaka, a former head monk at Kannonji, told reporters that the handover ceremony at the South Korean temple on Saturday was \u201ctruly amicable and we shook hands.\u201d \u201cA calm after a storm,\u201d he said, adding that he felt relieved to see the dispute resolved while he is still alive.

Japan and South Korea have long had disputes over Japanese atrocities during its 1910\u20131945 colonisation of the Korean Peninsula, though their ties have improved due to shared concern over regional security."

Currently, Japan faces a 25% levy on economically crucial auto exports to the United States, and a reciprocal 24% tariff on other Japanese goods. In terms of supporting the domestic economy, Ishiba said that the government needs to think carefully about a mooted reduction in consumption tax."

Ukraine will continue their total mobilisation, bringing new troops to (the) frontline,\u201d Peskov said. \u201cUkraine will use this period to train new military personnel and to give a rest to their existing ones. So why should we grant such an advantage to Ukraine?\u201d US President Donald Trump urged Russia and Ukraine on Friday to \u201cget this stupid war finished\u201d, as he pushed for a 30-day ceasefire that Ukraine says it is willing to agree to. But Peskov, in the interview, restated Russian concerns that Putin had made public as far back as March 13 and set out in a phone call with Trump on March 18. \u201cA ceasefire was supported by President Putin, but he asked several questions. He said that right now we have certain dynamics on the front, Russian troops are advancing, and advancing in quite a confident way,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if we speak about ceasefire, what are we going to do with shipments of weapons coming every day from the United States and from European countries?\u201d His comments underlined the lack of any shift in Russia\u2019s position on a ceasefire since mid-March. During that time Trump, who previously had applied intense pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has shown growing impatience with Russia and questioned whether Putin was \u201ctapping me along\u201d. \u201cPresident Putin is doing whatever is possible to solve the problem, to achieve a settlement through peaceful and diplomatic means. But having no peaceful and diplomatic means at hand, we have to continue the military operation,\u201d he said. Russia hoped that mediation by Trump would help to bring \u201ca little bit more flexibility, a little bit more political will and wisdom to the Kyiv regime\u201d, Peskov said. Putin declared a brief Easter ceasefire last month, which both sides accused each other of violating countless times, and another three-day pause this week as Russia marks the 80th anniversary of victory in World War Two. Ukraine did not agree to the latest truce, saying it wanted a halt of 30 days or more."

The timing raised questions over the apparent willingness of some politicians to seek rapprochement even as Moscow wages war on a German ally. In Stegner\u2019s case, critics also raised security concerns: Members of the parliamentary control committee have privileged, confidential access to the work of Germany\u2019s foreign and domestic security services, both of them heavily involved in gathering intelligence relating to Russia and the war."

            "text": "Saudi Arabia has held off formally joining the BRICS bloc of nations despite attending a meeting in Brazil last week, two sources said, finessing an issue that could upset Washington as Riyadh seeks to seal deals with its US ally. The issue of BRICS membership has been diplomatically sensitive for Saudi Arabia since it was first invited to join in 2023, and remains so with President Donald Trump due to visit next week and Riyadh negotiating nuclear and technology deals. BRICS, founded as a grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa to counter Western dominance of the world order, has grown in recent years to include emerging economies such as the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Indonesia. But while the BRICS website shows Saudi Arabia \u2013 the world\u2019s largest oil exporter \u2013 as a member, it has yet to join, according to the two sources, both with direct knowledge of Saudi policy. Saudi Arabia\u2019s government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Brazil\u2019s foreign ministry referred Reuters to the Saudi government when asked about the kingdom\u2019s listed status as a member on the website. Brazil is currently presiding over BRICS. Riyadh does not want to risk US anger as negotiations are underway with Washington, one of the sources and a diplomat said. The kingdom\u2019s ambivalence about BRICS membership lays bare its high-stakes balancing act between China, its biggest oil export customer, and Washington, its indispensable security and technology partner \u2013 a tightrope walk made ever more precarious by the deepening US-Chinese divide. \u201cThe Saudis still see tons of value in engaging with BRICS and its member states. They will keep double-dipping \u2013 or multi-dipping \u2013 with global partnerships as long as they can,\u201d said Robert Mogielnicki, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. \u201cI think the Saudi calculation is that what they may be able to get out of the US outweighs what they could get from BRICS membership, at least over the short term.\u201d While the kingdom still favors its historic ally the United States, it is also seeking to nurture trade ties with China, the largest importer of Saudi crude. The Saudi partnership with the United States remains central to its security, investment and technology ambitions, even as it expands relations with rival powers like China and Russia. Also Read: | Saudi Arabia and India \u2014 together let\u2019s ready, steady, esports \u201cWhile BRICS is a useful forum for airing grievances over American behaviour, it is not yet a body coherent enough to provide public goods on key issues like currency cooperation, security, or economic integration,\u201d said Steffen Hertog, associate professor in comparative politics at the London School of Economics. \u201cSaudi feels like they have the leverage and they are enjoying the position,\u201d said Saudi analyst Aziz Alghashian. \u201cThey see it that the United States is still the main actor, but there are others that could also provide utility,\u201d he added."

Daily Sabah reported that 1,300 pagers and 710 chargers rigged with explosives were confiscated inside a cargo shipment at Istanbul Airport that was on its way to Beirut from Hong Kong. A Turkish security official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, confirmed the report but would not provide further details. In Beirut, Hezbollah\u2019s chief spokesman Youssef el-Zein told The Associated Press Tuesday that days after the September. 17 pagers attack in Lebanon and Syria, Hezbollah informed Turkish intelligence that a shipment of pagers was in Turkey and about to be sent to Lebanon. El-Zein said Turkish authorities confiscated the pagers and most likely destroyed them. He had no further details. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. Israel triggered the Sept. 17 attack when pagers all over Lebanon started beeping. The devices exploded even if a person carrying one failed to push buttons to read an incoming encrypted message. The next day, Israel activated walkie-talkies, some of which exploded at funerals for some of the people who were killed in the pager attacks. The attacks marked a major escalation in the Israel-Hezbollah war that started after Hamas launched its attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, triggering the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip. Although the Lebanon attack struck many Hezbollah members, civilians were also killed or wounded. At least 37 people were killed, including two children, and some 3,000 were wounded in the two-day explosions. Daily Sabah said that acting on a tip that a shipment of pager devices would be in Istanbul to be delivered to Lebanon two days after the attacks, Turkish intelligence agents launched an operation. The newspaper said that authorities discovered a shipment that arrived in Istanbul from Hong Kong one day before the Lebanon explosions. The cargo had 61 boxes and was scheduled to depart from Istanbul to Beirut on Sept. 27 through Istanbul Airport. The cargo was described as a shipment of food choppers, Daily Sabah said. Inside, authorities found 1,300 Gold Apollo brand pagers and 710 desktop chargers. After the pagers attack, Israel expanded the war against Hezbollah with strikes that killed nearly 500 people on Sept. 23, forcing hundreds of thousands to flee their homes."

(AP Photo) Preparations for the conclave to find a new pope accelerated Friday with the installation of the chimney out of the Sistine Chapel that will signal the election of a successor to Pope Francis. Vatican firefighters were seen on the roof of the Sistine Chapel installing the chimney, a key moment in the preparation for the May 7 conclave. After every two rounds of voting in the Sistine Chapel, the ballots of the cardinals are burned in a special furnace to indicate the outcome to the outside world. If no pope is chosen, the ballots are mixed with cartridges containing potassium perchlorate, anthracene (a component of coal tar) and sulfur to produce black smoke. But if there is a winner, the burning ballots are mixed with potassium chlorate, lactose and chloroform resin to produce the white smoke. The white smoke came out of the chimney on the fifth ballot on March 13, 2013, and Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was introduced to the world as Pope Francis a short time later from the loggia of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. The chimney installation took place as cardinals arrived in the Vatican for another day of pre-conclave discussions about the needs of the Catholic Church going forward and the type of pope needed to run it. These consultations include all cardinals, including those over age 80 who are ineligible to vote in the conclave itself."

(Photo: Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service via AP) North Korea and Russia have begun building their first road link, the two countries announced, hailing the construction of a bridge over a border river as a major development that will further expand their booming ties. Russia\u2019s Tass news agency reported Wednesday that the bridge would be 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) long and its construction is expected to take 1 \u00bd years, and North Korea\u2019s Korean Central News Agency said the bridge would expand cross-border travel of people, tourism and circulation of commodities. Relations and exchange programs between the two countries have been flourishing in recent years, with North Korea supplying ammunitions and troops to support Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. One railway bridge and air service already connect North Korea and Russia, and in June 2024, the two countries agreed to construct a bridge for automobiles over the Tumen River, which runs along North Korea\u2019s borders with Russia and China. On Thursday, North Korea and Russia simultaneously held a ground-breaking ceremony for the bridge\u2019s construction in their respective border cities, according to the two countries\u2019 state media agencies. The agencies said North Korean Premier Pak Thae Song and Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin attended the ceremony via video links. Pak said the bridge\u2019s construction would be remembered as \u201ca historic monument\u201d in bilateral ties, KCNA reported Thursday. \u201cThis is a big milestone for Russian-Korean relation,\u201d Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said, according to Tass. \u201cWe are creating a reliable basis for closer cooperation between our two countries, a road for an open and fruitful dialogue.\u201d On Monday, North Korea confirmed for the first time that it has sent combat troops to Russia to help it reclaim parts of the Kursk region that Ukraine forces seized in a stunning incursion last year. Russian President Vladimir Putin thanked North Korea and promised not to forget the sacrifices of North Korean soldiers for Russia. In return for North Korea\u2019s supply of conventional arms, Russia has given it air defense missiles, electronic warfare equipment, drones and technology for spy satellite launches, according to the South Korean assessment."

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) An estimated 4,700 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded while fighting alongside Russia against Ukrainian forces, South Korea\u2019s spy agency told lawmakers Wednesday. The assessment came two days after North Korea confirmed for the first time that it had sent combat troops to help Russia recapture parts of the Kursk region, which it lost control of to a surprise Ukrainian incursion last year. In a closed-door parliamentary committee briefing, South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service said North Korea had suffered 4,700 casualties, including 600 deaths, on the Russia-Ukraine battlefronts, according to Lee Seong Kweun, one of the lawmakers who attended the meeting. Lee told reporters the NIS said that 2,000 injured North Korean soldiers were repatriated to North Korea by air or train between January and March. He cited the NIS as saying the dead North Korean soldiers were cremated in Russia before their remains were sent back home. In January, the NIS said about 300 North Korean soldiers had died and another 2,700 had been injured, and the South Korean military increased the estimated casualties to 4,000 last month. On Monday, North Korea announced that leader Kim Jong Un had decided to dispatch troops to \u201cannihilate and wipe out the Ukrainian neo-Nazi occupiers and liberate the Kursk area in cooperation with the Russian armed forces.\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin later issued a statement thanking North Korea and promising not to forget the sacrifices of North Korean soldiers. Both Kim and Putin said the North Korean deployment was made under their countries\u2019 landmark 2024 defense treaty, which requires each side to provide aid if the other is attacked. The U.S., South Korea and their partners say North Korea has been supplying vast amounts of conventional weapons to replenish Russia\u2019s depleted stocks as well. They suspect Russia is providing North Korea with military and economic assistance in return. U.S., South Korean and Ukraine officials have said North Korea dispatched 10,000-12,000 troops to Russia last fall. South Korea\u2019s military said in March that North Korea sent about 3,000 additional troops to Russia earlier this year. Kim quoted the NIS as saying that 15,000 North Korean laborers have also been sent to Russia under bilateral industrial cooperation programs. The lawmaker said the amount of North Korean missiles and artillery sent to Russia was worth billions of dollars but the NIS hasn\u2019t detected signs that Russia has sent North Korea cash remittances for them."

More than 350 grants initially worth more than $800 million were ended midstream, sparking layoffs and program closures. The disabilities nonprofit had to lay off nearly half its 26 workers after the government canceled $3 million in direct grants, about $1 million of which had already been spent, and ended pass-through grants from other organizations. \u201cThis is highly unusual,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cYou expect any administration to have their own priorities, and to implement that in future budget years and with future awards. You would not expect \u2026 grants that have already been granted, obligated or awarded to be pulled back.\u201dThe Office of Justice Programs typically awards nearly $4 billion in grants annually. It was unclear how much money it would take back since some rescinded grants were initially awarded as far back as 2021. Grantees were locked out of the financial system a few days before they were due to be reimbursed for already completed work. A department spokesperson did not respond to questions about the cuts. The cancellation notices noted that grant holders had 30 days to appeal. As of Friday, the department had reversed course on a handful of grants, restoring some funding. While cities and law enforcement agencies largely escaped direct cuts, many are feeling the impacts of cancellations to partner programs. In a scathing briefing Wednesday, New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin noted nearly $13 million in ongoing program funding to the state was canceled.\u201cTo say, \u2018We\u2019re going to cut programs that protect people from bias, that help people with opioid addiction, that keep guns off our streets\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s irresponsible, it\u2019s reckless, it\u2019s dangerous, and it\u2019s going to get people killed,\u201d Platkin said.

Germany, France and Britain last week called on Israel to adhere to international law by allowing the unhindered passage of humanitarian aid into Gaza, after Israel reiterated that no aid would be allowed to enter Gaza, in order to pressure Hamas. Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of hijacking humanitarian aid that was allowed into Gaza. Hamas has denied the allegations and has blamed Israel for shortages.

(AP Photo) The US military has deployed an anti-ship missile launcher for the first time on Batan Island in the Philippines, as Marines unloaded the high-precision weapon on the northern tip of the archipelago, just a sea border away from Taiwan. US and Philippine forces separately unleashed a barrage of missile and artillery fire that shot down several drones acting as hostile aircraft in live-fire drills on Sunday in Zambales province facing the disputed South China Sea. They were also staged near major geopolitical hotspots, which have become delicate frontlines in the regional rivalry between China and the US under former President Joe Biden and now Donald Trump. About 9,000 American and 5,000 Filipino military personnel took part in the combat maneuvers. At least 260 Australian personnel also joined, with smaller observer delegations from Japan and other countries. China has fiercely opposed the combat drills as provocative. Its aircraft carrier group sailed by a few days earlier near Batanes, where the US military had deployed the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System on Saturday on Batan near the Bashi Channel just south of Taiwan, a critical trade and military route that the US and Chinese militaries have tried to gain strategic control of. Michael Cederholm told a small group of journalists, including from The Associated Press, who were invited to witness the transport of the missile system aboard a C-130 Air Force aircraft to Batanes. \u201cWe\u2019re not here practicing a war plan,\u201d said Cederholm. \u201cWe\u2019re practicing for the defense of the Philippines.\u201d The US and the Philippines have denied the annual combat maneuvers \u2014 which both said would focus on a \u201cfull-scale battle scenario\u201d this year \u2014 were aimed at China or any adversary. Additionally, China had repeatedly expressed its strong opposition to the US Army deployment last year of a mid-range missile system in the Philippines for joint exercises. The US Army launcher with at least 16 Standard Missile-6 and the Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles was repositioned in January from an international airport in northern Laoag city to a northwestern coastal area facing the Scarborough Shoal, where China\u2019s forces have used water cannons and dangerous blocking maneuvers against Philippine coast guard and fishery ships and fired flares near Manila\u2019s patrol planes, a Philippine official then told The AP. Tomahawk missiles can travel over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), which places China within their target range. During the combat exercises from April 21 to May 9, American and Filipino forces will also practice jointly defending Philippine islands by repelling hostile forces attempting to assault from the sea in the western Philippine province of Palawan, which faces the South China Sea, and in northern Cagayan province near Batanes. Philippine Brig. Gen. Michael Logico said the combat exercises were crucial to strengthening deterrence against aggression in the Bashi Channel. Early this month, the Chinese military staged largescale drills in the waters around Taiwan and renewed a warning to the self-ruled democracy not to seek independence. Chinese navy, air, ground and rocket forces staged the drills. The Philippines used to host two of the largest US Navy and Air Force bases outside the American mainland.

Faustin Nsabumukunzi, 65, was charged with hiding from US authorities his role as a local leader in Rwanda when the genocide began in 1994. An estimated 800,000 Tutsis were killed during the three-month-long genocide. The indictment of the Bridgehampton man was unsealed in Central Islip on Long Island. Sugar said Nsabumukunzi was rightfully granted refugee status and lawful permanent residence and planned to \u201cfight these 30-year-old allegations\u201d while maintaining his innocence. In a detention memo seeking detention, prosecutors said interviews of witnesses who knew him in Rwanda indicated that Nsabumukunzi falsely assured Tutsis at public meetings when the genocide began that they would be protected. According to the indictment, Nsabumukunzi was sentenced to life in prison after he was convicted on genocide charges in absentia by a Rwandan court. He\u2019d been accused of using his leadership position to oversee the killings of Tutsis in his local area. He allegedly set up roadblocks during the genocide to detain and kill Tutsis and participated in killings, the indictment says. In 2003, Nsabumukunzi applied to settle in the US as a refugee and received a green card in 2007 before applying for citizenship in 2009 and 2015, authorities said. In his applications, they added, he falsely asserted that he was not involved in the genocide. Matthew R. Galeotti, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, said in a release that Nsabumukunzi participated in \u201cheinous acts of violence abroad and then lied his way into a green card and tried to obtain US citizenship.\u201d"

The case stemmed from the Operation Car Wash, a sweeping corruption probe that has implicated top politicians and businesspeople across Latin America \u2014 including current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who was arrested in 2018 and imprisoned for nearly two years. Collor, 75, was the first Brazilian president elected by popular vote, in 1989, after a 21-year military dictatorship. He was impeached and removed from office by Congress in 1992 following corruption allegations. In 2007, he was elected as a senator representing his home state of Alagoas in northeastern Brazil. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered the former president\u2019s arrest Thursday, with the full board set to vote on Friday whether to confirm the decision. De Moraes said in his decision that Collor should begin serving his sentence, noting that the former president\u2019s lawyers have attempted to drag out proceedings through appeals."

(Source: AP) US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order aimed at boosting the deep-sea mining industry, marking his latest attempt to boost US access to nickel, copper and other critical minerals used widely across the economy. The order, which Trump signed in private, seeks to jumpstart the mining of both US and international waters as part of a push to offset China\u2019s sweeping control of the critical minerals industry. \u201cThe United States has a core national security and economic interest in maintaining leadership in deep-sea science and technology and seabed mineral resources,\u201d Trump said in the order. The order directs the administration to expedite mining permits under the Deep Seabed Hard Minerals Resource Act of 1980 and to establish a process for issuing permits along the US Outer Continental Shelf. It also orders the expedited review of seabed mining permits \u201cin areas beyond the national jurisdiction,\u201d a move likely to spark friction with the international community. Any country can allow deep-sea mining in its own territorial waters, roughly up to 200 nautical miles from shore, and companies are already lining up to mine US waters. Impossible Metals earlier this month asked the administration to launch a commercial auction for access to deposits of nickel, cobalt and other critical minerals off the coast of American Samoa. Shares of The Metals Company \u2013 among the most prominent of deep-sea mining companies \u2013 rose on Thursday by roughly 40% to hit a 52-week high of $3.39 per share after the Reuters report earlier in the day on the executive order. Last week, Trump officials fast-tracked permitting on 10 mining projects across the United States and implemented an abbreviated approval process for mining projects on federal lands. The administration also said it would approve one of the country\u2019s largest copper mines."

The Rapid Support Forces and allied militias launched an offensive on el-Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur province, on Sunday, the Resistance Committees in the city said. Dozens of other people were wounded in the attack, said the group, which tracks the war. There was no immediate comment from the RSF. El-Fasher, more than 800 kilometers (500 miles) southwest of the capital, Khartoum, is under the control of the military, which has fought the RSF since Sudan descended into civil war more than two years ago, killing more than than 24,000 people, according to the United Nations, though activists say the number is likely far higher. The RSF has been attempting to seize el-Fasher for a year to complete its control of the entire Darfur region. Since then, it has launched many attacks on the city and two major famine-hit camps for displaced people on its outskirts. The city is now estimated to be home to more than 1 million people, many of whom have been displaced by the ongoing war and previous bouts of violence in Darfur. The RSF grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militias, mobilized two decades ago by then-president Omar al-Bashir against populations that identify as Central or East African in Darfur. The Janjaweed were accused of mass killings, rapes and other atrocities.The attacks on el-Fasher have intensified in recent months as the RSF suffered battlefield setbacks in Khartoum and other urban areas in the county\u2019s east and center. Sunday\u2019s attack came less than a week after a two-day attack by the RSF and its allied militias on the city and the Zamzam and Abu Shouk camps killed more than 400 people, according to the United Nations. Last week\u2019s attack forced up to 400,000 people to flee the Zamzam camp, Sudan\u2019s largest, which has become inaccessible to aid workers, said U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric."

The International Pentecost Holiness Church said mass weddings are part of its Easter festivities and the tradition of polygamy, which is observed in some African cultures, has been incorporated into the church. Sunday\u2019s ceremonies would see some men marry their sixth or seventh wives, church spokesperson Vusi Ndala said. Other grooms were set to marry multiple brides at one time, Ndala said.

It is an African-initiated church, meaning it was founded by Africans rather than foreign missionaries, and blends Pentecostal beliefs with local traditions. The church has held mass weddings before, including in 2023 when around 400 couples or bridal parties tied the knot. It says this year\u2019s event was its largest by far.

(AP) The weddings were held at the church\u2019s headquarters, a huge, dome-shaped building in the town of Heidelberg, near Johannesburg, that can seat 60,000 people. The congregants who were being married waited in long white tents set up in open fields next to the church building, where they were given bridal flowers, food packs and water. They then filed into the church building in long queues, the women wearing white bridal gowns and many of the men in matching white suits and red ties. Polygamy is legal in South Africa if the union is registered as a customary marriage."

Somali forces have recaptured the villages briefly seized last month, but al Shabaab has continued to advance in the countryside, leading the government to deploy police and prison guards to support the military, soldiers have told Reuters."

He met Wednesday night with Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, writing on the social platform X after the meeting: \u201cCooperation with (the IAEA) is indispensable to provide credible assurances about the peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme at a time when diplomacy is urgently needed.\u201d Iran\u2019s state-run IRNA news agency described Araghchi as briefing Grossi on the first round of talks with the US, while also urging the IAEA to \u201cadopt a clear and transparent stance regarding threats against Iran\u2019s peaceful nuclear facilities.\u201d Both Israel and the US have threatened to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear sites if a deal can\u2019t be reached to limit Tehran\u2019s programme. \u201cAs variety of spoilers are gathered to derail current negotiations, we need a Director General of Peace,\u201d Araghchi wrote on X. \u201cOur predisposition is to trust Grossi in mission to keep the Agency away from politics and politicization, and to retain focus on its technical mandate.\u201d Since the nuclear deal\u2019s collapse in 2018 with Trump\u2019s unilateral withdraw of the US from the accord, Iran has abandoned all limits on its programme, and enriches uranium to up to 60 per cent purity \u2014 near weapons-grade levels of 90 per cent. Surveillance cameras installed by the IAEA have been disrupted, while Iran has barred some of the Vienna-based agency\u2019s most experienced inspectors. Iranian officials also have increasingly threatened that they could pursue atomic weapons, something the West and the IAEA have been worried about for years since Tehran abandoned an organised weapons programme in 2003. Any possible deal between Iran and the US likely would need to rely on the IAEA\u2019s expertise to ensure Tehran\u2019s compliance. And despite tensions between Iran and the agency, its access has not been entirely revoked. Iran\u2019s foreign minister questions contradictory responses from US envoy Meanwhile, Araghchi on Wednesday warned the US about taking contradictory stances in the talks. That likely refers to comments from US Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, who this week initially suggested a deal could see Iran go back to 3.67 per cent uranium enrichment \u2014 like in the 2015 deal reached by the Obama administration. Witkoff then followed up with saying \u201ca deal with Iran will only be completed if it is a Trump deal.\u201d \u201cIran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cIt is imperative for the world that we create a tough, fair deal that will endure, and that is what President Trump has asked me to do.\u201d Araghchi warned America about taking any \u201ccontradictory and opposing stances\u201d in the talks."

            "text": "Trump's choice to get directly involved in negotiations points to his desire to quickly finalize a slew of trade deals as China is pursuing its own set of agreements. (Source: File) President Donald Trump on Wednesday inserted himself directly into trade talks with Japanese officials, a sign of the high stakes for the United States after its tariffs rattled the economy and caused the administration to assure the public that it would quickly reach deals. \u201cHopefully something can be worked out which is good (GREAT!) for Japan and the USA!\u201d Trump wrote in a social media post ahead of the meeting. Afterward, he posted: \u201cA Great Honor to have just met with the Japanese Delegation on Trade. Big Progress!\u201d Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told reporters Thursday in Tokyo that his chief trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, told him from Washington that the talks were \u201cvery candid and constructive.\u201d Trump\u2019s choice to get directly involved in negotiations points to his desire to quickly finalize a slew of trade deals as China is pursuing its own set of agreements. It\u2019s an open test of Trump\u2019s reputation as a dealmaker as countries around the world seek to limit the potential damage unleashed by his import taxes. The sweeping tariffs that Trump announced on April 2 triggered panic in the financial markets and generated recession fears, causing the U.S. president to quickly put a partial 90-day hold on the import taxes and increase his already steep tariffs against China to as much as 145%. The pause temporarily spared Japan from 24% across-the-board tariffs, but there continues to be a 10% baseline tariff and a 25% tax on imported cars, auto parts, steel and aluminum exports. With Japan charging an average tax rate of 1.9% on other countries\u2019 goods and having a longstanding alliance with the U.S., the talks on Wednesday are a crucial indicator of whether the Trump administration can achieve a meaningful deal that reassures the markets, American voters and foreign allies. U.S. economic rival China, meanwhile, is trying to capitalize on the turmoil around Trump\u2019s announcements, with its leader, President Xi Jinping, touring nations of Southeast Asia and promoting his country as a more reliable trade partner. Japan is among the first countries to start open negotiations with the U.S. Trump and other administration officials have said the phones have been \u201cringing off the hook\u201d with dozens of countries calling, eager to strike deals with a president who views himself as a master negotiator to avoid tariffs when the 90-day pause ends. Israel and Vietnam have offered to zero out their tariff rates, but Trump has been noncommittal as to whether that would be sufficient. On Thursday, Trump is scheduled to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who will likely be carrying messages on behalf of the European Union about how to resolve the tariffs Trump placed on the 27-state group. Still, the U.S. president may also be feeling increased domestic pressures to settle any tariffs as many voters say they returned Trump to the White House with the specific goal of improving the economy. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that Trump\u2019s tariff policies would hurt the U.S. economy, a direct warning to a White House trying to sell the import taxes as a long-term positive for the country. Japan, like many other nations trying to minimize the possible economic fallout from Trump\u2019s tariffs, has been scrambling to respond. It has set up a special task force to assess the impact of the tariffs and offer loans to anxious companies. Nor has the administration been transparent about its asks. The Trump administration is seeking to close the $68.5 billion trade deficit with Japan and seeking greater access for U.S. goods in foreign markets, yet the president has also insisted that tariff revenues can be used to pay down the federal budget deficit. \u201cJapan is coming in today to negotiate Tariffs, the cost of military support, and \u2018TRADE FAIRNESS,\u2019\u201d Trump posted Wednesday. Japan has contended that Trump\u2019s tariff measures are likely to violate bilateral trade agreements or World Trade Organization rules. While Ishiba has said he opposes retaliatory tariffs, he also has said he is in no rush to push for a settlement because he doesn\u2019t want concessions. Xi is touring Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this week on a trip that likely was planned before the tariffs\u2019 uncertainty but that he\u2019s also using to promote Beijing as a source of stability in the region and shore up relationships in that part of the world as he looks for ways to mitigate the 145% tariffs that Trump is keeping on China. In Washington, Trump has indicated that he also wants to discuss how much the Japanese contribute to the cost of U.S. troops stationed there, largely as a deterrent to China. Trump\u2019s demand for more defense spending concerns the Japanese government."

(South Korea Air Force via AP) North Korea on Thursday threatened unspecified retaliation after the US flew long-range bombers over South Korea during training with South Korean warplanes, which North Korea views as practice for an attack against it. The US flew the B-1B bombers Tuesday to train with other US and South Korean fighter jets. South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry had said the drill was meant to show the two countries\u2019 combined deterrence capability against North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear program. The U.S. and South Korea routinely hold joint military exercises that they describe as defensive in nature. But North Korea regards them as an invasion rehearsal and is particularly sensitive to the U.S. mobilization of strategic assets such as long-range bombers, aircraft carriers and nuclear-powered submarines. \u201cThe recent military move of the U.S. and the ROK is an open threat to the security of our state and a grave provocation that raises the military tension in the region to an extreme dangerous level,\u201d an unidentified spokesperson for North Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry said in a statement carried in state media.

In a development that could further anger North Korea, South Korea\u2019s air force announced later Thursday that it was beginning its large-scale biannual aerial exercise with U.S. forces from Thursday. The air force said the two-week \u201cFreedom Flag\u201d exercise would involve 90 aircraft and other aerial assets from South Korea and the U.S. Animosities on the Korean Peninsula are running high as North Korea continues weapons tests designed to modernize his nuclear arsenal and supports Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine by supplying weapons and troops."

China faces 145% taxes on exports to the US, while other countries were given a 90-day reprieve for most duties. It wasn\u2019t clear why China was changing negotiators but the change comes as Chinese officials say the country has multiple options to respond to U.S. actions, including relying more on its own vast market of 1.4 billion consumers, and on Europe and countries in the global south.

            "title": "White House starting new media policy to restrict wire services\u2019 access to president",
            "text": "Fresh from a courtroom loss over The Associated Press\u2019 access to the presidency, the White House on Tuesday put forward a new media policy that sharply curtails access to Donald Trump by news agencies that serve media outlets around the world. It was the latest attempt by the new administration to control coverage of its activities. The move would block the AP and other wire services that serve billions of readers through thousands of news outlets. It comes after a judge ruled the White House had violated the organization\u2019s free speech by banning it because it disagreed with the outlet\u2019s decision not to rename the Gulf of Mexico. While outlining a new \u201cpool coverage\u201d policy for small spaces like the Oval Office and Air Force One, the White House also said it will ultimately give press secretary Karoline Leavitt the final say over who gets to question her boss, according to people who have seen the plan. A day after defying McFadden\u2019s ruling and continuing AP\u2019s ban when Trump and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele met with reporters in the Oval Office, the White House leaked a new policy to selected journalists. The White House now says it will lump the three wire services with print reporters for two slots \u2014 meaning roughly three dozen reporters will rotate for two regular slots. Wire services typically report and write stories that are used in multiple locations around the country and the planet. Even with the rotation, the White House said Trump\u2019s press secretary \u201cshall retain day-to-day discretion to determine composition of the pool.\u201d The new policy says reporters will also be allowed in \u201cirrespective of the substantive viewpoint expressed by an outlet.\u201d In a statement, the AP\u2019s Lauren Easton said the outlet was deeply disappointed that rather than restore the AP\u2019s access, the White House instead chose restrictions over all of the wire services. Under Leavitt, the White House has given greater access to news outlets friendly to Trump. That was visible Tuesday, when the first reporter Leavitt addressed during a briefing asked two questions while also praising Trump policy. Despite the occasional fireworks, Trump has made himself accessible to the media more than his predecessor, former President Joe Biden. Cramped-quarters events, particularly in the Oval Office, are some of his favorite places to talk \u2014 rendering the new access policy all the more impactful. The new policy advanced on Tuesday did not address access for photographers. At an earlier court hearing about the AP\u2019s case, the outlet\u2019s chief White House photographer, Evan Vucci, and correspondent Zeke Miller testified about how the ban has hurt the business of a news agency built to quickly get news and images to its customers. The White House has argued that press access to the president is a privilege, not a right, that it should control \u2014 much like it decides to whom Trump gives one-on-one interviews. In court papers filed last weekend, his lawyers signaled that even with McFadden\u2019s decision, the AP\u2019s days of unchallenged access to open presidential events were over."

            "text": "At least 600 students at more than 90 colleges and universities have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated in recent weeks. (AP) At first, the bar association for immigration attorneys began receiving inquiries from a couple students a day. These were foreigners studying in the US, and they\u2019d discovered in early April their legal status had been terminated with little notice. To their knowledge, none of the students had committed a deportable offense. In recent days, the calls have begun flooding in. Hundreds of students have been calling to say they have lost legal status, seeking advice on what to do next. \u201cWe thought it was going to be something that was unusual,\u201d said Matthew Maiona, a Boston-based immigration attorney who is getting about six calls a day from panicked international students. \u201cBut it seems now like it\u2019s coming pretty fast and furious.\u201d The speed and scope of the federal government\u2019s efforts to terminate the legal status of international students have stunned colleges across the country. Few corners of higher education have been untouched, as schools ranging from prestigious private universities, large public research institutions and tiny liberal arts colleges discover status terminations one after another among their students. At least 600 students at more than 90 colleges and universities have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated in recent weeks, according to an Associated Press review of university statements and correspondence with school officials. Advocacy groups collecting reports from colleges say hundreds more students could be caught up in the crackdown. Students apparently targeted over minor infractions Around 1.1 million international students were in the United States last year \u2014 a source of essential revenue for tuition-driven colleges. International students are not eligible for federal financial aid, and their ability to pay tuition often factors into whether they will be admitted to American schools. Often, they pay full price. Many of the students losing their legal status are from India and China, which together account for more than half the international students at American colleges. But the terminations have not been limited to those from any one part of the world, lawyers said. Four students from two Michigan universities are suing Trump administration officials after their F-1 student status was terminated last week. Their attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, Ramis Wadood, said the students never received a clear reason why. \u201cWe don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s the scary part,\u201d he said. The students were informed of the terminations by their universities via email, which came as a shock, Wadood said. The reason given was that there was a \u201ccriminal records check and/or that their visa was revoked,\u201d Wadood said, but none of them were charged or convicted of crimes. Some had either speeding or parking tickets, but one didn\u2019t have any, he said. Only one of the students had known their entry visa was revoked, Wadood said. In New Hampshire, a federal judge last week granted a temporary restraining order to restore the status of a Ph.D. student at Dartmouth College, Xiaotian Liu, while he challenges the revocation of his visa. In a break from past, feds cancel students\u2019 status directly At many colleges, officials learned the legal immigration status of some international students had been terminated when staff checked a database managed by the Department of Homeland Security. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school. The system to track enrollment and movements of international students came under the control of Immigration and Customs Enforcement after 9/11, said Fanta Aw, CEO of NAFSA, an association of international educators. She said recent developments have left students fearful of how quickly they can be on the wrong side of enforcement. \u201cYou don\u2019t need more than a small number to create fear,\u201d Aw said. \u201cThere\u2019s no clarity of what are the reasons and how far the reach of this is.\u201d Her group says as many as 1,300 students have lost visas or had their status terminated, based on reports from colleges. Foreigners who are subject to removal proceedings are usually sent a notice to appear in immigration court on a certain date, but lawyers say affected students have not received any notices, leaving them unsure of next steps to take. Some schools have told students to leave the country to avoid the risk of being detained or deported. But some students have appealed the terminations and stayed in the United States while those are processed. A Ph.D. student from China at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill said she has begun carrying around her passport and immigration paperwork at the advice of the university\u2019s international student office. The student, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities, said she has been distressed to see the terminations even for students like her without criminal records."

The attacks launched by Sudan\u2019s notorious paramilitary group on two famine-hit camps for displaced people in North Darfur and its nearby capital on Friday and Saturday were initially reported to have left more than 100 dead, including 20 children and nine aid workers, according to a U.N. official. But the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, known as OCHA, reported the much higher death toll Monday, citing local sources that were not identified. The Associated Press could not independently verify the numbers due to the conditions and communications on the ground. Sudan plunged into conflict on April 15, 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including the vast western Darfur region. Since then, at least 24,000 people have been tallied as being killed, according to the United Nations, though activists say the number is far higher.

North Darfur is one of five states in the Darfur region. \u201cPreliminary figures from local sources indicate that more than 300 civilians have been killed, including 10 humanitarian personnel from the NGO Relief International who lost their lives while operating one of the last functioning health centers in Zamzam camp,\u201d Dujarric said. Also Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council has scheduled emergency closed consultations on Sudan. Also Read | A year after fighting broke out in Sudan, what is the state of the conflict?

Mamadou Dian Balde, the U.N. refugee office\u2019s regional director, said in a video press conference with U.N. correspondents that \u201cmassive violations of human rights\u201d have forced almost 13 million Sudanese to flee their homes, including 4 million who fled to other countries. Most fled to Sudan\u2019s immediate neighbors, but more than 200,000 have gone to Libya and about 70,000 to Uganda, he said."

Trump on Monday insisted these would just be \u201cviolent people,\u201d implying they would be those already convicted of crimes in the United States, though he\u2019s also floated it as a punishment for those who attack Tesla dealerships to protest his administration and its patron, billionaire Elon Musk. But it would likely be a violation of the U.S. Constitution for his administration to send any native-born citizen forcibly into an overseas prison. Indeed, it would likely even violate a provision of a law Trump himself signed during his first term.

(AP Photo/Nathan Howard) Here\u2019s a look at the notion of sending U.S. citizens to prison in a foreign country, why it\u2019s likely not legal and some possible legal loopholes. Immigrants can be removed, and that\u2019s what\u2019s been happening in El Salvador. The country is taking both its own citizens that the United States is sending as well as those from Venezuela and potentially other countries that will not take their own citizens back from the U.S. The Venezuelans sent there last month had no opportunity to respond to evidence against them or appear before a judge. That\u2019s the deal the Trump administration signed with Bukele. The U.S. has sent people to El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama and elsewhere even when they are not citizens of those countries. Bukele calls himself \u201cthe world\u2019s coolest dictator\u201d and has cracked down on human rights during his administration. He\u2019s also turned El Salvador from one of the world\u2019s most violent countries into a fairly safe one. Trump has embraced that example, including during the Oval Office visit Monday. Sending immigrants from countries like Venezuela to El Salvador sends a message to would-be migrants elsewhere about the risks of trying to make it to \u2014 or stay in \u2014 the United States. There\u2019s a second benefit to the administration: People sent to El Salvador are outside the jurisdiction of United States courts. Judges, the administration argues, can\u2019t order someone sent to El Salvador to be released or shipped back to the U.S. because the U.S. government no longer has control of them. It\u2019s a potential legal loophole that led Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor to issue a grim warning in her opinion in a 9-0 U.S. Supreme Court finding that the administration could not fly alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador with no court hearing, even after Trump invoked an 18th century law last used during World War II to claim wartime powers. Also Read | El Salvador president says Maryland man wrongfully deported will not be returned to US in meeting with Trump A second case highlights the risks of sending people to El Salvador. The administration admits it sent a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, erroneously to El Salvador. A Salvadoran immigrant, Abrego Garcia, who has not been charged with a crime, had an order against deportation but was shipped to CECOT anyway. On Monday Bukele and Trump scoffed at the idea of sending him back, even though the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the administration to \u201cfacilitate\u201d his return. The United States does have extradition treaties with several countries where it will send a citizen accused of a crime in that country to face trial there. That appears to be the only existing way a U.S. citizen can be forcibly removed from the country under current law. She noted that even if the administration tries to transfer federal prisoners there, arguing they\u2019re already incarcerated, it could run afoul of the First Step Act that Trump himself championed and signed in 2018. There is one potential loophole that the administration could use to send a small group of citizens to El Salvador. They can try to strip the citizenship of people who earned it after immigrating to the United States."

            "text": "A man wearing a mask of President Yoon Suk Yeol celebrates along with others after Yoon was removed from office, near royal palace in downtown Seoul, South Korea. (AP photo) Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s legal saga is far from over. Ten days after he was ousted from office over his martial law declaration, the former conservative South Korean president appeared for the first time at his criminal trial Monday on high-stakes rebellion charges. Yoon\u2019s decision to declare military rule and send troops to Seoul streets in December made him the country\u2019s first president to be indicted while in office. If convicted of rebellion, he could face a life sentence, or theoretically, the death penalty. When the Constitutional Court upheld the parliament\u2019s impeachment of Yoon and removed him from office, it stated Yoon\u2019s violation of the constitution and other laws was too grave to be tolerated and \u201cbetrayed public confidence.\u201d It said Yoon\u2019s martial law enactment \u201ccaused confusion in the society, economy, politics, diplomacy and all other areas.\u201d Given the ruling, there is \u201ca low possibility\u201d for the criminal court to issue a different verdict so Yoon will likely be convicted on rebellion charges, said Park SungBae, a lawyer who specializes in criminal law. The letters read \u2018Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s immediate dismissal.\u2019 (AP photo) The Seoul Central District Court is currently reviewing whether Yoon\u2019s martial law imposition amounted to an act of masterminding a rebellion, a grave charge whose conviction carries only two sentences \u2014 the capital punishment or life imprisonment. Yoon has denied the rebellion charges brought by prosecutors in January. Yoon maintained his decree was a desperate yet peaceful attempt to raise public awareness about how the \u201canti-state\u201d liberal opposition was allegedly abusing its legislative majority to obstruct his agenda and complicate state affairs. \u201cThe fact that they built a rebellion charge over an event that lasted only a few hours and was resolved non-violently after the National Assembly\u2019s demand to lift the measures was immediately accepted \u2026 doesn\u2019t align with proper legal reasoning,\u201d Yoon said Monday at the court, according to Yonhap news agency. Some observers earlier said Yoon\u2019s rebellion charges were debatable as his decree didn\u2019t lead to major violence or cause any serious civilian casualties. The main issue in Yoon\u2019s criminal trial is whether his deployment of hundreds of troops to the National Assembly and election commission offices constituted an illegal attempt to shut down those institutions. Also Read | South Korea\u2019s ousted leader Yoon due in court as criminal trial starts Yoon has defended his actions, saying he never attempted to paralyze the National Assembly and had always planned to accept the outcome if lawmakers voted to lift martial law \u2014 which they did just hours after its declaration. His claims contradict the testimonies of some military commanders, who say Yoon ordered them to drag lawmakers out of the chamber to prevent them from voting against his decree. The Seoul court will focus on \u201cdetermining whether there was an intent to undermine constitutional order, and individually assess a broad range of specific actions, including the circumstances under which the military and police forces were deployed,\u201d said Yang Hong-seok, a lawyer. Yoon\u2019s dismissal prompted a June 3 snap election to choose his successor, who will be given a full five-year term. Observes say Yoon will likely influence his People Power Party\u2019s selection of its presidential candidate, as he would want someone who can stand up for him and pardon him if he\u2019s convicted. In a public message last week, Yoon expressed gratitude to his supporters and stressed that he will \u201ccontinue to do my utmost\u201d to build the \u201cfree and prosperous Republic of Korea that we have dreamed of together.\u201d Yoon no longer enjoys presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions. Experts say prosecutors could subsequently charge him with abuse of power and other crimes related to his martial law decree. Park said Yoon\u2019s trial at the Seoul district court is expected to last one-two years as there are too many witnesses to question and too many documents to examine. Yang said he expects a verdict within a year, given how crucial the case is. Appeals can send Yoon\u2019s case to a higher court and then the Supreme Court, but their verdicts won\u2019t likely take more than a year altogether, Park said."

(Andres Martinez Casares/Pool Photo via AP) China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping started a week of diplomacy in Southeast Asia with a visit to Vietnam on Monday, signaling China\u2019s commitment to global trade, just after US President Donald Trump upended the global economy with his latest tariffs moves. Although Trump has paused some tariffs, China was the outlier, as he has kept in place 145% tariffs on the world\u2019s second-largest economy.

In Vietnam, Xi will meet with Vietnam\u2019s Communist Party General Secretary To Lam, as well as the Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh. \u201cThe trip to Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia is all about how China can really insulate itself against the from Trump,\u201d said Nguyen, pointing out that since Xi became the president of China in 2013, he has only visited Vietnam twice. This is his third visit and comes just a year after he last visited in December 2023. The timing of the visit sends a \u201cstrong political message that Southeast Asia is important to China,\u201d said Huong Le-Thu at the International Crisis Group. She said that given the severity of Trump\u2019s tariffs and despite the 90-day pause, Southeast Asian nations were anxious that the tariffs, if implemented, could complicate their development. \u201cXi\u2019s trip is to showcase how China is the opposite to the coercive and self-interested U.S. There will be a lot of expectations about what type of leadership and initiatives China is going to come up with at this time of crisis,\u201d she said.

Vietnam had been hit with 46% tariffs under Trump\u2019s order before the 90-day pause. After Vietnam, Xi is expected to go to Malaysia next and then Cambodia."

(File Photo) The leader of Hungary\u2019s largest opposition party on Sunday told thousands of supporters that he would guide his country out of its international isolation if he defeats Prime Minister Viktor Orban in elections scheduled for next year. Peter Magyar, the leader of the Respect and Freedom (Tisza) party, represents the most serious challenge to Orban\u2019s power since the right-wing populist leader took power in 2010. Recent polling suggests that Tisza has overtaken Orban\u2019s Fidesz party as Hungary struggles with a stagnating economy and has been politically sidelined in the European Union over Orban\u2019s policies. Speaking at a rally in Budapest on Sunday, Magyar said that, if elected, he and his party would restore Hungary\u2019s relationships and reputation among its allies that have suffered as Orban has attacked the European Union and pursued close relationships with autocracies like Russia and China. \u201cWe will finally put our common affairs in order,\u201d Magyar said. \u201cOur homeland, Hungary, will once again be a proud and reliable ally of NATO.

This system can only be replaced, and that is what we will do \u2014 lawfully, democratically, but with determination, we will cut down the regime.\u201d Nora Farkas, a supporter of Magyar at the rally, said she had hoped for Orban\u2019s defeat in Hungary\u2019s last national elections in 2022, but that with around a year to go before the next ballot, she is more confident that change is possible. \u201cAnyone who thinks things are going well in this country is blind.

(AP) Donald Trump\u2019s doctor says the oldest man to be elected president is \u201cfully fit\u201d to serve as commander in chief as the White House released results of the physical exam Trump had Friday. The 78-year-old Trump is 20 pounds lighter since his last exam as president in 2020 showed him bordering on obesity. His physician, Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, cited an \u201cactive lifestyle\u201d that \u201dcontinues to contribute significantly\u201d to the Republican president\u2019s well-being. Trump turns 79 on June 14. In a three-page summary of the comprehensive exam, the doctor said Trump is \u201cfully fit to execute the duties of Commander-in-Chief and Head of State.\u201d Trump weighed 224 at the checkup, down from 244 at that physical more than four years ago. In July 2024, according to the report, then-candidate Trump had a colonoscopy that found a benign polyp and the condition called diverticulosis. It\u2019s a common condition in which the walls of the intestine weaken with age. It can lead to inflammation, though most people with it never experience any problems. Barbabella wrote that Trump remains in \u201cexcellent health\u201d with \u201crobust\u201d cardiac, pulmonary, neurological and general physical function.\u201d The doctor said Trump\u2019s days include participating in multiple meetings, public appearances, media availabilities and \u201cfrequent victories in golf events.\u201d Trump is an avid golfer who said he recently won tournaments played at clubs he owns in Florida. Trump has a resting heart rate of 62 beats per minute, in line with previous tests. A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 beats to 100 beats per minute, and generally, a lower rate implies better cardiovascular fitness. Barbabella performed and supervised the medical examination of Trump and said it included diagnostic and laboratory testing in addition to consultations with 14 specialists Barbabella is also the third consecutive osteopathic doctor to serve as physician to the president, following Biden\u2019s doctor and one of the doctors who cared for Trump in his first term.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Trump receives standing ovation as he enters UFC event in Miami President Donald Trump entered to a standing ovation and cheers from a crowd of thousands attending a UFC event on Saturday night, shaking hands with supporters against a backdrop of fans waving his trademark MAGA hats. Just as Trump entered, he greeted podcast host Joe Rogan, who sat to the right of the president. Trump entered the arena with UFC President Dana White, with whom he has been close for decades. He was also accompanied by his granddaughter, Kai Trump, the daughter of Donald Trump Jr. Throughout the fight, the UFC jumbotron frequently featured the president, drawing roars from the sold-out arena. The crowd periodically cheered \u201cUSA,\u201d and Trump briefly danced to the Village People\u2019s \u201cYMCA\u201d standing from his seat, firing up the crowd. In between fights, Trump would occasionally shake hands with people who approached him and lean in to speak to Musk, who at times held his son on his shoulders. However, he mostly stayed seated, acknowledging and speaking to fighters who would go against the net to greet the president. The Republican president is a longtime UFC fan and sports enthusiast, who has frequently attended major fights. The mixed martial arts fight at Miami\u2019s Kaseya Centre was Trump\u2019s first UFC visit since he took office in January, and it came weeks after Trump attended the Saudi-sponsored LIV golf tournament at his golf club in Miami. In a further nod to his sports enthusiasm, Trump has also attended the Super Bowl and Daytona 500 since taking office. He sat cageside at a UFC championship fight in New York City last November, shortly after he won the 2024 election. It\u2019s the fourth UFC event in Miami, in a county that supported the president by about 11 percentage points in the November election. The president arrived in West Palm Beach on Friday for his 10th visit to South Florida since he became president, spending the evening in his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach. He flew to Miami after playing golf at his club in West Palm Beach. \u201cYou know who\u2019s going to win? Dana White. Dana White\u2019s gonna win,\u201d Trump told reporters Saturday night aboard Air Force One. His close affiliation with UFC helped boost his 2024 presidential campaign among young male voters prior to the November election, where he made promoting hypermasculine tones a signature of the campaign."

            "title": "New laws complicate Wyoming\u2019s abortion situation as bans set to be argued in state Supreme Court",
            "text": "When a Wyoming woman phoned the state\u2019s only abortion clinic recently to make an appointment to end her pregnancy, she received news that complicated her life even more. Wellspring Health Access had stopped providing abortions that same day, responding to a slew of new requirements for the Casper clinic to become a licensed surgical center. \u201cIt was kind of really bad timing on my part,\u201d said the woman, who declined to be named because of abortion\u2019s stigma in her community. Though abortion remains legal in Wyoming, it has become increasingly difficult because of new requirements for abortion clinics and women seeking abortions. In this case, the woman had to go to Colorado, which partially borders southern Wyoming. On Wednesday, the Wyoming Supreme Court is set to hear arguments over state abortion bans that a lower court judge has suspended and struck down as unconstitutional. But even if the state high court agrees with those rulings, access to abortion in Wyoming stands to remain uncertain. New state laws make getting abortions much harder One new law targets Wellspring Health Access as Wyoming\u2019s only abortion clinic, requiring licensure as an outpatient surgical center at a cost of up to $500,000 in renovations, according to the clinic. The law also requires the clinic\u2019s physicians to get admitting privileges at a hospital within 10 miles (16 kilometers). A hospital three blocks from the clinic is under no obligation to admit its doctors, however. \u201cThis is an abortion ban without banning abortion,\u201d said Julie Burkhart, founder and president of Wellspring Health Access. A second new law requires women to get ultrasounds at least 48 hours before a medication abortion, costing them $250 or more plus gas money and travel time in a state where ultrasounds are unavailable in many rural areas. The Wyoming Legislature is well within its rights to regulate abortion to protect women from even the small chance of an abortion mishap, argued an attorney for the state, John Woykovsky, at a recent court hearing on the new laws. Unsettled abortion laws have far-reaching effects In most cases, a transvaginal ultrasound is required to obtain a fetal image in the earliest stages of pregnancy, when most abortions are done. That invasiveness, especially for victims of rape and abuse, caused Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican, to veto the ultrasound bill a few days after he signed the surgical center requirement into law Feb. 27. The Republican-dominated Legislature overrode his veto, leading Wellspring Health Access, the Wyoming abortion access advocate Chelsea\u2019s Fund and others to sue over it and the licensing law. Several dozen abortion opponents attended a Tuesday hearing in Casper on whether to suspend the laws while the lawsuit moves ahead. If that happens, clinic abortions will resume, to the dismay of opponents, said Ross Schriftman, president of the local Wyoming Right to Life chapter. \u201cNo inspections, no confirmation of whether the people committing the abortions are licensed doctors for Wyoming and no continuity of care to the hospital,\u201d Schriftman said by email. Abortion proponents claim support among Wyoming women A former Wyoming resident who, in 2017, got an abortion in neighboring Colorado, her closest option at the time, sympathized with rural Wyoming women seeking abortions now. \u201cGod forbid it\u2019s the winter,\u201d said Ciel Newman, who now lives in New Mexico. \u201cWyoming\u2019s a huge, rural state without much interstate coverage.\u201d The amount of business at Wellspring Health Access shows that the lawmakers who passed the abortion laws are out of step with their constituents, Burkhart said. \u201cWe have had people coming in our doors each and every week that we\u2019ve been open,\u201d Burkhart said. \u201cIf people who come from Republican states, or more traditional-leaning states, didn\u2019t approve of abortion, we would go out of business because people just wouldn\u2019t show up.\u201d Is abortion access a Wyoming health care right? In the case about to be argued before the state Supreme Court, the same groups and women are suing over laws banning abortion that Wyoming has passed since 2022. They include the first explicit ban on medication abortions in the U.S. In November, a judge in Jackson ruled the bans violated a 2012 constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right of competent adults to make their own health care decisions. Even if the justices agree, Wellspring Health Access stands to suffer. Now, Wellspring Health Access doesn\u2019t offer abortions and sees about five patients a day, all of whom are transgender people receiving hormone replacement therapy, according to the clinic. Twenty-three other states, including 14 that have not totally banned abortion, have passed requirements similar to Wyoming\u2019s that opponents call \u201ctargeted regulation of abortion providers,\u201d or TRAP, laws. Surgical center licensing and hospital admitting privileges are typical requirements, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that advocates for abortion access. Few states have passed TRAP laws since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, but abortion remains an unsettled issue in several. A licensing law in Missouri stood to curtail abortions until it was blocked by a judge, pointed out Kimya Forouzan, state policy advisor for the Guttmacher Institute. \u201cThey still have a major impact on the ability to provide care,\u201d Forouzan said in an email. An even longer drive to get an abortion The Wyoming woman recently seeking a surgical abortion at Wellspring Health Access had to drive more than twice as far from her hometown, more than four hours each way, to have the procedure at the Planned Parenthood in Fort Collins, Colorado."

(Reuters) Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was transferred Saturday by medical aircraft from northeastern Brazil to the capital Brasilia after being hospitalized with abdominal pain a day earlier. Bolsonaro was hospitalized Friday morning while traveling in northeastern Brazil. The pain was caused by a bowel obstruction and was related to long-term effects of being stabbed in the abdomen in September 2018, his doctors said. Bolsonaro has been in and out of hospitals since the attack at a campaign event before Brazil\u2019s 2018 presidential election. The conservative leader underwent several surgeries during his presidency from 2019-2022. Bolsonaro also said he would likely undergo another surgery. Earlier on Saturday, doctors at Rio Grande Hospital in the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte told journalists he was stable and not in need of emergency surgery, said further procedures would depend on his recovery. Doctors also that the transfer to Brasilia was requested by his family and would happen Saturday afternoon. The far-right leader was admitted to a hospital in Santa Cruz, a small city in Rio Grande do Norte, and later transferred to a hospital in the state\u2019s capital, Natal. Bolsonaro was set to start a trip across the region to promote his party\u2019s right-wing agenda, eyeing next year\u2019s presidential election, though he himself is barred from running.

(Csaba Krizsan/MTI via AP) Authorities in several countries in Central Europe are working to contain an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease among cattle populations that has caused widespread border closures and required the killing of thousands of animals. The outbreak was first detected on a cattle farm in northwestern Hungary in early March, and animals on three farms in neighboring Slovakia tested positive for the highly transmissible virus two weeks later. Since then, animals from an additional three farms in Hungary and another three in Slovakia have tested positive for the virus, the first outbreak of the disease in either country in more than half a century. \u201cEverything is completely upside down\u201d in the area as farmers fear for their own herds and transportation is disrupted by border closures, said S\u00e1ndor Szoboszlai, a local entrepreneur and hunter in the Hungarian town of Lev\u00e9l where nearly 3,000 cattle had to be culled after the disease was discovered on a farm.

(AP Photo/Petr David Josek) Foot-and-mouth disease primarily affects cloven-hooved animals like cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and deer, and results in fevers and blisters in the mouth and hooves. The virus spreads through contact between animals, or on surfaces like clothing, skin and vehicles, or on the wind. It poses little danger to humans. On Friday, authorities in Hungary continued to conduct operations aimed at stopping the spread of the disease and disinfecting affected farms and vehicles in the area. Mats doused in a powerful disinfectant were placed at the entrances and exits of towns and villages across the region to eliminate virus molecules that may cling to tires \u2014 though many of those mats quickly went dry and were swept partially off the road by passing vehicles. This week, the Slovakian government, citing insufficient containment measures by Hungary, closed 16 of their common borders and one with Austria, all of them lesser-trafficked crossings so authorities can focus on conducting border checks at the major ones. Last week, Austria \u2014 where there have been no reported cases \u2014 closed 23 of its border crossings with Hungary and Slovakia. Authorities in the Czech Republic, relatively distant from the Hungarian and Slovakian farms where the disease has been detected, have introduced disinfection measures at all the five border crossings used by freight trucks entering the country. Jiri Cerny, associate professor at the Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague, said the most significant risk of transmission is \u201cthrough contaminated human objects\u201d such as \u201dtires and cars, on the soles of shoes, and through contaminated food.\u201d The Czech Agriculture Minister, Marek V\u00fdborn\u00fd, has said the restrictions could be lifted 30 days after the last farm animal infected with foot-and-mouth disease has been culled in Slovakia.

(Special Arrangement) In a move to boost the state\u2019s tourism and hospitality sector, the Bihar government has amended its Tourism Policy 2023, making it more investment-friendly and to promote employment opportunities for people with disabilities. The changes announced on March 21 this year aim to attract greater private investment in hotel infrastructure and broaden the scope of incentives available under the policy. Tourism Minister Raju Kumar Singh, while addressing a press conference, said the state has reduced the minimum investment requirement for availing benefits under the tourism policy. Investors can now set up three-star and two-star hotels to qualify for incentives, a shift from the earlier provision that mandated a minimum Rs 10 crore investment in four-star hotels. \u201cAfter discussions with stakeholders, we decided to make the policy more flexible. The new provisions will encourage investment in untapped tourist destinations across the state,\u201d Singh added. The policy also has a strong focus on employment generation. Hotels that employ locals will receive 100% ESI and EPF contributions or Rs 3,000 per employee per month, whichever is lower. Additionally, an incentive of Rs 1,500 per month will be provided for hiring disabled individuals from the state \u2014 a step that the government says reinforces its commitment to inclusive development and \u201cgrowth with justice.\u201d To further modernise Bihar\u2019s hospitality infrastructure, the government has floated Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for constructing hotels on three strategic sites \u2014 Hotel Patliputra Ashok, Bankipur Bus Stand, and Sultan Palace \u2014 under the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) mode. Tenders for these projects will be accepted until April 21, 2025.

Courts in Istanbul released on bail 127 defendants, most of them university students, who were arrested at their homes on March 24 after taking part in demonstrations sparked by the jailing of the city\u2019s opposition mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu. Imamoglu, who was arrested on March 19 on corruption and terrorism charges, is seen as the main challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s 22-year rule. His imprisonment has been widely viewed as politically motivated and sparked nationwide protests. The government insists Turkey\u2019s judiciary is independent and free of political influence. More than 2,000 people were detained for taking part in the country\u2019s largest mass demonstrations in more than a decade. Of those, some 300 were jailed awaiting trial. Those freed on Thursday are charged with participating in banned protests. One court released 102 suspects, many of them students with upcoming exams, after considering the time they had spent in prison, the low risk of absconding and on condition of not traveling abroad. A separate court released a further 25 people on condition that they report to police regularly. The releases follow a campaign by parents to have their children set free, with many holding daily vigils outside a prison in Silivri, west of Istanbul."

Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, led the liberal Democratic Party\u2019s campaign to oust the former president over his December declaration of martial law.

            "text": "The Trump administration has frozen over $1 billion in funding for Cornell University and $790 million for Northwestern University while it investigates both schools over civil rights violations, a U.S. official said on Tuesday. The funding being paused includes mostly grants and contracts with the federal departments of health, education, agriculture and defense, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The administration of US President Donald Trump has threatened to block federal funding for schools over pro-Palestinian campus protests as well as other issues such as diversity, equity and inclusion programs and transgender policies. Northwestern said it was aware of media reports about the funding freeze but had not received any official notification from the government and that it has cooperated in the investigation. \u201cFederal funds that Northwestern receives drive innovative and life-saving research, like the recent development by Northwestern researchers of the world\u2019s smallest pacemaker, and research fueling the fight against Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This type of research is now in jeopardy,\u201d a Northwestern spokesperson said. Trump has attempted to crack down on pro-Palestinian campus protests against U.S. ally Israel\u2019s devastating military assault on Gaza, which has caused a humanitarian crisis in the enclave and followed a deadly October 2023 attack by Islamist group Hamas.

Last month, the Trump administration canceled $400 million in funding for Columbia University, the epicenter of last year\u2019s pro-Palestinian campus protests. In March, the Trump administration suspended $175 million in funding to the University of Pennsylvania over its transgender sports policies."

(File Photo) President Donald Trump is expected to sign executive orders Tuesday aimed at boosting coal, a reliable but polluting energy source that\u2019s long been in decline. According to two senior White House officials, Trump will use his emergency authority to allow some older coal-fired power plants set for retirement to keep producing electricity to meet rising US power demand amid growth in data centers, artificial intelligence and electric cars. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue before the president\u2019s announcement, expected Tuesday afternoon. Trump, a Republican, has long promised to boost what he calls \u201cbeautiful\u201d coal to fire power plants and for other uses, but the industry has been in decline for decades.

The orders also will direct Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to \u201cacknowledge the end\u201d of an Obama-era moratorium that paused coal leasing on federal lands and require federal agencies to rescind policies transitioning the nation away from coal production.

            "text": "Safe havens the yen and the Swiss franc held near six-month highs on Tuesday while the US dollar nursed broad losses as financial markets grappled with mounting recession worries in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs. Currency markets were fragile but eerily calm in Asian trade after a volatile 24 hours where the dollar reversed heavy losses against the safe haven currencies as traders took stock of developments. Global shares have plummeted since Trump announced tariffs last week. China and the European Union swiftly hit back by proposing higher tariffs of their own, which Trump in turn threatened to fight with even higher duties. In currencies, investors have flocked to the Japanese yen and Swiss franc in the past week, seeking shelter from the market turmoil. The yen was last slightly stronger at 147.325 per US dollar, near the six-month high of 144.82 touched on Friday. The Swiss franc last fetched 0.85665 per dollar, also close to a six-month high touched in the previous session. While the dollar is typically known as a safe-haven asset, that status appears to be eroding as uncertainty over tariffs grows, stoking fears that U.S. growth could stutter. The dollar index, which measures the US currencies against six other units, was 0.44% lower on Tuesday. The index is down over 1% since the tariffs were announced. The risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars have dropped against their US counterpart in the past week but rose on Tuesday. The Aussie was 1% stronger at $0.6052, but stayed close to the five-year low it touched on Monday. The kiwi also rose 1% to $0.5606 ahead of a policy meeting on Wednesday, where New Zealand\u2019s central bank is expected to cut rates. In emerging markets, the Indonesian rupiah sank to a record low when markets resumed trading after a public holiday. James Athey, fixed income manager at Marlborough, said people are still hopeful that the most punitive tariffs can be negotiated down but noted that there are still downside risks."

            "text": "The Army has reenlisted more than 23 soldiers who were discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine, officials said Monday, rushing to implement President Donald Trump\u2019s order that troops be rehired and given back pay. Three people rejoined active duty Army service, and more than 20 came back either to the National Guard or the Reserve, the Army said. The soldiers have signed their contracts and were sworn in, and the active duty troops were reporting to their units, the Army said. Trump has argued that the vaccine mandate wrongly pushed troops out and suggested that many would return. In an executive order signed a week after he took office, Trump said the vaccine mandate cost the military \u201csome of our best people\u201d and he vowed to \u201crehire every patriot who was fired from the military with \u2026 backpay.\u201d The Pentagon made the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory in August 2021 for all service members, including those in the National Guard and Reserve. Then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said getting the vaccine was critical to maintaining a healthy, ready force. The Pentagon dropped the mandate in January 2023. The initial reenlistments come as the Pentagon last week formally increased the new minimum service commitment from two to four years for those discharged for refusing a lawful order to take the vaccine. The Army said the bulk of the soldiers who reenlisted were those ordered out for refusing the shot, and they signed on for four years. They will be entitled to get some back pay. Several, however, left the Army voluntarily to avoid the shot, so they are allowed to reenlist for two years and will not get back pay. Roughly 8,200 troops were discharged for refusing to obey the vaccine order. They have been allowed to rejoin since 2023, but that did not include any back pay. Just 113 reenlisted. According to Army spokesman Christopher Surridge, about 400 soldiers have inquired so far about the reenlistment program. Of those, about 100 are in the application process. The Army did not have estimates on how much it has given the soldiers in total back pay. The limited interest reflects what service leaders said early on, which was that many troops used the vaccine as a reason to leave and have moved on with their lives. Everyone who wants to reenlist must meet all military standards, including health, fitness and moral requirements. Service members have until Feb. 28, 2026, to seek reinstatement."

            "text": "Under the order issued on April 2, CBP personnel at all US ports of entry are required to detain sea salt products sourced from the farm. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock) The United States has blocked imports of sea salt products from a major South Korean salt farm accused of using slave labor, becoming the first trade partner to take punitive action against a decadeslong problem on salt farms in remote islands off South Korea\u2019s southwest coast. US Customs and Border Protection issued a withhold release order against the Taepyung salt farm, saying information \u201creasonably indicates\u201d the use of forced labor at the company in the island county of Sinan, where most of South Korea\u2019s sea salt products are made. Under the order issued on April 2, CBP personnel at all US ports of entry are required to detain sea salt products sourced from the farm. Taepyung is the largest salt farm in Sinan, reportedly producing about 16,000 tons of salt annually, which accounts for approximately 6% of the country\u2019s total output, and is a major supplier to South Korean food companies. The farm, located on Jeungdo island in Sinan and leasing most of its salt fields to tenants, has been repeatedly accused of using forced labour, including in 2014 and 2021. CBP said it identified several signs of forced labor during its investigation of Taepyung, including \u201cabuse of vulnerability, deception, restriction of movement, retention of identity documents, abusive living and working conditions, intimidation and threats, physical violence, debt bondage, withholding of wages, and excessive overtime.\u201d Lawyer Choi Jung Kyu, part of a group of attorneys and activists who petitioned CBP to take action against Taepyung and other South Korean salt farms in 2022, expressed hope that the US export ban would increase pressure on South Korea to take more effective steps to eliminate the slavery. \u201cSince the exposure of the problem in 2014, the courts have recognized the legal responsibility of the national government and local governments, but forced labor among salt farm workers has not been eradicated,\u201d Choi said. \u201cOur hope is that the export ban would force companies to strengthen due diligence over supply chains and lead to the elimination of human rights violations.\u201d Most of the salt farm slaves rescued in 2014 had been lured to the islands by \u201cman hunters\u201d and job brokers hired by salt farm owners, who would beat them into long hours of hard labour and confine them at their houses for years while providing little or no pay. In 2019, South Korea\u2019s Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling that ordered the government to compensate three men who had been enslaved on Sinan\u2019s salt farms, acknowledging that local officials and police failed to properly monitor their living and working conditions. The salt farm slavery issue resurfaced in 2021 when around a dozen workers at Taepyung were discovered to have endured various labour abuses, including forced labour and delayed payments."

            "title": "Iran-backed militias in Iraq ready to disarm to avert Trump wrath",
            "text": "Several powerful Iranian-backed militia groups in Iraq are prepared to disarm for the first time to avert the threat of an escalating conflict with the U.S. Trump administration, 10 senior commanders and Iraqi officials told Reuters. The move to defuse tensions follows repeated warnings issued privately by U.S. officials to the Iraqi government since Trump took power in January, according to the sources who include six local commanders of four major militias. The officials told Baghdad that unless it acted to disband the militias operating on its soil, America could target the groups with airstrikes, the people added. Izzat al-Shahbndar, a senior Shi\u2019ite Muslim politician close to Iraq\u2019s governing alliance, told Reuters that discussions between Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and several militia leaders were \u201cvery advanced\u201d, and the groups were inclined to comply with U.S. calls for disarmament. \u201cTrump is ready to take the war with us to worse levels, we know that, and we want to avoid such a bad scenario,\u201d said a commander of Kataib Hezbollah, the most powerful Shi\u2019ite militia, who spoke from behind a black face mask and sunglasses. The commanders said their main ally and patron, Iran\u2019s elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) military force, had given them its blessing to take whatever decisions they deemed necessary to avoid being drawn into a potentially ruinous conflict with the United States and Israel. The militias are part of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of about 10 hardline Shi\u2019ite armed factions that collectively command about 50,000 fighters and arsenals that include long-range missiles and anti-aircraft weapons, according to two security officials who monitor militias\u2019 activities. The Resistance group, a key pillar of Iran\u2019s network of regional proxy forces, have claimed responsibility for dozens of missile and drone attacks on Israel and U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since the Gaza war erupted about 18 months ago. The two Iraqi security officials said Sudani was pressing for disarmament from all the militias of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which declare their allegiance to Iran\u2019s IRGC or Quds Force rather than to Baghdad. Some groups have already largely evacuated their headquarters and reduced their presences in major cities including Mosul and Anbar since mid-January for fear of being hit by air attacks, according to officials and commanders. The U.S. State Department said it continued to urge Baghdad to rein in the militias. \u201cThese forces must respond to Iraq\u2019s commander-in-chief and not to Iran,\u201d it added. Shahbndar, the Shi\u2019ite politician, said the Iraqi government had not yet finalised a deal with militant leaders, with a disarmament mechanism still under discussion. Options being considered include turning the groups into political parties and integrating them into the Iraqi armed forces, he added. The shift comes at a precarious time for Tehran\u2019s regional \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d which it has established at great cost over decades to oppose Israel and U.S. influence but has seen severely weakened since Palestinian group Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel on October 7 2023 tipped the Middle East into conflict. Iraq is seeking to balance its alliances with both America and Iran in its dealing with the militias on its soil. The groups sprang up across the country with Iranian financial and military support in the chaotic wake of the 2003 U.S. invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, and have become formidable forces that can rival the national army in firepower. U.S. Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth told Prime Minister Sudani in a phone call on March 16, shortly after the American strikes on the Houthis began, to prevent the militias carrying out revenge attacks on Israel and U.S. bases in the region in support of their allies, according to two government officials and two security sources briefed on the exchange. The Iraqi-based militias had launched dozens of drone and rockets attacks against Israel in solidarity with Hamas since the Gaza war began and killed three U.S. soldiers in a drone operation in Jordan near the Syrian border last year. Ibrahim al-Sumaidaie, a former political adviser to Sudani, told Iraqi state TV that the United States had long pressed Iraq\u2019s leadership to dismantle Shi\u2019ite militias, but this time Washington might not take no for an answer."

Ozgur Ozel was reelected at an extraordinary congress of the Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP, which he called to prevent what he said was a plot by the government to appoint a caretaker for the party. The arrest of Istanbul\u2019s opposition Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu on corruption charges has ignited large-scale anti-government protests. Imamoglu had emerged as the main challenger to Erdogan\u2019s 22-year rule since he was elected mayor of Istanbul in 2019, overturning a quarter-century of rule by parties from Turkey\u2019s conservative Islamist tradition. The opposition claims the charges against Imamoglu are politically motivated, but the government insists the judiciary is independent and free of political interference. While in prison, Imamoglu was confirmed as the CHP\u2019s presidential candidate for the election scheduled for 2028, but which will likely to take place earlier.Ozel said he decided to call Sunday\u2019s party congress on March 21, two days after Imamoglu\u2019s arrest and hours before the alleged government caretaker was to be appointed for CHP. Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, suffered a major setback during municipal elections last year, when the CHP retained control over key cities like Istanbul and Ankara while also making huge gains elsewhere. In the months since that election, many opposition mayors of both the CHP and the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Equality and Democracy Party, or DEM, have been replaced by government-appointed caretakers on terrorism charges, which the parties strongly dispute."

            "text": "The protests began after the government arrested Imamoglu, the man seen as posing the most serious electoral challenge to Erdogan in years, on March 19. (Reuters) The arrest of an opposition presidential candidate last month has triggered Turkiye\u2019s largest anti-government protests in more than a decade, uniting demonstrators from different walks of life and sometimes diametrically opposed political views. It includes supporters of popular Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, and young people who see all politicians as ineffective. Protesters range from the socialist left to the ultra-nationalist right, and from university students to retirees. They are united by a sense that the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has grown increasingly authoritarian, diminishing the secular and democratic values and laws that the country was built upon. They are fueled by outrage at Imamoglu\u2019s arrest and the government\u2019s attempts to quell the ensuing protests. The protests began after the government arrested Imamoglu, the man seen as posing the most serious electoral challenge to Erdogan in years, on March 19. Prosecutors accuse him of corruption and aiding an outlawed Kurdish organization. The largest protests have happened alongside rallies of Imamoglu\u2019s center-left pro-secularist Republican People\u2019s Party, known as the CHP, but many young protesters said they don\u2019t support the party. In the days after the mayor\u2019s arrest, thousands of students converged near Istanbul city hall. Some waved Turkish flags; others held images of left-wing figures from the 1970s and sang a Turkish version of the Italian protest song \u201cBella ciao.\u201d In images on social media, some protesters made the ultranationalist \u201cgrey wolf\u201d hand sign, standing next to others showing the leftists\u2019 raised fist. Some showed the peace sign favored by both leftists and pro-Kurdish groups, while others chanted slogans attacking the banned militant Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party. More than 2,000 people, including journalists, have been detained since the protests began. Around 300 were formally arrested on charges including \u201cjoining an illegal protest\u201d and \u201cresisting the police,\u201d with some accused of \u201cterrorism links.\u201d Lawyers for the arrested students say that the charge of \u201cjoining an illegal protest\u201d does not justify extended detention, and that the number of arrests is \u201cunusually high\u201d compared to offenses such as terrorism or drugs. Others were there to speak out against as what they perceived as a slide away from Turkiye\u2019s secular and democratic values under Erdogan. Mehtap Bozkurt, a 70-year-old pensioner and a CHP supporter, joined a protest outside Istanbul city hall. \u201cThis country is secular and will remain secular,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will resist until the end. I am ready to give my life and blood for this issue.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean that people protesting aren\u2019t practicing Muslims, said Esen, the Sabanci academic. \u201cThere are Muslims, religious people and those who at least perform some religious duties amongst the protesters,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they also probably define themselves as secular.\u201d Esen says the protests may mark a pivotal moment for Turkiye. \u201cWill the police violence used by the government against them make them throw in the towel after a certain point or will it bring about a bigger showdown and make this a long-term affair? If the latter happens, I will be very optimistic about Turkiye becoming democratic again. If the former happens, all of this is heading toward a very bad place,\u201d he said. A young female protester wearing a mask watched the standoff with police unfolding near city hall last week. \u201cI am here today because I do not accept autocracy,\u201d she said. \u201cEkrem Imamoglu\u2019s arrest means that we accept that there will be no more elections in this country. I do not accept this.\u201d"

(Reuters Photo) Pope Francis made his first public appearance since being discharged from hospital two weeks ago after treatment for double pneumonia, entering St. Peter\u2019s Square at the Vatican in a wheelchair on Sunday to greet cheering crowds. Francis, 88, had been out of public view since March 23, when he had given a short greeting before leaving Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital after more than five weeks of treatment in the most serious health crisis of his 12-year papacy. The pope, in a previously unannounced move, came out to the square shortly before noon (1000 GMT) at the end of the celebration of a Mass for the Catholic Church\u2019s Jubilee year. Coming in front of the main altar for the service in bright sunshine, Francis waved to the crowds, before speaking briefly. The pope smiled broadly as he greeted crowds. His voice, though weak, sounded stronger than it had during the March 23 appearance, when he struggled to speak. Francis usually offers a weekly noon-time prayer in St. Peter\u2019s Square on Sundays. But he has not been able to do this since February 9, before going to hospital. He was admitted to hospital on February 14 for a bout of bronchitis that developed into double pneumonia, an especially serious condition for him as he had pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed Francis came so close to death at one point during his 38-day stay in hospital that his doctors considered ending treatment so he could die in peace, the head of his medical team said last month. Sunday\u2019s Mass was part of a special celebration in honour of healthcare workers and those who are sick. In a written message released by the Vatican shortly after noon, <strong>Francis said he had felt God\u2019s closeness during his time in hospital. It is unclear how often the pope will appear in public in the coming weeks, with Easter Sunday just two weeks away. Doctors have prescribed Francis with a two-month period of rest at his Vatican residence, to allow his ageing body to heal, and the Vatican has removed all previous commitments from the pope\u2019s calendar."

            "text": "French officials say Algiers is adopting a policy that aims to wipe France's economic presence from the country. (AP photos) France and Algeria resume diplomatic dialogue on Sunday after months of bickering that have hurt Paris\u2019 economic interests in its former colony, seen mutual accusations of humiliation and stalled vital security cooperation. Ties between Paris and Algiers have been complicated for decades, but took a turn for the worse last July when Macron angered Algeria by recognising a plan for autonomy for the Western Sahara region under Moroccan sovereignty. French officials say Algiers is adopting a policy that aims to wipe France\u2019s economic presence from the country, with trade falling by as much as 30% since the summer. A poor relationship has major security, economic and social repercussions: trade is extensive and some 10% of France\u2019s 68 million population has links to Algeria, according to French officials. Barrot arrives in Algiers on Sunday for a day of talks. That comes after a call between President Emmanuel Macron and his Algerian counterpart Abdelmadjid Tebboune on March 31, during which the two agreed to a broad roadmap to calm tensions. French officials say Algiers has put obstacles to administrative authorisations and new financing for French firms operating in the country. Nowhere has it been felt more than in wheat imports. Beyond business, the relationship has also soured to the point where security cooperation, including over Islamist militancy, stopped. The detention by Algiers in November of 80-year-old Franco-Algerian author Boualem Sansal also worsened the relationship. He has since been sentenced to five years in prison. Paris hopes he will be given a presidential pardon, diplomats say. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau has called for a 1968 pact between the two countries that makes it easier for Algerians to settle in France to be reviewed, after Algiers refused to take back some of its citizens who were ordered to leave France under the \u201cOQTF\u201d (obligation to leave French territory) deportation regime. The relationship between the two countries is scarred by the trauma of the 1954-1962 war in which the North African country, which had a large settler population and was treated as an integral part of France under colonial rule, won independence. Macron has over the years pushed for more transparency regarding France\u2019s past with Algeria while also saying that Algeria\u2019s \u201cpolitico-military system\u201d had rewritten the history of its colonisation by France based on \u201ca hatred of France\u201d. \u201cPresident Macron recognised the Moroccan character of Western Sahara, a move Algeria views as a betrayal. With no sign Macron will ever reverse this decision, the Algerians will not be making it easy for French firms to do new business in their country,\u201d said Jalel Harchaoui, associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute."

Reuveni could not tell the judge upon what authority he was arrested in Maryland. Xinis, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, ruled Friday that there was no legal basis for Abrego Garcia\u2019s detention and no legal justification for his removal to El Salvador, where he has been held in a prison that observers say is rife with human rights abuses. \u201cPlenty of tweets. Plenty of White House press conferences. But no actual steps taken with the government of El Salvador to make it right,\u201d he told the judge on Friday. Abreho Garcia fled El Salvador around 2011 because he and his family were facing threats by local gangs. In 2019, a U.S. immigration judge granted him protection from deportation to El Salvador."

Paxton has denied accepting bribes or misusing his office to help Nate Paul, the real estate developer. The judgment also stated that the employees made their reports to law enforcement \u201cin good faith\u201d and that Paxton\u2019s office did not dispute any claims or damages in the lawsuit.\u201cIt should shock all Texans that their chief law enforcement officer, Ken Paxton, admitted to violating the law, but that is exactly what happened in this case,\u201d said Tom Nesbitt, an attorney for Blake Brickman, and TJ Turner, an attorney for David Maxwell, in a joint statement. Paxton was at the center of a federal investigation after eight employees reported his office to the FBI in 2020 for bribery allegations. He agreed to settle the lawsuit for $3.3 million that would be paid by the Legislature. However, the House rejected his request and conducted its own investigation and impeached Paxton in 2023. He was later acquitted in the Senate.In November, the Texas Supreme Court overturned a lower-court ruling that Paxton testify in the lawsuit."

(Reuters) Russia\u2019s defence ministry said on Saturday Ukraine had increased its attacks on Russian energy infrastructure, hitting targets 14 times in the last 24 hours, despite a US-brokered moratorium, a charge Ukraine\u2019s military called \u201cfake\u201d and \u201cdisinformation\u201d. In a statement published on Telegram, the ministry said Ukraine \u201cmultiplied the number of unilateral attacks using drones and artillery shells on the energy infrastructure of Russian regions\u201d. It said the strikes had caused damage in Russia\u2019s Bryansk, Belgorod, Smolensk, Lipetsk and Voronezh regions, as well as the Ukrainian regions of Luhansk and Kherson, parts of which Russia controls. Reuters was unable to verify the reports of the strikes. In its own statement on Telegram, Ukraine\u2019s military said that the reports were fake, and that its forces were only striking military targets. Ukraine\u2019s military has previously said it halted strikes on Russian energy facilities on March 18. Russia and Ukraine agreed last month to a U.S. proposal for a 30-day moratorium on striking each other\u2019s energy infrastructure. Both sides have since repeatedly accused each other of violating the deal. Separately on Saturday, authorities in two Russian regions reported Ukrainian drone strikes on local industrial facilities. The governor of Russia\u2019s Volga river region of Mordovia said Ukrainian drones had struck an industrial facility. Media reports said it was an optical fibre factory in the region\u2019s capital, Saransk. A source in Ukraine\u2019s SBU security service told Reuters that the target was a plant producing industrial explosives, and that the strike had caused multiple explosions and fires. On Friday, a Russian strike on the Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih killed at least 19 people, including nine children, local officials said. Russia\u2019s Defence Ministry said it targeted a military gathering in the city, a statement the Ukrainian military denounced as disinformation."

(AP Photo/Vahid Salemi) Iran\u2019s rial currency traded Saturday at a record low against the US dollar as the country returned to work after a long holiday, costing over 1 million rials for a single greenback as tensions between Tehran and Washington likely will push it even lower. The exchange rate had plunged to over 1 million rials during the Persian New Year, Nowruz, as currency shops closed and only informal trading took place on the streets, creating additional pressure on the market. But as traders resumed work Saturday, the rate fell even further to 1,043,000 to the dollar, signaling the new low appeared here to stay. On Ferdowsi Street in Iran\u2019s capital, Tehran, the heart of the country\u2019s money exchanges, some traders even switched off their electronic signs showing the going rate as uncertainty loomed over how much further the rial could drop. Iran\u2019s economy has been severely affected by international sanctions, particularly after US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. At the time of the 2015 deal, which saw Iran drastically limit its enrichment and stockpiling of uranium in exchange for lifting of international sanctions, the rial traded at 32,000 to the dollar. Mehdi Darabi, a market analyst, said he believed that foreign pressures in recent months caused \u201cexpectations for the possibility of a decrease in oil sales and more inflation, and it caused a higher rate for hard currencies,\u201d according to Tehran\u2019s Donay-e-Eqtesad economic newspaper. Economic upheavals have evaporated the public\u2019s savings, pushing average Iranians into holding onto hard currencies, gold, cars and other tangible wealth. Others pursue cryptocurrencies or fall into get-rich-quick schemes. The falling rial has put more pressure as well on Iranian reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian. In March, when the rate was 930,000 rials to the dollar, Iran\u2019s parliament impeached his finance minister, Abdolnasser Hemmati over the crashing rial and accusations of mismanagement."

            "text": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, joined by Senators Klobuchar, Wyden, and Cortez Masto, addresses reporters ahead of a voting marathon on Trump\u2019s budget agenda at the Capitol. (AP photo) Senate Republicans plugged away overnight and into early Saturday morning to approve their multitrillion-dollar tax breaks and spending cuts framework, hurtling past hardened Democratic opposition toward what President Donald Trump calls the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d that\u2019s central to his agenda. The US economy is churning after Trump\u2019s vast tariff scheme sent stocks plummeting, and experts are warning of soaring costs for consumers at home and threats of a potential recession. Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky both voted against. But with a nod from Trump, GOP leaders held on, determined to march ahead. Approval paves the way for Republicans, in the months ahead, to try to power a tax cut bill through both chambers of Congress over the objections of Democrats, just as they did in Trump\u2019s first term with unified party control in Washington. Among them were proposals to ban tax breaks for the super-wealthy, end Trump\u2019s tariffs, clip his efforts to shrink the federal government and protect Medicaid, Social Security and other services. One, in response to the Trump national security team\u2019s use of Signal, sought to prohibit military officials from using any commercial messaging application to transmit war plans. The Republicans framed their work as preventing a tax increase for most American families, arguing that unless Congress acts, the individual and estate tax cuts that Republicans passed in 2017 will expire at the end of this year. The Senate package pulls in other GOP priorities \u2014 including $175 billion to bolster Trump\u2019s mass deportation effort, which is running short of cash, and another $175 billion for the Pentagon to build up the military \u2014 from an earlier budget effort. Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 ranking GOP senator, said voters gave Republicans a mission in November, and the Senate budget plan delivers. \u201cIt fulfills our promises to secure the border, to rebuild our economy and to restore peace through strength,\u201d Barrasso said. The House and Senate need to resolve their differences. The House Republicans had already approved their version, with $4.5 trillion in tax breaks over 10 years and some $2 trillion in budget cuts pointed at changes to Medicaid, food stamps and other programs, and some have panned the Senate\u2019s approach. One Republican, Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, expressed his own misgivings about tax breaks adding to the federal deficits and said he has assurances that Trump officials would seek the cuts elsewhere. One crucial challenge ahead will be for the House to accept the way the Senate\u2019s budget plan allows for extending the tax cuts under a scoring method that treats them as not adding to future deficits, something many House Republicans reject. On top of that, the senators added an additional $1.5 trillion that would allow some of Trump\u2019s campaign promises, such as no taxes on tips, Social Security benefits and overtime, swelling the overall the price tag to $7 trillion. Republicans are also looking to increase the $10,000 deduction for state and local taxes, something that lawmakers from states such as New York, California and New Jersey say is necessary for their support. The House and Senate are also at odds over increasing the debt limit to allow more borrowing. The Senate calls for just $4 billion in spending cuts, but GOP leadership emphasizes that\u2019s a low floor and that committees will be on the hunt for far more. Already, the GOP leaders are confronting concerns from fiscal hawks in deep red states and congressional districts who want trillions of dollars in spending cuts to help pay for the tax breaks. The GOP leadership has encouraged members to just get a budget plan over the finish line, saying they have time to work out the tough questions of which tax breaks and spending cuts to include. Extending the 2017 breaks would cut taxes for about three-quarters of households but raise them for about 10%."

A superseding indictment accuses Combs of using force, fraud or coercion to compel a woman to engage in commercial sex acts from at least 2021 to 2024.The indictment, returned by a federal grand jury in Manhattan, also alleges that Combs was involved in transporting the woman \u2014 identified only as \u201cVictim-2\u201d \u2014 and other people, including commercial sex workers, to engage in prostitution during the same period. The new charges are in addition to racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges filed against Combs when he was arrested in September. They increase the total number of charges against him from three to five.In a court filing, federal prosecutors said the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. Combs, 55, denies committing any crimes. He is scheduled to stand trial May 5 and remains locked up without bail at a federal jail in Brooklyn. \u201cThese are not new allegations or new accusers. These are the same individuals, former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships,\u201d Combs\u2019 legal team said in a statement. \u201cThis was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion.\u201d Friday\u2019s superseding indictment is the third filed against Combs. In the first, in January, federal prosecutors disclosed that their case involved at least three women whom they said Combs forced to engage in commercial sex acts. They also alleged Combs showed a firearm to a female victim during a kidnapping and once dangled a woman over an apartment balcony. Combs\u2019 January indictment didn\u2019t include additional charges but modified some details of the existing ones, including adding four years to the alleged racketeering conspiracy. Prosecutors now say it started in 2004, not 2008 as the original indictment had alleged. A superseding indictment in March contained minimal changes. Combs has pleaded not guilty to the first set of charges, which allege that he coerced and abused women for years with help from a network of associates and employees while silencing victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings.

But the Trump administration\u2019s suspension of aid threatens Sri Lanka\u2019s demining operations, pushing the livelihoods of thousands like Pushparani into uncertainty. What is more uncertain for Sri Lanka now is its obligation to rid the island nation of mines by 2028 under the Ottawa Treaty, which it ratified in 2017. Demining operations in Sri Lanka started in 2002 during a ceasefire period and the US has been the major donor among 11 countries supporting the effort, contributing about 34% of the $250 million grants received for the projects so far. The US contribution was 45% of the grants received last year, according to M.M Nayeemudeen, director of the state-run National Mine Action Centre. Out of 254 square kilometers of land that originally needed to be cleared, only about 23 square kilometers are left to deal with. Whether that can be achieved by the 2028 deadline will depend on continued funding. Nayeemudeen said once the aid suspension was announced, Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign ministry appealed and the US allowed the usage of its allocated funds pending a review, a decision on which is expected on May 1. \u201cWe hope that on completion of the 90-day review period that commenced from January 24, 2025, the US government funding assistance will continue,\u201d said Ananda Chandrasiri, head of Delvon Assistance for Social Harmony, one of the four demining groups operating in the country. \u201cOtherwise it will create a grave problem for Sri Lanka to achieve mine-free status by the end of 2027 as targeted \u2026 A huge reduction of staffing levels of the four operators would be inevitable.\u201d There are around 3,000 workers, most of them recruited from among the civil war-affected communities. With the uncertainty, some groups have already started terminating their staff, Nayeemudeen said. Sri Lanka\u2019s civil war ended in 2009 when government troops crushed the Tamil Tiger rebels, ending their quarter-century separatist campaign.

(AP representational photo) The US Senate on Wednesday passed legislation that would terminate new tariffs on Canada, just hours after President Donald Trump unveiled a raft of duties on foreign goods against countries spanning the globe. The Senate voted 51-48 to approve the bill and send it to the House of Representatives, where it is likely to be shelved. In a blow to Trump, four Senate Republicans teamed up with Democrats to advance the legislation. The Democratic-sponsored bill would terminate a national emergency Trump declared on January 22, which he linked to illegal imports of the deadly fentanyl drug from Mexico, Canada and China and used to target Canada with steep new tariffs. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican, had urged defeat of the bill, arguing that shifting attention away from Canada would be \u201ca step backward.\u201d The measure needed at least four Republican votes to pass in the chamber where Trump\u2019s party holds a 53-47 majority. In an overnight social media post he urged four fellow Republicans by name to reject the bill: Senators Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul. Collins said in a speech to the Senate before the vote that Trump\u2019s proposed Canadian tariffs would hurt several industries in her home state of Maine, including its paper makers, which obtain pulp via a pipeline from Canada. As the debate wore on, Paul also attacked new, steep tariffs on Canada in a Senate speech. Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, the leading sponsor of the tariff-ending bill, noted during debate that the US-Mexico-Canada trade deal negotiated during Trump\u2019s first term as president \u201chas dispute-resolution mechanisms that would make imposition of tariffs unnecessary.\u201d"

An FBI probe in October 2023 linked him to a social media account used to exploit minor girls. (Representational file photo) A 31-year-old Indian national has been sentenced to 35 years in prison for sexually exploiting several children through a social media app where he often posed as a teenage boy to gain their trust and threatened and extorted them with child pornography when they refused his requests. Sai Kumar Kurremula, 31, an Indian national living in Edmond, Oklahoma on an immigrant visa, has been sentenced to serve 420 months in federal prison for the sexual exploitation of three children and transportation of child pornography, US Attorney Robert Troester said in a statement. At the sentencing hearing last week, US District Judge Charles Goodwin sentenced Kurremula to serve 420 months in federal prison, followed by a lifetime term of supervised release. In April last year, Kurremula was charged with sexual exploitation of children and transportation of child pornography. According to an affidavit filed in support of a criminal complaint, in October 2023, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began investigating an account on a social media messaging app involving a user who was sexually exploiting minor girls. The Internet Protocol address used to create the account led federal authorities to Kurremula. Public documents and evidence at the sentencing hearing allege Kurremula had sexually exploited at least 19 minors through the social media messaging app, often posing as a 13-15-year-old boy to gain the trust of his victims. Kurremula had pleaded guilty and admitted to sexually exploiting three minor victims and knowingly transporting images of child pornography. Specifically, Kurremula admitted that to ensure the minor victims complied, he threatened one minor that he would drive to her house and show her parents sexually explicit images of her; threatened another victim that he would come to her home and shoot her family; and threatened a third young individual that he would publicly post sexually explicit images and videos of her. \u201cThe appalling exploitation, manipulation, and coercion of multiple children by this defendant justly warranted the 35-year sentence imposed by the Court,\u201d Troester said. \u201cThis case serves as a clear warning to others that the strongest of penalties await those who exploit and victimize our children.\u201d"

            "text": "Elon Musk presents a check for $1 million dollars to a man during a town hall Sunday, March 30, 2025, in Green Bay, Wis. (AP Photo) Elon Musk gave out $1 million checks on Sunday to two Wisconsin voters, declaring them spokespeople for his political group, ahead of a Wisconsin Supreme Court election that the tech billionaire cast as critical to President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda and \u201cthe future of civilization.\u201d Musk and groups he supports have spent more than $20 million to help conservative favorite Brad Schimel in Tuesday\u2019s race, which will determine the ideological makeup of a court likely to decide key issues in a perennial battleground state. \u201cAnd if the (Wisconsin) Supreme Court is able to redraw the districts, they will gerrymander the district and deprive Wisconsin of two seats on the Republican side,\u201d Musk said. \u201cThen they will try to stop all the government reforms we are getting done for you, the American people.\u201d A unanimous state Supreme Court on Sunday refused to hear a last-minute attempt by the state\u2019s Democratic attorney general to stop Musk from handing over the checks to two voters, a ruling that came just minutes before the planned start of the rally. Two lower courts had already rejected the legal challenge by Democrat Josh Kaul, who argues that Musk\u2019s offer violates a state law. \u201cWisconsin law prohibits offering anything of value to induce anyone to vote,\u201d Kaul argued in his filing. \u201cYet, Elon Musk did just that.\u201d Musk\u2019s attorneys argued in filings with the court that Musk was exercising his free speech rights with the giveaways and any attempt to restrict that would violate both the Wisconsin and U.S. constitutions. The payments are \u201cintended to generate a grassroots movement in opposition to activist judges, not to expressly advocate for or against any candidate,\u201d Musk\u2019s attorneys argued in court filings. Musk\u2019s political action committee used a nearly identical tactic before the presidential election last year, offering to pay $1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states who signed a petition supporting the First and Second amendments. Musk\u2019s attorneys, about four hours before the rally was to begin, asked that two liberal justices who have campaigned for Crawford \u2014 Jill Karofsky and Rebecca Dallet \u2014 recuse themselves from the case. Schimel said in a national television interview that he does not control \u201cany of the spending from any outside group, whether it\u2019s Elon Musk or anyone else\u201d and that all Trump asked was whether he would \u201creject activist judges\u201d and follow the law."

            "text": "Between 74% and 95% of incarcerated women have survived domestic abuse or sexual violence, according to the Georgia Coalition Against Domestic Violence. But under the Georgia Survivor Justice Act, which passed the state House overwhelmingly with bipartisan support and awaits Senate consideration, abuse survivors could secure early release from prison. The bill calls for judges to resentence those who are incarcerated and impose shorter sentences on those who are convicted if they can tie their crimes to domestic abuse. It also would expand what can be presented as supporting evidence. It\u2019s all part of a broader move toward reform that has gained momentum nationwide as states including Missouri, Connecticut and Massachusetts consider similar legislation. Some states already have passed laws intended to reduce sentences for victims of abuse who face charges or were convicted. Goodmark hopes efforts like Georgia\u2019s will help judges and prosecutors \u201csee that victimization is much more complicated than they want it to be.\u201d Current Georgia law is strict about how lawyers can bring in evidence of domestic abuse, said Ellie Williams, legal director with the Georgia Coalition Against Domestic Violence. Under Georgia\u2019s bill, if a judge determines family violence, dating violence or child abuse contributed to a crime with a minimum sentence of life in prison, the judge, in most cases, would have to impose a sentence of 10 to 30 years in prison. Georgia\u2019s bill would also make it easier for courts to consider domestic violence in cases involving self-defense or victims being coerced into committing a crime, which is common. The Oklahoma Survivors\u2019 Act, passed last year, shortens sentences for crimes driven by domestic violence. A few have gone home. But a bill failed this year that could have provided some sentencing relief for women who were convicted under Oklahoma\u2019s \u201cfailure to protect\u201d law for not protecting children from their abusers. They often receive sentences equal to or more than their abusers."

(AP Representational Photo) US President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is terminating grants for two clean energy projects, and roughly 300 others funded by the Department of Energy are in jeopardy as the president prioritizes fossil fuels. The DOE is cancelling two awards to a nonprofit clean energy think tank, RMI in Colorado, according to a document from the agency confirming the cancellations that was reviewed by The Associated Press on Friday. One was for nearly $5.3 million to retrofit low-income multifamily buildings in Massachusetts and California to demonstrate ways to reduce the use of energy and lower planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. The other was for $1.5 million to assess business models for electric vehicle carsharing in US cities. The department wrote that it had determined the awards do not meet the administration\u2019s objectives. Both awards are on a list of about 300 clean energy projects under review. President Donald Trump declared an energy emergency early in his term and is working to speed up fossil fuel development, which he sums up as \u201cdrill, baby, drill.\u201d The burning of oil, gas, and coal is the main contributor to global warming caused by human activity. President Joe Biden tried to lock in a trajectory for reducing the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. As his term came to an end, his administration raced to award billions of dollars for clean energy and approved major offshore wind projects. Also Read: | In Modi-Trump statement, fossil fuels take centerstage as green energy takes back seat RMI spokeswoman Dina Cappiello confirmed the organization had received a termination letter for the EV carsharing viability work and had anticipated it. That work won\u2019t proceed as a result of the funding being pulled back. As of Friday afternoon, she said she hadn\u2019t seen a second letter, but the retrofitting work is due to finish in June using a grant announced during Trump\u2019s first term. The Department of Energy said in a statement late Friday that the department \u201cacted in the best interest of the American people\u201d by terminating the grants. As for other grants on the list, the statement said, the department is still conducting a wide-ranging review. E&E News first reported last week that the DOE was creating a \u201chit list\u201d of clean energy projects awarded billions of dollars that the Trump administration could wipe out. The list, obtained by the AP, includes wind, solar, battery storage, and electric vehicle infrastructure projects. It includes funding to help heavy industries transition away from fossil fuels and funding to decarbonize buildings. Many projects were funded through the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law Biden signed in 2021. Separately, the Environmental Protection Agency terminated grant agreements this month worth $20 billion issued by the Biden administration under a so-called green bank to finance clean energy and climate-friendly projects. A federal judge has blocked the administration from ending the grant program for now. US Rep. Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio Democrat, said halting clean energy projects will increase energy costs for families and businesses, and the Energy Department must carry out duly enacted spending laws. RMI has received government contracts and grants under Republican and Democratic administrations since its founding in 1982. Cappiello said that money has been used to help advance secure, reliable, efficient, and clean energy solutions. The current administration\u2019s actions will slow and could eventually halt the many benefits of moving a clean energy agenda forward, such as lowering energy costs, making communities resilient, and creating jobs, she said in a statement."

The decision comes just a day after a Supreme Court panel voted to put Bolsonaro on trial in a separate case, where he is accused of conspiring to overthrow the government following his defeat in the 2022 election. Brazil\u2019s Federal Police had formally accused Bolsonaro last year of falsifying his vaccination records. According to police, his former aide, Mauro Cid, fraudulently obtained COVID-19 vaccination records for Bolsonaro and his daughter, Laura, at the then-president\u2019s request. Prosecutor General Gonet argued that the fraud accusations against Bolsonaro relied solely on Cid\u2019s plea-bargain testimony.

            "text": "The U.S. judge whom President Donald Trump has argued should be impeached for blocking him from using wartime powers to deport Venezuelan migrants is set to hear a new lawsuit over administration officials\u2019 use of the messaging app Signal to share highly sensitive military plans. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington was assigned on Wednesday to a lawsuit alleging Trump officials violated federal record-keeping laws by using a Signal group chat to discuss looming military action against Yemen\u2019s Houthis. The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday by a liberal-leaning government watchdog group, American Oversight, which argued that officials failed to implement measures to prevent the automatic deletion of messages in the Signal chat, in violation of their duties under the Federal Records Act. The lawsuit seeks a court order declaring their actions unlawful and an injunction requiring Trump administration officials including Hegseth to preserve records and recover any deleted materials to the extent possible. The administration has not responded to the lawsuit. But officials have said no classified information was shared on Signal, which White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called an approved app loaded onto government phones at the Pentagon, Department of State and Central Intelligence Agency. The case was assigned to Boasberg, the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, through the court\u2019s usual random assignment process, a court spokesperson said. The judge last week instructed Justice Department lawyers to give him a justification for the administration\u2019s failure to return the flights carrying alleged Venezuelan gang members deported to El Salvador on March 15 despite his order blocking such deportations for two weeks."

The company was to invest a total of USD 1 billion in generating electricity from wind at two projects and laying transmitting lines to take it to users. The plan came under the scrutiny of the newly elected administration under President Dissanayake who wanted to reduce electricity costs. In response, Adani said they have decided to respectfully withdraw from the USD 400 million project after already incurring a five million dollar expenditure on it. President Dissanayake said Sri Lanka had received bids for renewable projects which would cost the purchasing price half the Adani offered 8.26 US cents per unit. \u201cI urge the Government to continue the policies introduced by my Government.

Thaksin, Thailand\u2019s most influential and polarising politician, has loomed large over Thai politics for the past 24 years. He returned home in 2023 and spent six months in detention in hospital under a government led by the Pheu Thai Party he founded, before being released on parole. He has spoken openly and frequently about policies that include legalising gambling and adopting cryptocurrency and championed a $14 billion handout scheme to stimulate the economy, all of which the Pheu Thai-led government has pursued.

(AP) Efforts by New Mexico lawmakers to contain violent crime took centre stage on Saturday at the conclusion of an annual legislative session \u2014 just hours after three people were killed and 15 injured in an outburst of gunfire at a public park in Las Cruces. A public safety law signed by the governor in February included enhanced penalties for mass-shooting threats, fentanyl trafficking and repeated vehicle thefts, while also banning devices \u2014 such as the Glock switch \u2014 that convert guns into automatic weapons. Legislators also sent the governor bills that establish a trust fund to underwrite an expansion of addiction and mental health services, while identifying gaps in the system. Legislators are grappling with public concern about not only crime but also the proliferation of homeless encampments in New Mexico. Beyond New Mexico, a tough-on-crime approach is back in political favour, with Republicans and Democrats alike promoting new law enforcement initiatives in state capitols."

(AP) Foreign ministers from Japan, China and South Korea reaffirmed the importance of denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula and sought common ground in areas like ageing, low birth rates, natural disasters and cultural exchange at a meeting that took place at a time of growing tensions. At a joint news conference after the talks, Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya said he, his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi and South Korea\u2019s Cho Tae-yul agreed on the need to promote mutual understanding and tackle shared, multi-generational concerns to gain wider support for trilateral cooperation. Wang said that China supports the formation of a mutual regional economy and proposed further efforts toward achieving an economic framework for the three countries. He said trilateral cooperation in a range of areas including technology, climate exchange and other issues will \u201cserve as key driving force for East Asian cooperation.\u201d The meeting on Saturday focuses on plans for a trilateral leaders\u2019 summit later this year amid growing political and economic uncertainty at home and challenges from U.S. President Donald Trump. The three-way meetings are an accomplishment for Japan, which has historical and territorial disputes with both China and South Korea. An earlier trilateral meeting was held in South Korea last year. Cho, whose country chaired their leaders\u2019 first summit after a four-and-half-year hiatus due to the pandemic, said the ongoing global crisis makes the trilateral cooperation more important than ever and it is important to maintain their positive flow. He said that their cooperation is especially important as the world faces tension and divisions, and that their cooperation in areas of common challenges will set a good model for global cooperation. Later Saturday, delegations from Japan and China were to meet separately to hold their first high-level economic dialogue since April 2019. Iwaya and Wang will also hold separate bilateral talks with Cho. US allies Japan and South Korea have rapidly improved ties, as they share mutual concerns over China\u2019s growing threat in the region. Tokyo and Beijing agreed in December to improve ties in spite of their differences, including disputes over a group of uninhabited islands that both claim, as well as China\u2019s territorial disputes with other countries in the South China Sea."

(AP) Israeli forces have advanced deeper into the Gaza Strip and blew up the only specialised cancer hospital in the war-torn territory, as Israeli leaders vowed to capture more land until Hamas releases its remaining hostages. The hospital was located in the Netzarim Corridor, a band that splits Gaza in two and was controlled by Israeli troops for most of the 17-month-long war. Israel moved to retake the corridor this week shortly after breaking the ceasefire with Hamas. The truce had delivered relative calm to Gaza since late January and facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages. The Israeli military said it struck the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, which was inaccessible to doctors and patients during the war, because Hamas militants were operating in the site. Turkey, which helped build and fund the hospital, said Israeli troops at one point used it as a base. Dr. Zaki Al-Zaqzouq, head of the hospital\u2019s oncology department, said a medical team visited the facility during the ceasefire and found that, while it had suffered damage, some facilities remained in good condition.

Human rights groups and U.N.-backed experts have accused accused Israel of systematically destroying Gaza\u2019s health care system. Israel warns it will escalate military operations Israel\u2019s renewed military offensive in the Gaza Strip threatens to be even deadlier and more destructive than the last, as it pursues wider aims with far fewer constraints. Defence Minister Israel Katz said Friday that his country would carry out operations in Gaza \u201cwith increasing intensity\u201d until Hamas frees the 59 hostages it holds \u2014 24 of whom are believed alive. \u201cThe more Hamas continues its refusal to release the kidnapped, the more territory it will lose to Israel,\u201d Katz said. The Israeli military said Friday its forces were planning fresh assaults into three neighbourhoods west of Gaza City, and issued warnings on social media for Palestinians to evacuate the areas. The warnings came shortly after the military said it intercepted two rockets fired from northern Gaza that set off sirens in the Israeli coastal city of Ashkelon. Hamas had also fired three rockets the previous day, causing no casualties, in its first attack since Israel ended the ceasefire. Israeli forces advance in Gaza\u2019s north and south Israeli troops had moved Thursday toward the northern town of Beit Lahiya and the southern border city of Rafah, and resumed blocking Palestinians from entering northern Gaza, including Gaza City. A strike east of Gaza City on Friday killed a couple and their two children, plus two additional children who weren\u2019t related to them, according to witnesses and a local hospital. The Israeli army said it struck a militant in a Gaza City building and took steps to minimize civilian harm. It was not immediately clear if the army was referring to the same strike. Hundreds killed in Gaza since ceasefire collapsed Around 600 Palestinians have been killed since Israel relaunched the war with a wave of predawn airstrikes across Gaza on Tuesday, which came as many families slept or prepared to start the daily fast for the holy month of Ramadan. Israel had already cut off the supply of food, fuel and humanitarian aid to Gaza\u2019s roughly 2 million Palestinians, aiming to pressure Hamas over the ceasefire negotiations. The attack by Hamas-led militants on October 7, 2023, killed some 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. Most of the hostages have been freed in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more. Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants, but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence."

Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was arrested in a dawn raid on his residence on Wednesday over alleged corruption and terror links, escalating a crackdown on opposition figures and dissenting voices. Several other prominent figures, including two district mayors, were also detained. A man with the Turkish flag on his back stands in front of anti riot police officers during clashes in a rally against the arrest of Istanbul\u2019s Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, in Istanbul, Turkey. (AP) Many view the arrest as a politically driven attempt to remove a popular opposition figure and key challenger to Erdogan in the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. Government officials reject accusations that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated and insist that Turkey\u2019s courts operate independently. His arrest has sparked the largest protests since 2013, when Turkey was rocked by mass anti-government demonstrations that left eight people dead. On Friday, the leader of Turkey\u2019s main opposition party, Ozgur Ozel, renewed a call on supporters to take to the streets for peaceful demonstrations, while authorities widened a ban on protests and criticised the appeal as irresponsible. Addressing the rally, Ozel accused Erdogan of using the judiciary as tool after failing to defeat the mayor \u201cin a fair way.\u201d Erdogan, increasingly authoritarian after more than two decades in office, said the government would not tolerate street protests and accused the opposition party of links to corruption and terror organizations. \u201cAn anti-corruption operation in Istanbul is being used as an excuse to stir unrest in our streets. I want it to be known that we will not allow a handful of opportunists to bring unrest to Turkey just to protect their plundering schemes,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cPointing to the streets instead of courtrooms to defend theft, plunder, lawlessness and fraud is a grave irresponsibility,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cJust as we have not surrendered to street terrorism until now, we will not bow to vandalism in the future either.\u201d The most violent clash was at Ankara\u2019s Middle East Technical University late Thursday, when police fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse the demonstration.

All rights reserved. Flight tracking data and exclusive satellite imagery reviewed by India Today's Open-Source Investigation (OSINT) team suggest that a VVIP aircraft matching the description used by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was present at the Nur Khan airbase around the time of the Indian Air Force (IAF) strikes on May 10, highlighting the strategic sensitivity and vulnerability of the country's most important airbase. The Nur Khan Air Base, located adjacent to Islamabad, supports both Pakistan Air Force (PAF) operations and serves as the principal hub for the country's top VVIP air traffic. Satellite imagery from space company Satellogic provided exclusively to India Today TV by Earth intelligence platform SkyFi, provides new details of the events, which took place at Pakistan's most high-profile air base. The Pakistan government uses a white Gulfstream G450 (G-IV-X) almost exclusively for the Prime Minister, President and Foreign Ministers. The IAF targeted the air base in Rawalpindi that likely destroyed a command and control unit, satellite pictures showed. The aircraft in the imagery matches the profile of Pakistan's VVIP transport, notable for its length, tail shape and rear-mounted engines. It also lacks the visible blue tail marking the other Gulfstream operated by the Pakistan Army, often used by its army chief, General Asim Munir. The subsequent movement of the aircraft further supports its identification. On May 12, the aircraft flew from Lahore to Sialkot using the PAK02 callsign, typically reserved for the Prime Minister. The destination and timing align with the PM's publicly reported travel. Pakistan operates three Gulfstreams for VVIP use. At the time of the IAF strikes, data indicates that two Gulfstreams could have been present at the Nur Khan base while the other was positioned in Lahore. The satellite imagery taken hours after the impact, however, shows only one at the Rawalpindi base. The same Satellogic imagery also reveals the presence of an Il-78 aerial refuelling tanker at Nur Khan following India's strike, indicating active military operations from the base even after the incident. The Il-78 is a key asset for in-flight refuelling and supports deep-strike or extended patrol operations by fighter aircraft. Nur Khan is not just an airbase, it is the nerve centre for Pakistan's VVIP and high-level military aviation. Its proximity to Islamabad, and its dual-use role, make it one of the most sensitive air installations in the country. This evidence offers context to why Pakistan sought a ceasefire so swiftly on May 10. The exposure of top government aircraft and aerial refuelling assets at the country's most critical base may have underscored the risk of further escalation.

Meanwhile, the Congress' Madhya Pradesh unit said that they have already filed an FIR today and demanded the minister's dismissal.

A division bench of Justice Atul Shridharan has given strict orders to the Director General of Police to immediately file an FIR against the minister. The court said that the FIR should be filed within four hours under any circumstances. Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Jitu Patwari said that he filed a complaint against Shah over his objectionable remarks. Questioning BJP silence on the issue, he said, \"In his address to the nation, PM Modi said that he salutes the valour of the armed forces, and he also said that the whole country stands in support of the armed forces in this difficult time...

India has successfully test fired a new low-cost counter-drone system called Bhargavastra, marking a significant advancement in tackling the growing threat of drone swarms. The system's micro rockets were successfully tested on Tuesday at the Seaward Firing Range in Odisha's Gopalpur, meeting all specified performance targets. Bhargavastra, designed in hard kill mode, boasts of advanced capabilities for detecting and eliminating small and incoming drones at distances of upto 2.5 km. Two trials were conducted by firing one rocket each. One trial was conducted by firing two rockets in salvo mode within two seconds. All four rockets performed as expected and achieved the required launch parameters, underscoring its pioneering technology in mitigating large-scale drone attacks. Bhargavastra employs unguided micro-rockets as the first layer of defence capable of neutralising swarms of drones with a lethal radius of 20 metres and guided micro-missile (already tested earlier) as the second layer for pinpoint accuracy, ensuring precise and impactful neutralisation. Designed for seamless deployment across diverse terrains, including high-altitude regions (greater than 5,000 m above sea level), the system addresses the unique operational demands of India's armed forces. Highlighting Bhargavastra's adaptability and cost-effectiveness, the SDAL emphasised its indigenous design and the development of dedicated rocket and micro-missile to neutralise hostile UAVs. Furthermore, the system is modular and can have an additional soft-kill layer to include jamming and spoofing to provide an integrated and comprehensive shield for all branches of the armed forces. According to Bhargavastra's developers, the system represents a significant stride in counter-drone technology. Its open-source architecture suggests that while several advanced nations are developing similar micro-missile systems, a domestically conceived multi-layered and cost-effective counter-drone system with swarm neutralisation capabilities like Bhargavastra is yet to be deployed anywhere else globally."

According to sources, Turkish advisors helped Pakistani Army officials coordinate drone attacks on India after Operation Sindoor. Pakistan has reportedly used Bayraktar TB2 and YIHA drones against India. The drones are believed to be used for target designation, and potentially kamikaze strikes, especially to threaten forward Indian positions or supply convoys. Turkey's strategic defence ties with Pakistan have grown at an alarming rate in recent years. The Turkish government has not only supplied critical military hardware but has also conducted training for Pakistan's army. In fact, the 'Boycott Turkey' movement gained momentum due to Ankara's growing proximity to Islamabad, which, in turn, harmed Indian interests -- as seen in the recently concluded conflict between South Asian neighbours. Experts believe that the expansion of Indian exports to Turkey following Covid-19 has helped Turkey ramp up its defence production. On the intervening nights of May 7 and 8, the Pakistan Army used around 300\u2013400 drones to target Indian military infrastructure along the northern and western borders. \"Forensic investigation of the wreckage of the drones is being done. Initial reports suggest that they are Turkish Asisguard Songar drones,\" Colonel Sofiya Qureshi said in a press briefing on Operation Sindoor. \"The Indian armed forces shot down many of these dones using kinetic and non-kinetic means. The possible purpose of such large-scale aerial intrusions was to test air defence systems and collect intelligence,\" Colonel Qureshi added. India on Wednesday blocked access to Turkish news outlet TRT on microblogging platform X over Ankara's military support to Islamabad in its recently-concluded four-day conflict with Delhi. In a press briefing on Operation Sindoor, the Army said that Pakistan had used Turkish-made drones to target military infrastructure in 36 locations from Leh to Sir Creek."

            "text": "BJP's move to include caste enumeration in the forthcoming census appeared to be shaped by past electoral setbacks. (File photo) In a politically significant decision ahead of the Bihar Assembly elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led central government has announced that caste enumeration will be conducted alongside the upcoming decennial national census. The move is widely interpreted as a calibrated attempt to counter the opposition INDIA bloc's growing demand for a nationwide caste census \u2014 an issue that has gained traction in Bihar's deeply caste-sensitive political landscape. The announcement comes amidst speculation that the BJP is seeking to pre-empt a possible division of Hindu votes along caste lines, which could undermine its electoral prospects in a state where identity politics has historically overshadowed religious consolidation. Bihar had already conducted a state-level caste survey in 2023 under Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led then Mahagathbandhan government, which included the Janata Dal (United), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), and the Congress. The survey\u2019s findings were made public on October 2, 2023. At the time, the decision to undertake the survey had received unanimous support from all parties in the state, including the BJP, which was in the opposition. Yet, demands for a nationwide enumeration persisted, with both Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his then-deputy Tejashwi Yadav pressing the Centre to take up the issue. Ironically, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, during recent visits to Bihar, criticised the state-conducted survey and called for a fresh national caste census \u2014 despite his party being part of the government that carried out the 2023 exercise. Political analysts view the Centre's decision as both a tactical masterstroke and a damage-control measure. \"The BJP has failed to project a strong Hindutva figure like Yogi Adityanath in Bihar and has had to engage with the region\u2019s entrenched caste arithmetic,\" said Abhay Mohan Jha, a Patna-based political commentator. By embracing caste enumeration, the BJP appeared to be adapting to the ground realities of Bihar's politics, where electoral outcomes have long been shaped more by caste coalitions than communal mobilisation. Analysts suggested that the saffron party is aiming to neutralise one of the Mahagathbandhan's central campaign planks, while simultaneously retaining key allies at the Centre, inlcluding Nitish Kumar and Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan. The BJP's move also appeared to be shaped by past electoral setbacks. In the 2015 Bihar elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav had successfully turned the tide in his favour after RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat suggested a review of the reservation policy \u2014 fuelling fears among OBCs, SCs, and STs of a rollback in affirmative action. Caste is still the cornerstone of electoral strategy in Bihar, with the RJD banking on its traditional Yadav-Muslim base, and the Janata Dal (United) leaning on support from Kurmis, Koeris, OBCs, and Mahadalits. \"Our demand for caste census is longstanding. It will provide accurate data for planning and ensure the development of marginalised communities,\" Nitish Kumar said in response to the Centre's recent announcement. Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Chaudhary echoed the sentiment from the BJP's side, stating, \"The caste census will enable better socio-economic planning for deprived sections of society\". RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav hailed the move as a belated acknowledgement of socialist politics. \"The first caste survey was done in Bihar under our 17-month Mahagathbandhan government. The issues we raised three decades ago are now setting the national agenda. We'll continue to make these Sanghis dance to our tune,\" he said. Even Rahul Gandhi welcomed the government's 'sudden' decision to include caste enumeration in the forthcoming census after \"11 years of opposing it\". He also credited Congress's sustained campaign and said that it was the pressure put by the grand old party on the government for the caste census has worked. \"It doesn't matter what the BJP thinks. We have shown that we can pressure the BJP into doing the caste census,\" Gandhi said at a press conference. \"We wholeheartedly welcome this decision but demand a clear implementation timeline,\" the Gandhi scion said."

            "text": "Turkish aviation company, Celebi, handles operations across major airports in India, managing over 5,40,000 tonnes of cargo annually. (Image for representation/Unsplash) Turkey has supplied armed drones and operators to Pakistan during the latest military confrontation and what should be of concern is that a Turkish joint-venture company, Celibi Aviation, handles high-security tasks at eight Indian airports, including in Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai. It manages 58,000 flights in India annually. Many of the tasks that Celebi Aviation performs in India -- especially those related to ground handling, cargo management, and airside operations -- are considered high-security jobs due to the sensitive and regulated nature of the airport environment. Its staff operate in airside zones, which are high-security areas of airports, and come in direct contact with aircraft. Celebi staff also handle cargo logistics and passenger baggage, including items destined for international flights. Turkey provided military assistance to Pakistan as it tried to swarm the Indian air defence system after India struck terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (POK) on May 7 as part of Operation Sindoor. Not just military drones, Turkey provided Pakistan with operatives to handle those drones, showing that it joined in with Pakistan to attack India, sources told India Today TV. Turkey has taken an Islamic turn under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and taken Pakistan's side on the Kashmir issue. India assisted Turkey with relief material after the massive 2023 earthquake, launching Operation Dost. However, it would likely be considering the status after it came to light that Istanbul provided personnel to operate the drones and assisted in the attack on India. Celebi, performing high-security tasks at several key airports in India, might also be seen as a red flag. The airlines serviced by Celebi Aviation in India include IndiGo and Air India among others. Since its entry in 2008, Celebi has expanded its presence in India's aviation sector. It handles over 58,000 flights and 5,40,000 tons of cargo annually, with a workforce of 7,800 employees, according to its official website. Celebi entered India with a joint venture at Mumbai International Airport, where it was mandated to provide ground handling services. Within a year, Celebi officially registered its operations in India under two entities: Celebi Airport Services India for ground handling and Celebi Delhi Cargo Terminal Management India for cargo services at New Delhi International Airport. Celebi's services in India include passenger services, load control and flight operations, ramp services, general aviation services, cargo and postal services, warehouse services, and bridge operations. Celebi Aviation Holdings conducts nearly 75 percent of its business with foreign carriers, while the remaining 25 percent is with Indian airlines, according to a Moneycontrol report. Celebi Aviation has been looking to expand its footprint in the Indian aviation market for years. During the Air India privatisation process, the company in 2016 expressed interest in acquiring Air India\u2019s ground handling unit, the Air India Airport Services Limited (AIASL). Celebi stepped into the aviation industry with Celebi Ground Handling in 1958. It was Turkey's first privately owned ground-handling services company, according to the company website. It operates in 70 airports in six countries across three continents, according to the Celebi website. The high-security jobs that some Celebi staff perform need background checks and Airport Entry Passes (AEPs) issued by aviation security authorities like BCAS (Bureau of Civil Aviation Security). While Celebi is registered in India and its staff are background-checked, it being of Turkish origin might cause some discomfort because of the sensitive and high-security tasks its staff are engaged in at airports."

Shaw was on duty near the border fence and in uniform, carrying his service rifle, when he reportedly moved towards a shaded area to rest. In the process, he unknowingly crossed into Pakistani territory, where he was apprehended by the Pakistan Rangers. Following his detention, officials from both the Indian Army and Pakistan Rangers had initiated a flag meeting to resolve the matter and secure the jawan's release. Notably, the jawan accidentally crossed the border a day after the dastardly April 22 Pahalgam terror attack in which terrorists opened fire in the Baisaran valley, killing 26 people."

Earlier in April 2024, China had released a fourth list of 30 new names of various places along the line of actual control (LAC) in India's northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh last year in 2024. This was not the first time China tried to rename places inside Indian territory. China released a list of so-called 'standardised' geographical names in Arunachal Pradesh, which Beijing recognises as Zangnan, state-run Global Times reported.

Apart from the list of names, the Chinese ministry also shared detailed latitude and longitude and a high-resolution map of the areas. In 2017, Beijing had released the initial list of 'standardised' names for six locations in Arunachal Pradesh. This was succeeded by a second list comprising 15 places in 2021, with another list featuring names for 11 additional places released in 2023. Meanwhile, India has stayed firm in its rejection of China's attempt to claim territories in Arunachal Pradesh, asserting that the state is an integral part of the country and assigning 'invented' names does not alter this reality."

            "text": "The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has reportedly changed its player replacement policy for the remainder of the IPL 2025 season. All 10 franchises have now been allowed to sign temporary replacements for the rest of the tournament. Earlier, the replacement player rules for IPL 2025 permitted such changes only in cases of injury or illness before a team's 12th league match. The replacement rules have been revised as the IPL 2025 is set to resume on May 17 after a one-week suspension caused by military tensions between India and Pakistan. The BCCI has reportedly made the decision to address player availability issues, particularly among overseas cricketers who are unable to return due to national duties, personal reasons, or injuries. However, players signed as temporary replacements under the new rule will not be eligible for retention ahead of the IPL 2026 auction. These players must re-enter the pool through the next auction if they are to return to the league. According to ESPNcricinfo, in a memo sent to franchises, the IPL stated: \"Given the non-availability of certain foreign players due to national commitments or personal reasons or any injury or illness, Temporary Replacement Players will be allowed until the conclusion of this tournament. This decision is subject to the condition that the Temporary Replacement players taken from this point forward will not be eligible for retention in the following year.\" The league also clarified that replacements approved before the suspension remain unaffected by the rule change and will still be eligible for retention. These include Sediqullah Atal (Delhi Capitals), Mayank Agarwal (Royal Challengers Bengaluru), and Nandre Burger and Lhuan-dre Pretorius (both Rajasthan Royals), all signed shortly before the tournament was paused. Australian batter Jake Fraser-McGurk, who was bought by Delhi Capitals for Rs 9 crore at the mega auction, has informed the franchise that he will not return for the remainder of the season. The DC management has signed Mustafizur Rahman as Fraser-McGurk's replacement for Rs 6 crore. The Bangladesh pacer, who previously represented DC in the 2022 and 2023 seasons, returns for a third stint but will not be eligible for retention under the updated guidelines. The rule change is intended to give teams greater flexibility during the final stretch of the season while ensuring clarity around long-term squad planning. With the league entering its closing stages, franchises now have the opportunity to reinforce their squads, even if only temporarily, despite the limited availability of several key players."

This comes after India launched Operation Sindoor in retaliation to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, and Pakistan responded with aerial attacks across border towns using missiles and drones last week. \"And when you see that Pakistani ground-based air defence system has been hit, then the Pakistani air force has been pushed away from the border to India,\" he added. INDIA TODAY EXCLUSIVE | Military historian hails #OperationSindoor : He also explains why #Pakistan was not being able to deploy its air defence systems. pic.twitter.com/fOt4Pimhkz\u2014 IndiaToday (@IndiaToday) May 13, 2025 \"This also meant that the Indian air force was able to go closer to the Pakistani airspace and launch its missiles deep inside Pakistan,\" he added. \"And the final nail in the coffin was when India not only hit Pakistani airbases but, and I know this is contrary to the official statements, when it started hitting nuclear weapons storage facilities,\" Cooper said. On being asked about why Pakistan was not able to employ its air defence system effectively, the military historian added that there was a fundamental switch in India's strategy, and in this case, \"all of a sudden, the politics changed its opinion\". \"What's interesting is your armed forces' ability to adapt and act accordingly,\" he further said. Tom Cooper also said that the world knew about India's capability, but it was never demonstrated before. \"And all of a sudden, within 24 hours, India showed that it can hit Pakistan this hard,\" he added. In a pre-dawn operation on May 10, the Indian Air Force (IAF) carried out precision strikes on 11 military sites deep inside Pakistan using air-launched weapons. The targeted locations included key airbases in Rafiqui, Murid, Nur Khan, Rahim Yar Khan, Sukkur, Chunian, Pasrur, and Sialkot, according to the Ministry of Defence."

A short video shared by Elon Musk on the social media platform X shows the robot performing fluid and expressive dance moves, prompting many viewers to wonder if what they saw was even real. The video quickly gained traction, with millions of views and widespread engagement. While some social media users questioned whether the clip was generated using artificial intelligence, Musk clarified that the footage was genuine and happening in real time. X\u2019s own chatbot, Grok, also responded to one user\u2019s query, stating the clip likely showed the actual Optimus robot. The AI cited previous demonstrations, including Tesla\u2019s \u2018We, Robot\u2019 event in October 2024 and updates from April 2025, as proof that the robot had already shown off basic tasks like walking and coordination. Social media users were both amused and amazed. One user joked about turning Optimus into a wall painter, saying Tesla would sell millions if that were the case. Another praised the robot\u2019s capabilities, suggesting that such innovations could reduce work-related physical injuries once deployed at scale. Tesla originally revealed its plans for a humanoid robot during its AI Day in 2021, though at that time it was more of a concept \u2014 quite literally, with a person dressed in a robot costume dancing on stage. In 2022, Tesla brought early prototypes to life, showcasing limited but functioning mobility. Since then, the robot has gradually developed into a more advanced machine capable of carrying out simple real-world tasks. The new video suggests that Tesla is not only making technical progress but also building public interest in Optimus through relatable moments. Whether the robot will be painting walls, working in warehouses or helping at home, the latest glimpse adds to the growing curiosity about its future role in society."

            "text": "Realme is all set to expand its Realme GT 7 series in India, with two new phones expected to join the GT 7 Pro \u2014 the Realme GT 7 and GT 7T. For those who don\u2019t know, Realme has already released the GT 7 duo in China, but until the Indian versions are officially unveiled, we can\u2019t be certain how similar they\u2019ll be to their Chinese counterparts. Interestingly, the Chinese variant of the GT 7 closely resembles what is being referred to as the GT 7T in India. In fact, there isn\u2019t a GT 7T model in China at all. On top of that, the Indian version of the GT 7 isn\u2019t getting the Dimensity 9400+ chip found in the Chinese variant. It\u2019s a bit of a confusing situation, which is why we\u2019re focusing solely on the Indian versions of the upcoming Realme GT 7 phones. Here\u2019s everything we know so far. Realme has officially confirmed that both the GT 7 and GT 7T will launch globally \u2014 including in India \u2014 on May 27. The launch event is set to take place in Paris, France, with the start time scheduled for 1:30 PM IST. Both phones are expected to go on sale via Realme\u2019s official website, Amazon India, and across other online and offline retail channels. While Realme hasn\u2019t revealed any pricing just yet, we can take some clues from last year\u2019s GT 6 series. The Realme GT 6 and GT 6T launched in India at starting prices of Rs 40,999 and Rs 30,999, respectively. So, it\u2019s fair to expect the GT 7 and GT 7T to be priced similarly. Realme GT 7 series: Specs and expected features Unlike its Chinese counterpart, which runs on the Dimensity 9400+ chip, the Indian version of the Realme GT 7 is confirmed to be powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 9400e processor. It\u2019s also expected to pack a massive 7,000mAh battery with support for 120W fast charging. The Chinese version features a slightly larger 7,200mAh battery, but what\u2019s coming to India still looks very promising. Another highlight is that the Realme GT 7 is being marketed as the world\u2019s first smartphone to feature a graphene cooling layer beneath both the rear panel and the display. This should, at least in theory, deliver improved thermal management and help the phone stay cool even under intense use. The phone is also confirmed to be available in two colour options: IceSense Blue and IceSense Black. Other key features expected on the Realme GT 7 include a 6.78-inch full-HD+ OLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate, a dual rear camera setup with a 50-megapixel primary sensor, and a 16-megapixel front-facing camera for selfies and video calls. As for the Realme GT 7T, there\u2019s still limited information available about the device. So far, it\u2019s said to launch with 8GB RAM. The device carries the model number RMX5085 and has reportedly been spotted on the TKDN certification site in Indonesia. Realme has also confirmed that the GT 7T will come with NFC support. Additionally, it will feature something called INT, which is believed to function similarly to Apple\u2019s Intercom feature \u2014 allowing users to send and receive short voice messages between devices, such as from one GT 7T to another, or across compatible Realme devices. According to the phone\u2019s official landing page, the Realme GT 7T will come in three colours: blue, black and a signature yellow with a black strip design."

Central to this success was the deployment of the Akashteer system, an advanced air defence command and control mechanism that played a pivotal role in neutralising aerial threats and safeguarding the nation's mainland. Akashteer's performance in Operation Sindoor exemplifies the critical role of advanced technology in modern warfare. As India continues to develop and deploy indigenous defence technologies, systems like Akashteer will be central to maintaining national security and strategic superiority. Developed by Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) under the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' initiative, Akashteer is a fully automated and integrated air defence system designed to enhance the speed, coordination, and effectiveness of India's air defence operations. During Operation Sindoor, the Akashteer system was instrumental in countering Pakistan's offensive maneuvers. Its interoperability with India's Akash surface-to-air missile batteries, Spyder systems, and indigenous radar networks like Rohini and Arudhra allowed for seamless coordination and precision engagement of intrusions from Pakistan\u2019s airspace. The successful deployment of Akashteer during Operation Sindoor not only neutralised immediate threats but also sent a strong message regarding India's defence capabilities."

Turkey\u2019s strong alignment with Pakistan appears to be a new development. Reports also suggest that since 2024, Turkey has put a blanket ban on defence-related exports to India.

Yunus and Rana discussed the Bangladesh-Nepal-India tripartite agreement signed in October last year, under which Bangladesh is importing 40 MW of power from Nepal using Indian transmission lines. Both sides agreed there was room for larger-scale hydropower projects. Yunus also said that Bangladesh is committed to expanding access to healthcare for neighbouring countries. \u201cOur upcoming 1,000-bed hospital in Rangpur will be open to patients from Nepal and Bhutan as well. We believe in regional health security and shared prosperity,\u201d he added. Rana expressed Nepal\u2019s interest in stronger bilateral ties and said, \u201cAll our parliamentarians want to work closely with Bangladesh. We\u2019re serious about strengthening our economic partnership and boosting people-to-people connections.\u201d Muhammad Yunus has referred to India's Northeast on more than one occasion in the past couple of months. During his China visit in March, Yunus had made a pitch to Beijing that included India's seven northeastern states. While urging Beijing to establish an economic foothold in Bangladesh by leveraging its strategic position as the \"only guardian of the ocean\" in the region, Yunus said, \"The seven states of India, the eastern part of India, are called the Seven Sisters. They are a landlocked region of India. They have no way to reach out to the ocean.\" The remark had drawn a sharp reaction from Indian leaders. Experts had also flagged that China's growing influence in its immediate neighbourhood would be of concern to India. Bangladesh is of strategic importance to India, and several places in the country are close to the Siliguri Corridor, also referred to as the Chicken's Neck, a tiny strip of land that connects the northeast states to the rest of India."

The verdict, therefore, noted the cessation of employment by the woman cannot be viewed as \"voluntary abandonment of work, but as a consequence necessitated by the paramount duty of child care\". The man argued that the family court erred in not considering the fact that the woman left her matrimonial home on her own volition and did not resume her ties with the husband despite a court order. The woman, on the other hand, submitted she was unable to work owing to her responsibilities towards the child. She said her past employment wasn't a valid ground to deny her rightful maintenance and argued since it took long hours to commute and she couldn't find work near home, she gave up her teaching career."

A day after announcing his retirement from Test cricket, Virat Kohli travelled to Vrindavan with his wife Anushka Sharma to seek spiritual guidance from the spiritual leader. On Tuesday, Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma visited Shri Hit Radha Keli Kunj Ashram in Vrindavan, where they held a spiritual conversation, known as Ekantik Vartalaap, with Shri Hit Premanand Govind Sharan Ji Maharaj. The couple received blessings from the spiritual leader. During their recent meeting, as the couple greeted the spiritual teacher, he gently asked Kohli, \u201cPrasanna ho? (Are you happy?).\u201d Kohli replied, \u201cJi, abhi thik hain\u201d (Yes, I'm okay).\u201d Maharaj Ji then advised him to remain well and steady. Virat Kohli & Anushka Sharma ?

            "text": "INS Vikrant was among the warships that blockaded Karachi port during Operation Sindoor, according to sources. In a significant escalation of maritime readiness, the Indian Navy deployed 36 frontline naval assets, including INS Vikrant and several submarines, near Karachi during Operation Sindoor, according to sources. This marked a sharp contrast to the six warships mobilised during the 1971 operations targeting the city. Following the recent terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam in which 26 people were killed, India launched a tri-pronged pressure strategy on Pakistan. The Navy was placed on high alert, prompting Pakistan to issue NAVAREA warnings amid fears of a possible naval strike. At the heart of the deployment was the Carrier Battle Group INS Vikrant, sources said, accompanied by 8 to 10 warships, forward deployed into the Arabian Sea. This marked one of the Indian Navy\u2019s largest real-time operational movements outside routine peacetime exercises. The deployment included seven destroyers equipped with BrahMos missiles, Medium-Range Surface-to-Air Missiles (MRSAM), and Varunastra heavyweight torpedoes, capable of engaging surface, aerial, and underwater threats. Also in position were seven stealth guided-missile frigates, including the newly inducted INS Tushil, forming a formidable naval wall off the western coast. An estimated six submarines operated in close coordination below the surface, adding a stealth component to India's maritime posture. The operation also saw participation from fast attack crafts and missile boats, bringing the total number of assets to around 36\u2014outnumbering the Pakistan Navy, which currently fields fewer than 30 warships. Pakistan\u2019s naval fleet reportedly remained confined within Karachi harbour, unable to respond effectively due to the Indian Navy\u2019s overwhelming presence. The heightened risk even led to international commercial vessels re-routing to avoid the tense waters around Karachi. The Indian armed forces launched Operation Sindoor on May 7 to avenge the Pahalgam attack where 26 people - mostly tourists \u2013 were killed. Subsequently, the two countries were involved in military actions against each other. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh told an all-party meeting on May 8 that at least 100 hardcore terrorists and their associates were killed in Indian strikes on terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK) under the ongoing Operation Sindoor. The two neighbouring countries reached an understanding for ceasefire on May 10."

            "text": "Justice Nagarathna will create history becoming the first female Chief Justice of India and the longest serving female judge in the Supreme Court. (Image Credit: File/Supreme Court of India) Justice Bhushan Ramkrishna Gavai, who was sworn in on Wednesday as the 52nd Chief Justice of India, will serve as the CJI till November 23. If Gavai's six-month tenure looks short, one needs to consider that the probable first woman CJI would have a term of just 36 days. It has been 75 years since the Supreme Court of India was established and yet, no woman has been appointed as the CJI. Justice Gavai's name was recommended by the collegium as the next CJI and the President granted her approval. Justice Gavai will be serving as the top judicial officer for six months, the same as the current CJI, Sanjiv Khanna. Until now, all 51 Chief Justices of India have been men and only 11 women have served as judges on the Supreme Court. As per the seniority rule, Justice BV Nagarathna will become the first woman Chief Justice of India in 2027. Even though her tenure will last for a mere 36 days, it will not be the shortest. The shortest serving CJI was Justice Kamal Narain Singh, whose tenure lasted just 17 days. This rule is linked to the duration that Supreme Court judges serve as the CJI and has been debated, as the tenures are associated with stability and effectiveness. While Justice Yeshwant Vishnu Chandrachud served as the Chief Justice of India for 7 years and 139 days, the longest ever, Justice Kamal Narain Singh served the shortest tenure of merely 17 days. Following him was Justice S Rajendra Babu, who served for 29 days and, if the seniority rule is followed as it is, Justice BV Nagarathna will be serving the third-shortest tenure served by a Chief Justice, which is 36 days. The 40th Chief Justice of India, Palanisamy Gounder Sathasivam, remarked on the short tenure of CJIs, saying, \"There were many things that I wanted to do but couldn't do due to (my) short tenure,\" two days before demitting office. History was created when Justice Fathima Beevi became the first woman judge to be appointed to the Supreme Court in 1989, but she served the shortest tenure of 2 and a half years out of all the appointed woman judges to the apex court. Even as BV Nagarathna will retire after serving the longest term a female justice has served on the Supreme Court, of 6 years 2 months, her tenure as the 54th CJI will last just 36 days. Justice BV Nagarathna will become the first woman Chief Justice of India in its 75-year history. She will also hold the record of having served the longest tenure as a woman judge in the apex court, that is, six years and two months. Conclusively, as her father, Justice ES Venkataramiah, served as the 19th CJI, hers will be the second father-child duo in the history of India to have served as Chief Justices of India."

BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) secretary Devajit Saikia has reiterated the obvious proposition with India Today, saying that the batting stalwarts will continue to get all the services provided in their contract. As the senior duo called their time on the longest format of the game, a section of fans wondered if they would continue to retain their Grade A-plus category contracts announced by the BCCI in April 2025. Since the contracts were handed for the time period between October 1, 2024 - September 30, 2025, the duo will remain in A-plus category. \u201cBoth players (Virat and Rohit) are playing for India, so why the question of not having them in A+ category? Both will continue in the same grade and will get all the facilities of that grade,\u201d Saikia told India Today. Traditionally, the BCCI hands the A-plus contract to the top-performing players playing all three formats. In the current cycle, Ravindra Jadeja, Jasprit Bumrah, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have been included in the A-plus contracts. Hence, the senior duo will keep their A-plus contracts for the ongoing cycle and are most likely to be demoted in the next cycle. Meanwhile, Rohit and Kohli have left gaping holes in the Indian Test team ahead of the all-important tour of England."

The Union Cabinet on Tuesday approved the establishment of a new semiconductor manufacturing unit near the upcoming Noida International Airport at Jewar, under the India Semiconductor Mission. The project will be executed by a joint venture between India\u2019s HCL Group and Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn. This marks another critical milestone in India\u2019s push to build a vibrant domestic semiconductor ecosystem, reduce reliance on imports, and position itself as a key player in the global chip supply chain. With five semiconductor facilities already in advanced stages of construction, the new unit will be the sixth under the Mission, further strengthening the country\u2019s high-tech manufacturing base. The HCL-Foxconn plant will be set up in the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) region and is designed to produce display driver chips used in mobile phones, laptops, automobiles, personal computers and other electronic devices with visual displays. The facility is expected to handle a monthly capacity of 20,000 wafers, with an output of up to 36 million units per month. HCL brings decades of hardware development experience, while Foxconn is one of the world\u2019s largest electronics manufacturers, giving the partnership both technical depth and global scale. The upcoming HCL-Foxconn plant adds momentum to a strategic shift that\u2019s been years in the making, but success will ultimately depend on how quickly these projects scale and integrate with global supply chains."

            "text": "Actor Samantha on Wednesday shared a few photos on her Instagram account, celebrating the release of her first production venture - 'Subham'. The 38-year-old shared a bunch of photos, in which she could be seen posing with her rumoured partner, director Raj Nidimoru (of Raj and DK). In one photo, she was seen resting her head on Raj's shoulders on a flight. A post shared by Samantha (@samantharuthprabhuoffl) Samantha and Raj have been rumoured to be in a relationship for over a year now. The duo also visited the Tirumala temple together last month, making fans more curious about their relationship. The actor's post attracted many comments from fans, noticing the vibe of her equation with Samantha. \"Samantha with raj (heart emoji)\", wrote one, while another said, \"Conformation of her love (sic).\" \"It's official raj and sam are in love (sic),\" read one comment on her Instagram post. Another one coined a new name for them and wrote, \"Samraj is new name for u both (sic).\" Neither Samantha nor Raj has confirmed the rumours of their relationship. Their next outing together is 'Rakt Brahmand: The Bloody Kingdom' on Netflix, which also features Pushkal Puri, Wamiqa Gabbi and Ali Fazal, among others."

            "text": "'Mission Impossible-The Final Reckoning' is releasing in India six days before its US release. The film features Tom Cruise returning to play his most iconic role - the rogue IMF (Impossible Mission Forces) agent named Ethan Hunt. The film's advance booking in India began on May 9, and as of 10 pm on Tuesday, it had sold around 38,500 tickets for the top three national chains - PVR, INOX and Cinepolis, reported the film's team in a press release. The Christopher McQuarrie-directorial began its pre-sales business on a strong note in India, by selling over 11,000 tickets within 24 hours. The figures have been calculated for the opening weekend at the Indian box office. The 'Mission: Impossible' franchise enjoys a separate fan base in India, and so does Tom Cruise. So much so that his last 'MI' film -- 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One' (2023) -- became the first Cruise-starrer to cross the benchmark of Rs 100 crore in India. 'MI 7' collected around Rs 103 crore nett in India, and now, 'MI 8' is expected to surpass that record. Upon its release in July 2023, 'Mission: Impossible-Dead Reckoning Part One' opened at a smashing Rs 12.3 crore nett. It enjoyed an extended weekend release, unlike the new film, which will only have a two-day window to fetch more numbers during its opening weekend."

A short video shared by Elon Musk on the social media platform X shows the robot performing fluid and expressive dance moves, prompting many viewers to wonder if what they saw was even real. The video quickly gained traction, with millions of views and widespread engagement. While some social media users questioned whether the clip was generated using artificial intelligence, Musk clarified that the footage was genuine and happening in real time. X\u2019s own chatbot, Grok, also responded to one user\u2019s query, stating the clip likely showed the actual Optimus robot. The AI cited previous demonstrations, including Tesla\u2019s \u2018We, Robot\u2019 event in October 2024 and updates from April 2025, as proof that the robot had already shown off basic tasks like walking and coordination. Social media users were both amused and amazed. One user joked about turning Optimus into a wall painter, saying Tesla would sell millions if that were the case. Another praised the robot\u2019s capabilities, suggesting that such innovations could reduce work-related physical injuries once deployed at scale. Tesla originally revealed its plans for a humanoid robot during its AI Day in 2021, though at that time it was more of a concept \u2014 quite literally, with a person dressed in a robot costume dancing on stage. In 2022, Tesla brought early prototypes to life, showcasing limited but functioning mobility. Since then, the robot has gradually developed into a more advanced machine capable of carrying out simple real-world tasks. The new video suggests that Tesla is not only making technical progress but also building public interest in Optimus through relatable moments. Whether the robot will be painting walls, working in warehouses or helping at home, the latest glimpse adds to the growing curiosity about its future role in society."

            "title": "Realme GT 7 and GT 7T India launch set for May 27: What to expect",
            "text": "Realme is all set to expand its Realme GT 7 series in India, with two new phones expected to join the GT 7 Pro \u2014 the Realme GT 7 and GT 7T. For those who don\u2019t know, Realme has already released the GT 7 duo in China, but until the Indian versions are officially unveiled, we can\u2019t be certain how similar they\u2019ll be to their Chinese counterparts. Interestingly, the Chinese variant of the GT 7 closely resembles what is being referred to as the GT 7T in India. In fact, there isn\u2019t a GT 7T model in China at all. On top of that, the Indian version of the GT 7 isn\u2019t getting the Dimensity 9400+ chip found in the Chinese variant. It\u2019s a bit of a confusing situation, which is why we\u2019re focusing solely on the Indian versions of the upcoming Realme GT 7 phones. Here\u2019s everything we know so far. Realme has officially confirmed that both the GT 7 and GT 7T will launch globally \u2014 including in India \u2014 on May 27. The launch event is set to take place in Paris, France, with the start time scheduled for 1:30 PM IST. Both phones are expected to go on sale via Realme\u2019s official website, Amazon India, and across other online and offline retail channels. While Realme hasn\u2019t revealed any pricing just yet, we can take some clues from last year\u2019s GT 6 series. The Realme GT 6 and GT 6T launched in India at starting prices of Rs 40,999 and Rs 30,999, respectively. So, it\u2019s fair to expect the GT 7 and GT 7T to be priced similarly. Realme GT 7 series: Specs and expected features Unlike its Chinese counterpart, which runs on the Dimensity 9400+ chip, the Indian version of the Realme GT 7 is confirmed to be powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 9400e processor. It\u2019s also expected to pack a massive 7,000mAh battery with support for 120W fast charging. The Chinese version features a slightly larger 7,200mAh battery, but what\u2019s coming to India still looks very promising. Another highlight is that the Realme GT 7 is being marketed as the world\u2019s first smartphone to feature a graphene cooling layer beneath both the rear panel and the display. This should, at least in theory, deliver improved thermal management and help the phone stay cool even under intense use. The phone is also confirmed to be available in two colour options: IceSense Blue and IceSense Black. Other key features expected on the Realme GT 7 include a 6.78-inch full-HD+ OLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate, a dual rear camera setup with a 50-megapixel primary sensor, and a 16-megapixel front-facing camera for selfies and video calls. As for the Realme GT 7T, there\u2019s still limited information available about the device. So far, it\u2019s said to launch with 8GB RAM. The device carries the model number RMX5085 and has reportedly been spotted on the TKDN certification site in Indonesia. Realme has also confirmed that the GT 7T will come with NFC support. Additionally, it will feature something called INT, which is believed to function similarly to Apple\u2019s Intercom feature \u2014 allowing users to send and receive short voice messages between devices, such as from one GT 7T to another, or across compatible Realme devices. According to the phone\u2019s official landing page, the Realme GT 7T will come in three colours: blue, black and a signature yellow with a black strip design."

            "text": "Zomato is set to make a change that could disappoint many of its loyal Gold members. Starting May 16, the company will begin charging an additional rain fee even for users subscribed to its Gold membership plan \u2014 a cost that was earlier waived as part of the perks. Here is everything we know about it. The latest change was quietly announced via the app, and we have received the notification about it, just as the monsoon season begins to make its way into several Indian cities. Rain surcharges \u2014 typically ranging between Rs 15 and Rs 35 \u2014 have long been applied during bad weather, but Gold users were previously shielded from it. That will no longer be the case. So far, Zomato Gold has offered benefits like free delivery from nearby partner restaurants and rain fee waivers. But now, while free delivery under 7km and up to 30 per cent dining discounts remain, the added cost during rain could make frequent ordering more expensive. It\u2019s worth noting that Zomato Gold still includes unlimited free deliveries from select outlets, excluding a few such as Domino\u2019s and others that manage their own logistics. These partner restaurants carry a \u201cFree Delivery\u201d tag to help users identify them. It is worth noting that the company already charges a fee during the festive season, something which Zomato acknowledged, saying: \"This fee helps us pay our bills to keep Zomato running. To maintain services during the festive season, it has increased slightly,\" That said, the removal of the rain fee exemption could reduce the overall value of the Gold membership for many users \u2014 especially during monsoon months when such charges become frequent. Whether customers continue to see the membership as worth the price remains to be seen."

In a podcast with YouTuber Gobinath, the Vice President of AI Software at Tesla revealed a few internal details, including how it is to work with the founder, Elon Musk. Additionally, he also spoke about the future of AI and predicted what it will be like in the next 10 years. The senior executive, who has his roots in Tamil Nadu, reflected on his journey from southern India to leading one of the most high-profile tech teams in Silicon Valley \u2014 and on the unique experience of working with one of the world\u2019s most influential tech entrepreneurs. Speaking about Musk\u2019s work ethic and personality, Elluswamy said, \u201cI meet with him every week. He is really smart in the sense that he can predict the future very early. He works really hard. Easily 80\u201390 hours per week. I feel fortunate to work for him. He is not afraid of taking risks. He is very funny. You can see it in person.\u201d Elluswamy\u2019s remarks highlight the demanding pace and innovation-driven culture at Tesla. His weekly interactions with Musk, he said, offer him a window into the billionaire\u2019s relentless pursuit of progress and his willingness to make bold decisions \u2014 characteristics often cited as key to Musk\u2019s success. The conversation gained traction on social media after Tesla investor Sawyer Merritt shared a snippet on X (formerly Twitter), drawing widespread interest from fans of the brand and Musk\u2019s leadership style. Merritt quoted Elluswamy\u2019s comments verbatim, further amplifying praise for Musk\u2019s foresight, risk appetite, and humorous side. As Tesla continues to push boundaries in autonomous driving and artificial intelligence, Elluswamy remains a key figure behind the scenes. In the podcast interview, he noted that all the cars manufactured in 2035 will be self-driving. He added, \"If you want, as a hobby to drive a car, you can buy an old car.\" But he hinted that driver-less cars are the future. He announced that Tesla is expecting to launch driver-less cars in some cities in the US. Explaining the driver-less cars, Elluswamy said that it is a continuous progression of technology. It is a combination of the software and the drive, with a lot of driver monitoring technology, he said. Right now, he explained, cars are highly dependent on drivers. But in the future, technology will take care of all of it. \"We don't need supervision, we will handle everything safely and if anything happens, the car is responsible,\" he added. When asked about EVs and AI-powered cars in India, Elluswamy said, \"I am not an expert in the Indian market.\" He said, while in the US the cities are far away and a layperson needs a lot of range to cover the cities, India has much less distance to cover. As batteries make up a significant portion of a car\u2019s cost, he hinted that EVs in India tend to be far more affordable than their counterparts in the United States.

Kohli\u2019s sudden retirement ahead of the all-important tour of England has left a gaping hole in the Indian Test squad, which India must fill for the crucial series. As the team management begins searching for Kohli\u2019s replacement, Kumble named Karun Nair to fill in the massive shoes, mentioning his success in the domestic season. He also stated that since Nair has the experience of playing in England, having plied his trade for Northamptonshire in County Cricket. \"Karun deserves to come back into the Indian team with the kind of domestic run he has had. So perhaps he could be the No.4 for India because I feel, you need a bit of experience. You ned someone in England who has been there and done that. He has played County cricket, so he knows the conditions. Karun may be on the other side of 30, but he is still young. If he gets an opportunity, there will be a lot more hope for youngsters to play first-class cricket. If the sheer performance in domestic cricket doesn't get recognised, it becomes a bit of a challenge,\" Kumble told ESPNCricinfo. His last appearance in Test cricket was back in 2017 against Australia in Dharamsala, and he was never picked again following the tour to England in 2018. He\u2019s likely to be picked in the India A squad, which will face the England Lions in two four-day matches during the May-June window in preparation for the five-match Test series against England. A stellar show in the series could well open the doors for a return for Karun Nair."

            "title": "Don't thrust Test captaincy on Shubman Gill, Bumrah best option: Kris Srikkanth",
            "text": "Shubman Gill has played 32 Tests for India in his nascent career (PTI Photo) World Cup-winning former India opener Kris Srikkanth has backed Jasprit Bumrah to succeed Rohit Sharma as India\u2019s Test captain for the tour of England and beyond, saying the fast bowler deserves the honour for his contribution to the team. Speaking to IndiaToday.in, Kris Srikkanth said he wouldn\u2019t thrust the captaincy on Shubman Gill, insisting the young batter first needs to cement his place in the Test side. The former chairman of selectors was blunt in his assessment, stating that Gill, at present, is not a certainty in the playing XI in SENA (South Africa, England, New Zealand, and Australia) conditions. Srikkanth dismissed concerns surrounding Bumrah\u2019s workload, suggesting that KL Rahul or Rishabh Pant could step in as vice-captain whenever Bumrah is unavailable for a Test or two on a tour. \"Who\u2019s a ready-made captaincy candidate now? Shubman Gill? I don\u2019t think he is still a certainty in the XI,\u201d Srikkanth said. \u201cYou\u2019re not handing the captaincy to KL Rahul or Rishabh Pant. Otherwise, you give it to Jasprit Bumrah. \u201cThe other choice is Bumrah. You say, \u2018Boss, you\u2019re the captain\u2019. And whichever Test match he doesn\u2019t play, you give KL Rahul the responsibility. \u201cAs of now, I think Bumrah should be the captain. If I were the chairman of selectors, I would make Bumrah the captain. And then I\u2019d say, \u2018Boss, play whichever matches you want to\u2019. I\u2019d then appoint KL Rahul or Rishabh Pant as vice-captain, because these are certainties in the XI. Several reports have claimed that the selectors and team management are keen to hand the captain\u2019s armband to Shubman Gill as part of a long-term vision for the Test team. The selectors are reportedly concerned about Bumrah\u2019s workload management and are hesitant to appoint him as full-time Test captain. Bumrah was Rohit's vice-captain and he led India in two Tests in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in 2024-25. While he led India to a victory in the series opener in Perth, he withdrew from the fifth and final Test midway through due to an injury. Srikkanth said it would be unwise to thrust the captaincy on Gill and instead suggested the focus should be on allowing him to cement his place in the Test side. \u201cA lot is being said about Shubman Gill, but he is yet to score big runs. In England, Australia, South Africa \u2014 he has never scored. That means you\u2019re thrusting everything on him. Let Shubman Gill establish himself in Test cricket. He is a king in home conditions.\u201d The Tamil Nadu cricketer said he would have convinced Kohli to lead the Test side during the 2025\u201327 World Test Championship cycle if he were the chief selector now. \u201cNow that Rohit is also not there, there\u2019s suddenly a void when it comes to captaincy. I would have had a conversation with him before his announcement. I would\u2019ve told him: \u2018I want you to captain for the next six months or one-year period.\u2019 I would\u2019ve told him: do the job for however long you want and then retire,\u201d Srikkanth said, adding that Kohli was India\u2019s best Test captain. With the retirements of Rohit and Kohli, India now face two crucial vacancies in the Test playing XI. Srikkanth backed young Tamil Nadu opener Sai Sudharsan to be included in the 15-man squad. You have to give him solid backing. Sai Sudharsan has done well in all formats, in all conditions. You\u2019ve given Shubman Gill all the backing \u2014 please give Sai Sudharsan the same support,\u201d Srikkanth added. Sai has been one of the leading run-getters in the IPL over the last few seasons. In IPL 2025, the Gujarat Titans opener amassed 509 runs in 11 matches, forging a successful partnership with his captain, Shubman Gill."

            "title": "Inside the battle for pickleball: Arvind Ramesh Prabhoo calls for national recognition",
            "text": "Pickleball representation image. Courtesy: Getty Images Pickleball, a sport still finding its footing in India, has become the center of a dispute after the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports (MYAS) granted national federation status to the newly formed Indian Pickleball Association (IPA). The decision, made on April 25, gives IPA the authority to regulate and promote the sport nationwide, alongside financial backing. However, this has sparked protests from the All India Pickleball Association (AIPA), which has been at the forefront of pickleball's growth in India for nearly two decades. In an exclusive conversation with Indiatoday.in, AIPA President Arvind Ramesh Prabhoo expressed his dissatisfaction with the MYAS decision, describing the recognition of IPA as both premature and unjust. According to Prabhoo, AIPA has laid a solid foundation for the sport in India and should have been acknowledged for its consistent, long-term efforts. \"AIPA was established in 2008, and over the years, we have worked tirelessly to introduce, nurture, and expand pickleball across India,\" Prabhoo explained. \"We are actively involved in 24 states through our grassroots programs and have been affiliated with the International Pickleball Federation (IPF) since 2015. We have also been a founding member of the Asia Federation of Pickleball since 2020. Yet despite all this, the recognition went to IPA, a body formed just in November 2024 with little history or substantial contributions to the sport,\" he added, raising concerns about the process behind the decision. Prabhoo also pointed to a critical timeline issue, noting that AIPA had submitted its own application for national federation status months before IPA was even established. \"On October 18, 2024, AIPA officially applied for recognition from MYAS, well before IPA was even formed. Despite this, MYAS chose to recognize IPA, disregarding the work we've done over the years. This decision undermines the National Sports Code of 2011, which stipulates that an organization must demonstrate substantial activity and longevity to be eligible for NSF status,\" he said. Prabhoo went on to detail the many ways in which AIPA has been instrumental in the development of pickleball in India. The association has organized numerous national and international tournaments, developed world-class training programs, and helped countless players refine their skills for competition on the international stage. \"AIPA has been key in organizing several prestigious tournaments, such as the Bainbridge Cup in December 2022, the World Pickleball Championship in 2024, and the upcoming World Pickleball League in 2025. Between 2013 and 2025, we have conducted eight National Tournaments, six National Ranking Tournaments, the Federation Cup, and the Indian Open, to name a few,\" Prabhoo said. AIPA's efforts have not only influenced the national landscape but have also contributed significantly to the global pickleball scene. The association has been a full member of the International Pickleball Federation (IPF) since 2015 and has achieved a series of international milestones, such as hosting the World Pickleball Championship in 2024 and sending Indian teams to global competitions. \"AIPA has been instrumental in sending Indian teams to the Asian Pickleball Games in 2022, 2023, and 2024, held in Taiwan, as well as the World Pickleball Championships in Bali in 2022 and 2023. Our youth teams, including those in the under-12, under-14, and under-16 categories, have participated in the Asia Junior Pickleball Championship in Vietnam, winning medals and putting India on the global map for pickleball,\" Prabhoo stated with pride. Despite the recognition setback, AIPA remains resolute in its mission to grow the sport in India. Prabhoo acknowledged that the absence of pickleball from the Olympic roster has been a significant hurdle in securing formal recognition, but he remains hopeful that the Indian Olympic Association's (IOA) forthcoming affiliation will open the door for greater support and recognition. \"We have faced funding challenges, but our commitment to the sport remains unwavering,\" Prabhoo said. \"The recognition of IPA complicates matters, as it overlooks years of grassroots development in favor of a new organization with no established track record. The key difference between AIPA and IPA is that AIPA was formed in 2008 and has built the sport from the ground up, while IPA, formed just in November 2024, has no significant infrastructure or presence.\" Looking ahead, AIPA is focused on long-term growth both domestically and internationally. \"Our governance system is well-established, with representation in 24 states, and our international affiliations with the IPF and the Asia Federation of Pickleball are testaments to our commitment to bringing India to the world stage for pickleball,\" Prabhoo concluded."

            "text": "Star India batting duo Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli will continue to retain their Grade A-plus contract despite their recent retirement from Test cricket. BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) secretary Devajit Saikia has reiterated the obvious proposition with India Today, saying that the batting stalwarts will continue to get all the services provided in their contract. As the senior duo called their time on the longest format of the game, a section of fans wondered if they would continue to retain their Grade A-plus category contracts announced by the BCCI in April 2025. Since the contracts were handed for the time period between October 1, 2024 - September 30, 2025, the duo will remain in A-plus category. \u201cBoth players (Virat and Rohit) are playing for India, so why the question of not having them in A+ category? Both will continue in the same grade and will get all the facilities of that grade,\u201d Saikia told India Today. Traditionally, the BCCI hands the A-plus contract to the top-performing players playing all three formats. In the current cycle, Ravindra Jadeja, Jasprit Bumrah, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have been included in the A-plus contracts. Hence, the senior duo will keep their A-plus contracts for the ongoing cycle and are most likely to be demoted in the next cycle. Meanwhile, Rohit and Kohli have left gaping holes in the Indian Test team ahead of the all-important tour of England."

There\u2019s also a bevy of state elections coming up, most importantly in Bihar, where being on the right side of the caste cohort debate could pay rich dividends.

This innovative process coats the fuel tank and fenders, marking the first time Harley-Davidson has applied PVD to such large components on a production model. The result is a mirror-like brilliance that surpasses traditional chrome plating while meeting stringent corrosion-resistance standards. \u201cThe original Fat Boy redefined custom style with its bold proportions and post-war DNA,\u201d said Brad Richards, Harley-Davidson\u2019s Vice President of Design and Creative Director. \u201cThe Gray Ghost amplifies that legacy with a modern, industrial edge.\u201d Powering the Gray Ghost is a 1,923cc V-twin engine, delivering 101bhp at 4,800rpm and 166Nm of torque at 3,000rpm. Enhanced with a 2-into-2 exhaust and advanced muffler materials, the engine emphasises deep, resonant tones. A frame-mounted oil cooler and cylinder head cooling passages ensure rider comfort in hot conditions or low-speed riding. The motorcycle features recalibrated suspension for optimal comfort, with dual-bending valve 49mm front forks and hydraulic pre-load adjustment for the rear. Selectable ride modes (Road, Rain, Sport) tailor performance, while Harley-Davidson\u2019s rider safety enhancements include cornering ABS, traction control, and tyre pressure monitoring. All-LED lighting, a USB-C power port, relocated heated gear connectors, and a new 5-inch analogue-digital instrument cluster elevate the riding experience. With only 1,990 units produced, the Fat Boy Gray Ghost is a collector\u2019s dream, blending iconic style with modern performance. Although there's no official confirmation regarding its launch in India, considering the limited global production of just 1,990 units, it remains to be seen if any, will make it to the country."

            "text": "Maruti will launch a new ICE SUV this fiscal. The country's largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki India, recently announced that it will launch two new SUVs in FY26. While one will be an electric vehicle (EV), the e Vitara, the other will be an internal combustion engine (ICE) model. There have been speculations about the ICE model being the seven-seater version of the popular Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara. However, it could be otherwise, going by a recent statement from a top Maruti official. When asked if the seven-seater Grand Vitara will qualify as a new SUV or a variant, during Maruti's Q4 FY25 earnings conference call, the company's Corporate Affairs Executive Officer Rahul Bharti said: \"We keep hearing about such concepts and models about ourselves from the magazines and from analysts.\" \"So, let's wait till the time comes. I have not heard of a Grand Vitara seven-seater internally at least,\" he added. The upcoming ICE model will be Maruti's fifth SUV after the Fronx, Brezza, Jimny and Grand Vitara. Although the company has a strong SUV portfolio, another model will only help the company in enhancing its share in the ever-growing SUV segment. At present, all Maruti SUVs are five-seaters. However, the company has been testing a seven-seater SUV, which has been spied on multiple occasions. This SUV could be based on the Grand Vitara's Heartect platform. Before, the new ICE SUV enters the market, Maruti will start sales of the e Vitara. According to the company, the electric SUV will be on Indian roads before the end of September 2025."

This special funding aims to help countries tackle climate change challenges and improve disaster preparedness. However, not everyone is pleased with this support. India chose not to vote at the IMF meeting and raised serious concerns about Pakistan getting more financial help. In its official remarks, India said that Pakistan has a poor track record of using IMF loans properly and has been relying on bailouts for far too long. While Pakistan has welcomed the financial lifeline, India\u2019s objections highlight the growing international debate on how such funds are used and whether they actually lead to real change on the ground."

Prices of primary articles rose more slowly at 1.44%, while the fuel and power segment actually got cheaper, falling by 2.18% after seeing a small rise the month before. The biggest relief was seen in everyday kitchen items. Vegetables became a lot cheaper, with prices dropping over 18% in April. Onion inflation almost vanished, going from a steep 26.65% in March to just 0.20%. Potatoes, too, became cheaper, with prices falling over 6%. This comes alongside some good news on the consumer front as well. Retail inflation, which is tracked through the Consumer Price Index (CPI), dropped to a five-and-a-half-year low of 3.16% in April, down from 3.34% in March.

            "text": "India moved to retaliate against the US metal tariffs on Monday. Filing a notice at the World Trade Organisation, India said it would raise duties on select American goods, even as the two countries work to finalise a broader trade deal. What\u2019s new: India has told the WTO it will raise tariffs on US products, reacting to import taxes that have remained in place since March. Why it matters: This is India\u2019s strongest trade response to the US in recent years, and it comes just as Washington DC tries to reset trade ties with China. In-depth: The US first raised these tariffs on Indian steel and aluminium years ago. They were extended again in February and took effect on March 12. India says the US did not follow global trade rules or hold talks before doing so. This trade move comes at a tense time. Earlier this week, the US announced it would cut tariffs on Chinese goods after China refused to raise its own. Markets rose after that decision. But India saw no such relief. Instead, it got another warning. President Trump said in a press briefing that trade with India could depend on its role in talks with Pakistan. \u201cIf you stop it, we\u2019re doing trade. If you don\u2019t stop it, we\u2019re not going to do any trade,\u201d he said. India denied linking trade to foreign policy. Big picture: India stayed quiet on US tariffs for years, even lowering duties on some American products earlier this year, including bourbon whiskey and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. But now, with no sign of US cooperation, India is taking a stronger stand. The next step depends on how Washington, DC responds. What they said: \u201cIndia reserves its right to suspend concessions... equal to the harm caused by U.S. tariffs,\u201d India said in its WTO filing. \u201cIf you stop it, we\u2019re doing trade. If you don\u2019t stop it, we\u2019re not going to do any trade,\u201d said Donald Trump"

Now, both sides have agreed to a 90-day truce, dialling back tariffs as talks resume. However, another trade war began when US President Donald Trump called the European Union \"nastier than China\" on trade issues. What's new: The US and China unexpectedly agreed to slash tariffs and pause their trade war, even as Trump turned his eyes to the EU. After talks in Geneva, the US agreed to cut reciprocal tariffs it imposed on China from 125 per cent to a more digestible 10 per cent for at least 90 days. According to the agreement, US duties on Chinese goods will be lowered from 145 to 30 per cent, while China's retaliatory tariffs on US imports will be reduced from 125 to 10 per cent. Both sides agreed to continue negotiations during the truce. After the trade truce with China, Trump warned that the EU would \"come down a lot\" in trade negotiations, claiming the US has \"all the cards\" due to the significant trade imbalance, particularly in the automotive and agricultural sectors. Why it matters: The US-China tariff deal defused weeks of global market turmoil, but a new threat to Europe could escalate another trade battle. But hours after announcing the truce, Trump accused the European Union of \"extorting\" drugmakers and warned it was \"in many ways nastier than China.\" That signalled a possible new start to a trade dispute, this time with Europe. India has started fighting back against US tariffs on steel and aluminium with its taxes on some American goods. India informed the World Trade Organisation that the US tariffs on these metals are \"safeguard measures\" \u2014 trade restrictions \u2014 that will adversely impact India's trade.

During the Indian armed forces\u2019 media briefings on Operation Sindoor, two faces stood out: Colonel Sofiya Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh. Both took charge with authority, exuding composure and allaying fears. From the battlefield to the boardroom, Indian women are taking charge, and this change did not happen overnight. India Today's Data Intelligence Unit analysed the number of women in uniform and observed a steady change. In police forces across India, women comprise just under 10 per cent of total personnel \u2014 a jump from the past decades, but still far from ideal. Women personnel are more visible in civil policing roles (15 per cent), with fewer in elite units like the National Security Guard (0.7 per cent). Women's representation in the Indian Army increased from 3.8 per cent in 2020 to 4.1 per cent in 2024. In the Air Force, it has remained at around 13.4 per cent, while it has grown in the Navy from 5.5 per cent to 6.8 per cent. Women are taking leadership roles in businesses head-on, steadily claiming spaces once dominated by men across startups. The number of Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade-recognised startups with at least one woman director jumped from just 36 per cent in 2017 to 51 per cent in 2024. States like Maharashtra (14,284), Delhi (8,012), and Karnataka (8,000) have emerged as hubs of female entrepreneurship. This change is also visible in managerial positions. While men continue to hold the larger share of leadership roles in the last decade, the presence of women has been growing steadily. From 2017 to 2025, the number of women in boardrooms doubled, from 4.5 lakh to 9.1 lakh, and their representation in senior management grew from 23,685 to 38,745. Similarly, in other management roles, women increased from 4.3 lakh to 8.8 lakh in 2025. However, women's overall share has increased only slightly in all the roles. It is crucial to have women representation in the justice system. As per the data, out of the total (1,122) approved judicial positions for Supreme and High Courts in India till December 2024, only six per cent (2) and 14 per cent (106) are held by women in the Supreme Court and High Courts, respectively. However, in civil service, nearly every fourth selected candidate is a woman. These figures tell a story not just of participation but of persistence. Each increase in women's representation is a glass ceiling broken through perseverance and policy. The presence of two women defence officers as spokespersons for Operation Sindoor shows how far we\u2019ve come."

In FY25, between April and February, Karnataka was the third-highest borrower at Rs 72,025 crore, followed by Andhra Pradesh at Rs 70,057 crore, and Rajasthan at Rs 63,565 crore. Between FY21 and the April\u2013September period of FY25, Maharashtra repaid Rs 1.2 lakh crore in market borrowings \u2014 the highest in absolute terms \u2014 against a total loan of Rs 3.8 lakh crore during the period. Tamil Nadu, which borrowed Rs 4.2 lakh crore, repaid Rs 1 lakh crore. West Bengal and Rajasthan each repaid Rs 0.8 lakh crore, corresponding to total borrowings of Rs 2.8 lakh crore and Rs 2.6 lakh crore, respectively. This analysis includes only those states whose total borrowings exceeded Rs 10,000 crore over the period. Aside from Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, and West Bengal come on as the top repayers in FY24\u2013FY25. In terms of share of repayment relative to borrowings, Jharkhand stood out by repaying 51.4 per cent of its total borrowings, followed by Gujarat at 43.1 per cent, and Kerala at 35.8 per cent."

            "text": "India has always considered Turkey a close friend, and Operation Dost is evidence of that. Following the massive earthquake that hit Turkey in 2023, India sent more than 250 personnel, specialised equipment, and relief material. But now, it seems things have changed. Pakistan attacked India with around 400 Turkish drones in four days. And, it\u2019s not that Turkey did not know what Pakistan would do with those drones. Turkey\u2019s strong alignment with Pakistan appears to be a new development. Reports also suggest that since 2024, Turkey has put a blanket ban on defence-related exports to India. However, in 2021, an Indian firm, with an investment of USD 1 million, bought a 30 per cent share in the Turkish unmanned aerial vehicle producer Zyrone Dynamics. The two companies signed a partnership agreement at the International Defence Industries Fair in Istanbul, Turkey. The government of India called it a new beginning and a welcome Indian investment in the defence sector. A new beginning - welcome Indian investment in the defence sector.. Partnership agreement between @DCMShriramLtd of India and @zyronedynamics of Turkey signed at #IDEF2021 in Istanbul in the presence of @AmbSanjayPanda @SSB_Eng @anadoluagency @ANI @airnewsalerts pic.twitter.com/DkSBW0q9k2\u2014 IndiaInTrkiye (@IndiaInTurkiye) August 18, 2021 It was only during the recent tensions with Pakistan that Turkey\u2019s stance was revealed. Not only did Turkey call India\u2019s retaliatory actions after the Pahalgam attack provocative, but it also condemned them. In contrast, it said, \u201cWe support Pakistan\u2019s call for an investigation into the April 22 terrorist attack.\u201d The answer is yes. While Turkey has banned the sale of drones and other arms to India, a large portion of India\u2019s exports to Turkey can be used in making drones. India\u2019s exports to Turkey have increased post-COVID-19, and engineering goods account for the largest chunk. Aluminium and aluminium products, auto components, aircraft and parts, telecom instruments, electric machinery and equipment, are among India\u2019s major exports to Turkey."

            "text": "An open phone policy doesn\u2019t fix insecurity, say experts. (Photo: Generative AI) Ever found yourself getting a little too curious about who your partner is texting late at night? Maybe you've even considered suggesting an open phone policy just to put your mind at ease? If that sounds familiar, you\u2019ll want to keep reading. At a time when our phone literally has it all - calendars, conversations, secrets, screenshots, and sometimes even our emotional lives, it\u2019s no wonder the idea of an \u201copen phone policy\u201d has become a relationship litmus test. But is sharing passwords a sign of love\u2014or the beginning of its slow unravelling? The idea of being able to access each other\u2019s phones sounds simple enough. For some couples, it might work brilliantly because this could mean a symbol of trust, connection, and openness. As counselling psychologist Absy Sam explains, \u201cThere are couples who have complete transparency, they might even share accounts. And others who are okay with keeping things entirely separate. It depends on comfort, not correctness.\u201d Here\u2019s what an open phone policy can offer, according to Absy: \u201cAssuming that an open phone policy equals transparency is misleading; it often borders on surveillance,\u201d says psychologist and author Aanya Jai. \u201cJust like locking a bathroom door isn\u2019t secrecy but a basic right to privacy, phone access should be a personal choice, not a test of loyalty.\u201d \u201cIn many cases I\u2019ve encountered, infidelity actually tends to surface more often in relationships that already have an open phone policy,\u201d Aanya points out. \u201cPeople who cheat often thrive on the thrill of deceit. It\u2019s not about access. It\u2019s about mindset.\u201d When you feel the need to check your partner\u2019s phone, question yourself \u2013 why? The urge could be because you have been encountering some questionable behaviour, or maybe your partner has been on their phone way more than they used to. There\u2019s always a reason why you may feel the urge to know what they are up to, always. So, confront. An open phone policy doesn\u2019t fix insecurity. It doesn\u2019t replace emotional intimacy. And it certainly can\u2019t substitute for actual communication. \u201cThe phone isn\u2019t the issue,\u201d says Absy. \u201cThe deeper issues lie around fear of abandonment, poor boundaries, or past wounds that haven\u2019t healed. Sometimes, partners check phones obsessively, not out of curiosity, but out of fear. \u2018Am I being replaced?\u2019\u201d"

            "title": "The Can'ts at Cannes 2025: New 'decent' fashion rules to shift focus on films?",
            "text": "Just before the highly anticipated opening of the Cannes Film Festival, its organising committee dropped a bombshell: new dress code rules. The international film festival, which has become extremely popular over the years for its star-studded, extravagant red carpet moments, is now likely to miss its trademark drama. No nudity (sheer dresses), no voluminous silhouettes, and not even long trains. All for \u2018decency\u2019 reasons. \u201cFor decency reasons, nudity is prohibited on the red carpet, as well as in any other area of the Festival,\u201d the updated guidelines read. Hold on, there\u2019s more: \u201cVoluminous outfits, in particular those with a large train, that hinder the proper flow of traffic of guests and complicate seating in the theatre are not permitted.\u201d The ostentatious sartorial drama has long been the Cannes red carpet\u2019s strongest accomplice. Some\u2014though not all, we agree\u2014of the most memorable fashion moments featuring Indian celebrities at the prestigious film festival owe their impact to the extravagance. India\u2019s OG Cannes queen, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, has often turned to larger-than-life gowns for her red carpet appearances on the French Riviera. While she began her Cannes journey in sleek, slender silhouettes\u2014and largely stuck to them until 2017\u2014what followed was a steady stream of voluminous, statement-making looks year after year. From her fairytale moment in a pastel blue Michael Cinco ball gown to a regal red Ralph & Russo number, her butterfly-inspired 2018 look (also by Michael Cinco), the dramatic hooded black-and-silver couture gown by Sophie Couture, the floral bouquet-like ensemble by Dolce & Gabbana, to the latest kitschy green-and-silver creation by Falguni Shane Peacock\u2014voluminous silhouettes have remained her signature Cannes style. Even for international celebrities, these newly banned elements (think naked dressing\u2014wearing rather risque ensembles) and elaborate silhouettes have been go-to choices for creating noteworthy red carpet moments. And what if someone decides to ditch the new dressing guidelines? The celebrity would not be allowed to walk the red carpet at all. \u201cThe Festival welcoming teams will be obligated to prohibit red carpet access to anyone not respecting these rules,\u201d says the new update. The growing dominance of fashion over cinema at the Cannes Film Festival is something that sparks debate every year. Despite being one of the most prestigious film festivals in the world, Cannes often makes more headlines for its extravagant red carpet appearances than for the films themselves. Over time, this shift has only become more apparent, with fashion coverage overshadowing the actual films. Furthermore, the increasing presence of influencers and content creators at the festival has only added to this. At the same time, he recognises that events like the Cannes Film Festival come with their own set of expectations. \u201cIt\u2019s important to respect the institutional framework of the event one is attending, and to consider the perspective of the organisers and how they envision the festival,\u201d he says. D\u2019Souza feels that, in recent years, the red carpet has begun to eclipse the core purpose of the festival. \u201cAt the end of the day, Cannes is a film festival,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I do feel that, especially over the past few years, the focus has increasingly shifted away from cinema it often seems more like a photo opportunity or fashion parade than a celebration of film.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe this is the platform to be provocative or to wear outfits that are barely there. Nor do I think impractical, overly voluminous ensembles are appropriate when you're simply attending a film screening,\u201d D\u2019Souza tells India Today. The new dress code revelation right before the film festival kick-starts may have left many celebrities and their stylists on edge, especially if they were planning on wearing voluminous or risqu sheer ensembles. That said, the Cannes red carpet is also known for its rebellious fashion moments. Remember Heelgate? The term dates back to 2015, when 50 women were denied access to the Cannes red carpet for not wearing heels. In 2016, Julia Roberts went barefoot, and Kristen Stewart wore flats. In 2018, when Stewart was a jury member, she made a bolder move by walking up the stairs barefoot. So, you never know there might still be some naked dresses, long trains, and that hearty dose of drama that the Cannes red carpet is known for!"

            "title": "Obsessed with probiotics? You might be missing the whole prebiotic plot",
            "text": "Probiotics vs prebiotics: Which one should you choose for pristine gut health? (Photo: Generative AI) Yogurt, kimchi, kombucha, kefir \u2013 you know what they have in common? Most of you will get the answer right: they\u2019re brimming with probiotics, the so-called gut-friendly bacteria that have become the poster child of modern wellness. The narrative around probiotics (or let\u2019s say, the marketing) is so strong that now, it has become several brands\u2019 go-to excuse for you to get their products in your hands. But amid the hullaballoo around probiotics and their importance in keeping our gut condition pristine, are we missing the real plot? \u201cProbiotics are live microorganisms that can offer health benefits, but only when consumed in adequate amounts,\u201d says Dietician Vidhi Chawla, founder of FISICO Diet and Aesthetic Clinic. \u201cThey\u2019re essentially good bacteria that can help balance your gut microbiome\u2014found in fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, and sauerkraut.\u201d That\u2019s where prebiotics come in, the often-forgotten fibre-rich fuel that your existing gut bacteria need to thrive. \u201cThink of them as fertiliser,\u201d says Chawla. \u201cThey\u2019re non-digestible fibres that pass through the upper digestive tract intact and get fermented in the colon, feeding the good bacteria already living in your gut.\u201d Unlike probiotics, prebiotics aren\u2019t fragile. They\u2019re found in everyday foods, bananas (especially the slightly green ones), garlic, onions, oats, barley, legumes, flaxseeds, and they\u2019re not destroyed by digestion. While Dr. Kiran B, Consultant - Gastroenterologist, Manipal Hospital, Varthur Road, Bengaluru, doesn\u2019t deny that probiotics have become the wellness industry's darling, she raises a few questions. Chawla says that the obsession with probiotics isn\u2019t entirely unfounded, but it\u2019s just incomplete. \u201cThe idea of directly introducing \u2018good\u2019 bacteria is appealing and easily marketable, but many probiotic products lack strong scientific backing. The strains and doses vary, and survival in the gut is inconsistent,\u201d she adds. What\u2019s worse is that some products boast probiotic content but don\u2019t list actual strains or colony counts. That\u2019s like buying a mystery pill and hoping for the best. Despite all the discussion in favour of prebiotics, probiotics are still important, but with caveats. Dr. Aasima Boxwalla, associate consultant - surgical gastroenterology, GI and HPB Oncology at Manipal Hospital, explains, \u201cProbiotics break down prebiotics to produce beneficial metabolites like short-chain fatty acids. These metabolites trigger the release of peptides that help protect against conditions like IBD, allergies, even some cancers, while also strengthening the gut barrier function.\u201d So no, probiotics aren\u2019t a scam, but they are often misunderstood and overhyped. \u201cPrebiotics alone can be incredibly beneficial because they feed and support the good bacteria already present in your gut,\u201d says Dr. Boxwalla. \u201cBut pairing them with probiotics creates a synergistic effect.\u201d Here\u2019s your prebiotic-rich starter pack, straight from the experts: These are all prebiotic foods, they don\u2019t contain live bacteria, but they help the good ones in your gut thrive."

            "text": "Satellite imagery of Nur Khan airbase shows the Pakistan government's VVIP Gulfstream near the impact site. Satellite imagery Satellogic 2025. Delivered by SkyFi. All rights reserved. Flight tracking data and exclusive satellite imagery reviewed by India Today's Open-Source Investigation (OSINT) team suggest that a VVIP aircraft matching the description used by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was present at the Nur Khan airbase around the time of the Indian Air Force (IAF) strikes on May 10, highlighting the strategic sensitivity and vulnerability of the country's most important airbase. The Nur Khan Air Base, located adjacent to Islamabad, supports both Pakistan Air Force (PAF) operations and serves as the principal hub for the country's top VVIP air traffic. Satellite imagery from space company Satellogic provided exclusively to India Today TV by Earth intelligence platform SkyFi, provides new details of the events, which took place at Pakistan's most high-profile air base. The Pakistan government uses a white Gulfstream G450 (G-IV-X) almost exclusively for the Prime Minister, President and Foreign Ministers. The IAF targeted the air base in Rawalpindi that likely destroyed a command and control unit, satellite pictures showed. The aircraft in the imagery matches the profile of Pakistan's VVIP transport, notable for its length, tail shape and rear-mounted engines. It also lacks the visible blue tail marking the other Gulfstream operated by the Pakistan Army, often used by its army chief, General Asim Munir. The subsequent movement of the aircraft further supports its identification. On May 12, the aircraft flew from Lahore to Sialkot using the PAK02 callsign, typically reserved for the Prime Minister. The destination and timing align with the PM's publicly reported travel. Pakistan operates three Gulfstreams for VVIP use. At the time of the IAF strikes, data indicates that two Gulfstreams could have been present at the Nur Khan base while the other was positioned in Lahore. The satellite imagery taken hours after the impact, however, shows only one at the Rawalpindi base. The same Satellogic imagery also reveals the presence of an Il-78 aerial refuelling tanker at Nur Khan following India's strike, indicating active military operations from the base even after the incident. The Il-78 is a key asset for in-flight refuelling and supports deep-strike or extended patrol operations by fighter aircraft. Nur Khan is not just an airbase, it is the nerve centre for Pakistan's VVIP and high-level military aviation. Its proximity to Islamabad, and its dual-use role, make it one of the most sensitive air installations in the country. This evidence offers context to why Pakistan sought a ceasefire so swiftly on May 10. The exposure of top government aircraft and aerial refuelling assets at the country's most critical base may have underscored the risk of further escalation.

Yunus and Rana discussed the Bangladesh-Nepal-India tripartite agreement signed in October last year, under which Bangladesh is importing 40 MW of power from Nepal using Indian transmission lines. Both sides agreed there was room for larger-scale hydropower projects. Yunus also said that Bangladesh is committed to expanding access to healthcare for neighbouring countries. \u201cOur upcoming 1,000-bed hospital in Rangpur will be open to patients from Nepal and Bhutan as well. We believe in regional health security and shared prosperity,\u201d he added. Rana expressed Nepal\u2019s interest in stronger bilateral ties and said, \u201cAll our parliamentarians want to work closely with Bangladesh. We\u2019re serious about strengthening our economic partnership and boosting people-to-people connections.\u201d Muhammad Yunus has referred to India's Northeast on more than one occasion in the past couple of months. During his China visit in March, Yunus had made a pitch to Beijing that included India's seven northeastern states. While urging Beijing to establish an economic foothold in Bangladesh by leveraging its strategic position as the \"only guardian of the ocean\" in the region, Yunus said, \"The seven states of India, the eastern part of India, are called the Seven Sisters. They are a landlocked region of India. They have no way to reach out to the ocean.\" The remark had drawn a sharp reaction from Indian leaders. Experts had also flagged that China's growing influence in its immediate neighbourhood would be of concern to India. Bangladesh is of strategic importance to India, and several places in the country are close to the Siliguri Corridor, also referred to as the Chicken's Neck, a tiny strip of land that connects the northeast states to the rest of India."

The president also pledged to lift yearslong sanctions on Syria. \"There is a new government that will hopefully succeed in stabilizing the country and keeping peace,\" Trump said in a wide-ranging foreign policy address Tuesday in which he announced he was lifting the sanctions that have been in place in Syria since 2011. \"That's what we want to see in Syria.\" Al-Sharaa came back to his home country of Syria after the conflict began in 2011 and led al-Qaida's branch that used to be known as the Nusra Front. He later changed the name of his group to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and cut links with al-Qaida.

Indian nationals constitute one of the largest groups of student and skilled worker visa applicants to the UK. The reduction in the Graduate Route visa duration may impact their ability to gain international work experience post-study. Sanam Arora, chair of the National Indian Students and Alumni Union (NISAU) UK, expressed concerns, stating, \"Panic must not be allowed to set in among current and prospective students. Immediate clarity is needed on who is affected and how.\" The closure of the Health and Care Worker visa also raises concerns about the future of Indian professionals in the UK's healthcare sector. Dr. Dora-Olivia Vicol, CEO of the UK\u2019s Work Rights Centre, highlighted the potential risks, noting that \"more people will be put at risk of falling into insecure immigration status, putting them at greater risk of exploitation.\" The tightening of UK immigration rules comes at a time when the US has also been perceived as less welcoming to Indian students and professionals. Despite the challenges, experts suggest that opportunities remain for Indian students and professionals in the UK.

The verdict, therefore, noted the cessation of employment by the woman cannot be viewed as \"voluntary abandonment of work, but as a consequence necessitated by the paramount duty of child care\". The man argued that the family court erred in not considering the fact that the woman left her matrimonial home on her own volition and did not resume her ties with the husband despite a court order. The woman, on the other hand, submitted she was unable to work owing to her responsibilities towards the child. She said her past employment wasn't a valid ground to deny her rightful maintenance and argued since it took long hours to commute and she couldn't find work near home, she gave up her teaching career."

(Representative image) The Karnataka High Court has expressed serious concerns regarding the lack of specific legal provisions to tackle the increasing menace of \u2018wheeling\u2019, a dangerous stunt where two-wheeler riders lift the front wheel of their motorcycles while driving. Justice V Srishananda, while hearing a bail plea, noted that existing laws fail to effectively deter such hazardous behaviour. Currently, individuals performing wheeling can only be charged under provisions related to negligent or rash driving, which are considered bailable offences. However, Justice Srishananda observed that these provisions are insufficient for law enforcement to take stringent action against this dangerous activity. Given the alarming increase in such stunts, the Court has called for the state to enact stronger laws specifically targeting wheeling. \u201cIn light of the alarming increase in such incidents, it is the bounden duty of the state and enforcement agencies to introduce necessary statutory provisions and adopt stringent measures to suppress this dangerous trend,\u201d said Justice Srishananda. The Court further emphasised that wheeling not only endangers the lives of riders and pillion passengers but also poses a significant threat to public safety. \u201cYoung motorcyclists wrongly equate wheeling with bravery, unaware of the life-threatening consequences. This reckless behaviour disrupts public order and peace,\u201d the Court added."

Parkinson\u2019s disease is a brain condition that affects how a person moves. It happens when certain nerve cells in the brain that produce a chemical called dopamine begin to break down or die. MRgFUS is a modern treatment that doesn\u2019t require any cuts or implants. It works by using focused sound waves to target the exact part of the brain causing the tremors. The procedure is done using an MRI, which ensures high accuracy. It is especially useful for people with Essential Tremors (a common neurological disorder) and Parkinson\u2019s Disease where shaking is the main symptom."

(Photo: Getty Images) Spending too much time at work may not just exhaust your body, it could also be affecting your brain. A new study has found that working over 52 hours a week may lead to changes in the brain\u2019s structure, especially in areas responsible for managing emotions, memory, and decision-making. Researchers from Yonsei University in South Korea found that people who worked too much showed clear changes in parts of the brain that help with decision-making and handling emotions. Researchers looked at healthcare workers who often work long hours, comparing brain scans of those working standard hours with those putting in 52 hours or more per week. Out of these, 32 people worked long hours every week, while 78 worked normal hours. They found that people working longer hours had noticeable changes in certain parts of the brain that help with focus, emotional control, memory, and problem-solving. In fact, this area was 19% larger in people who worked long hours. Other affected areas included the superior frontal gyrus, which plays a role in decision-making and planning, and the insula, which helps us process emotions and stay aware of ourselves and our surroundings. The study adds to a growing body of evidence that overwork doesn\u2019t just increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and mental health problems, it may also lead to physical changes in the brain. \u201cThis may help explain why people who work excessively long hours often report feeling mentally and emotionally drained,\u201d said the researchers. According to the International Labour Organisation, overwork causes over 8,00,000 deaths every year around the world. This new research shines light on how overwork could be silently reshaping the brain. The researchers stress that this was a small study and doesn't prove that long working hours directly cause brain changes. It\u2019s also not clear whether the changes they observed are permanent or reversible. However, they believe their work is an important first step toward understanding how work habits may influence brain health."

            "text": "The innovative eye surgery is changing the way ophthalmologists treat patients with severe corneal conditions. (Photo: Getty Images) In a country where the shortage of donor corneas often stands between a patient and restored vision, an innovative eye surgery developed in India is offering new hope. Known as Pinhole Pupilloplasty (PPP), the technique is changing the way ophthalmologists treat patients with severe corneal conditions, without the need for corneal transplants or lengthy recovery periods. Corneal transplants are required when the cornea, the clear, dome-shaped surface that covers the front of the eye, becomes damaged or diseased to the point where it affects vision or causes pain. Injuries from trauma, infections (like herpes simplex or fungal keratitis), keratoconus etc., would need corneal transplants. In fact, the eye surgery earned Dr. Agarwal an international award at the ASCRS Film Festival in Los Angeles. The technique, now widely practiced in several countries, has been credited with restoring sight where traditional methods fall short. \"Some patients have very high astigmatism that cannot be corrected with usual methods, and toric intraocular lenses only work up to a certain level. This gave me the idea to create a pinhole effect in the pupil itself, which led to the first Pinhole Pupilloplasty,\" Dr. Agarwal told IndiaToday.in. In traditional cases of corneal scarring, eye doctors often recommend a corneal transplant - a procedure that relies heavily on donor tissue, involves a long healing period, and carries the risk of graft rejection. The pinhole pupilloplasty method uses stitches to change the shape of the pupil without needing a donor cornea, and patients recover much faster compared to traditional surgery. \"With the pinhole technique, patients recover much faster, and long-term results are very promising. It removes the risks of rejection and prolonged medication associated with corneal transplantation,\" said Dr. Agarwal. \"It's quicker and simpler, and the pupil tightens enough to reduce glare and photophobia. It\u2019s particularly useful in patients with higher-order corneal aberrations. Plus, it\u2019s reversible. We can undo it with a YAG laser if necessary,\" explained Dr. Agarwal. The surgery is ideal for patients who: For India, where the gap between demand and availability of donor corneas remains stark, the pinhole pupilloplasty surgery has immense public health implications. Estimates suggest that over 1 lakh corneal transplants are required annually in India, but only around 25,000 are performed due to limited donor supply. \u201cWith Pinhole Pupilloplasty, we can avoid transplant in many cases,\u201d Dr. Agarwal noted. \u201cIt dramatically reduces the dependency on donor corneas and also cuts down the complications of transplant surgeries.\u201d Pinhole Pupilloplasty marks a shift in how eye diseases are approached, especially in a country like India where healthcare resources are unevenly distributed. By eliminating the need for corneal grafts in certain cases and offering near-instant results, this procedure has the potential to democratize vision care. \"Knowing that this technique is helping people regain sight and confidence drives me to do what I love, to research, innovate, and impact lives with the gift of sight,\" Dr. Agarwal concluded."

To find a solution, the team analysed the genes of 1,466 women undergoing IVF. They discovered that women with a specific version of the FSH receptor gene responded better to biological hormones, while others did better with synthetic hormones. By matching treatment to genetic type, success rates improved significantly. To make this process faster and more accessible, the team developed a simple oral swab test that shows the ideal hormone treatment within an hour, visible as a pink or yellow result. They hope the test will lead to more successful IVF outcomes while reducing health risks and healthcare costs."

Reverse-searching key frames from the viral video led us to a news report uploaded to YouTube on May 12. Per the report, notorious gangster Zubair Maulana and three of his associates were arrested by the Bhopal Police. Over 55 criminal cases have been registered against him. He was accused of vandalising vehicles and firing guns in public to create panic in Bhopal. The police recovered illegal firearms and other weapons from them. We found several news reports about this incident. Per the Free Press Journal, the operation was carried out on May 8, jointly by police teams from Mangalwara, Tila Jamalpura, the Crime Branch, and Hanumanganj. Zubair Maulana had been absconding since October 2024. He was accused of triggering violence and shooting in public places to scare rivals in Bhopal\u2019s Mangalwara and Tila Jamalpura areas on May 6. We did not find any mention of Pakistan or \u201cPakistan Zindabad\u201d slogans in any news report. To confirm this, we contacted the SHO of Mangalwara police station, Ajay Kumar Soni. Speaking to India Today Fact Check, Soni refuted the viral claim that the police arrested these people for chanting \u201cPakistan Zindabad\u201d. He confirmed that the arrests were made on May 8, because he and his aides started firing guns in public.

So, the Pakistan Army chose to pick up news reports, including AajTak\u2019s, and carved out portions from them to present to the press and the international community. Shockingly, this was done by none other than Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). In a press briefing on May 11, he explained how Operation Bunyan Marsoos met all the objectives set out by Pakistan. As evidence, he showed clips of national and international news reports about cross-border airstrikes by India and Pakistan. However, not only did the Pakistan Army clip these reports to paint a false picture of its military might, but it also omitted parts of the same reports that didn\u2019t suit its narrative. Here are two such news reports that Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry twisted during the press conference: Chaudhry showed an AajTak clip, claiming the news anchor stated that Indians were panicking as their armed forces could not protect airbases from Pakistan\u2019s airstrikes. The anchor could be heard saying, \u201cThere is a visible sense of panic among people because all the airbases appear to be under attack, they look like they\u2019re engulfed in flames. The biggest concern being discussed is if you cannot protect your airbases, how will you protect the public?\u201d The original news report, however, showed quite the opposite. In it, a video shared by the Indian Army showing Pakistani airbases being targeted by India was first shown. The report begins with correspondent Jitendra Bahadur Singh explaining how India attacked Pakistan\u2019s launch pads, airbases, and critical military assets, while Pakistan used civilian flights as shields. The news anchor, Shashi Tushar Sharma, then elaborated on how people in Pakistan were panicking amid these attacks, questioning how Pakistan would save its civilians when it couldn\u2019t save its airbases. You can see the original news broadcast below. Another such \u201cevidence\u201d used by the Pakistan Army was a news report by Al Jazeera, in which journalist Umar Mehraj stated that a series of loud explosions were heard across Jammu and Kashmir just after morning prayers on May 10. He also added how Pakistani shelling in Jammu Kashmir\u2019s Rajouri killed \u201ca senior government official\u201d, referring to Additional District Development Commissioner Raj Kumar Thappa. The Pakistan Army, however, omitted these parts completely from the video shown at the presser. If splicing media reports was not enough, the Pakistan Army also doctored Wing Commander Vyomika Singh\u2019s statement from the official Indian Armed Forces press briefing of May 10. A detailed report about it can be read here."

            "title": "Supreme Court rejects 100% VVPAT-EVM verification: 'Need culture of trust'",
            "text": "The Supreme Court on Friday rejected all the petitions seeking the complete verification of votes cast using Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) with Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips. A two-judge bench comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta also rejected a demand to go back to ballot papers in elections. Justice Khanna said the \"expenses for the verification (of the program) to be borne by the candidates making the request, in case the EVM is found to be tampered, the expenses will be refunded\". Presently, VVPAT verification is done only in five randomly selected EVMs in each Assembly segment of a parliamentary constituency. At all the EVM-VVPAT verification hearings, the ECI had maintained that the EVMs cannot be tampered with under any circumstances and that the complete counting of the VVPAT slips is not practically feasible."

In response to India's Operation Sindoor, Adampur air base was one of the key targets by the Pakistani Army during the intervening nights of May 9 and 10. Flight services were disrupted after \"a small number of suspected drones\" were spotted in Jammu and Kashmir's Samba and subsequently engaged. Following the development, IndiGo and Air India suspended flights across northern and western India for the day. However, the Army said that there was \"no need to be alarmed\". On the other hand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his first public address since Operation Sindoor, warned terrorists operating out of Pakistan that they can't hide any more. India busted China's claims of not arming Pakistan with weapons after Director General of Air Operations, Air Marshal A.K. Bharti, presented evidence of a Chinese-made PL-15 long-range missile that landed in Punjab's Hoshiarpur but failed to detonate. On the other hand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday issued a stern warning to Pakistan, saying that India has only \"paused\" its military action against its neighbours, calling Operation Sindoor the \"new normal.\""

            "title": "India in focus: Airbnb doubles down on a young, growing market",
            "text": "Airbnb is playing the long game in India, betting on a rapidly growing Gen Z and millennial population to turn one of its fastest-growing markets into one of its biggest. 'We are still in investment mode in India, and we will be investing very heavily in coming years,' says Brian Chesky, chief executive of the US-based vacation home rentals company, which projects global spending by Indian travellers to reach $29 billion by 2029. In an interview with Vinod Mahanta, Chesky also talks about doing business in a volatile geopolitical environment and how AI would impact hospitality sector. Edited excerpts: Where does India stand in terms of booking value? We have our first five core markets, and then eight expansion markets after that. Right now, unfortunately, India isn't in the top 10 by size, but it is one of the fastest-growing markets on Airbnb. And I really believe India is a long game. Over time, I think it will become one of the biggest markets for us. Just look at the demographics - India has a huge population of Gen Z and millennials, and this group disproportionately chooses Airbnb compared to older generations... We're going to be investing significantly in India in the coming years. Amid escalating geopolitical tensions and tariff disruption, have you observed significant shifts in global travel patterns or traveller sentiment? We've seen some changes, but no major shifts so far. When cross-border travel slows, domestic travel often picks up - and we have strong local markets that help balance things out. We saw this during the pandemic. Of course, travel is discretionary and exposed to macro shocks. But with new services we're becoming more diversified and less dependent on any one travel pattern. Is volatile geopolitics the new normal for global businesses? Volatile geopolitics may well be the new normal. However, we've built a business that goes far beyond what most hotels or OTAs (online travel aggregators) offer. While many of them remain heavily focused on the US or Europe, Airbnb is growing fastest in Latin America and Asia. We span budget to luxury, urban to rural, young to older travellers - and now with services and experiences, we're diversifying even further. People will start using Airbnb not just when they travel, but in their own cities. That makes us more resilient. And just like major tech platforms, we're expanding our aperture, not just vertically, but horizontally. This is no longer just about vacation rentals. It's the beginning of something bigger: a real-world platform that connects people, places, and services everywhere. You mentioned that 2025 marks the beginning of Airbnb's next chapter. What will be fundamentally different in this new phase? Let me start with what's not changing. If you want to book a home on Airbnb, you still can-same experience, same ease. What we stand for isn't changing either. We've always been about real travel and authentic connection. But now we're expanding. The biggest shift is Airbnb Services. We realised people value time and skills as much as space, so we're expanding beyond homes-bringing in chefs, trainers, stylists, and photographers, while completely rebuilding Airbnb Experiences, launching Originals, and redesigning the app to support it all. This is the biggest redesign we've ever done. You don't even need to be on a trip; this fits into daily life. And this is just the beginning."

Mumbai-based gaming company Dream Sports has invested $50 million (around \u20b9427 crore) in cricket media platform Cricbuzz and North American cricket broadcaster Willow TV, both owned by Times Internet, the companies said on Tuesday. With this investment, Dream Sports will get a strategic minority interest in Cricbuzz and Willow TV, which collectively have 185 million monthly users across more than 150 countries. 'Cricbuzz and Willow sit at the heart of how hundreds of millions of fans follow cricket everyday,' Times Internet vice chairman Satyan Gajwani said. 'We're excited to work with Dream Sports to reimagine and develop new ways to collaboratively create new experiences for cricket fans across the planet.' In March 2023, Willow TV secured rights to broadcast International Cricket Council events in the US and Canada until the end of 2027, extending a partnership that began in 2016. Willow TV, the largest cricket broadcaster in North America, streams more than 1,500 live matches each year to users in the US and Canada, and has also expanded its broadcast footprint into a leading cricket broadcast platform for the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Dream Sports' investment in Cricbuzz and Willow TV will create new opportunities for fan experiences, the statement said, adding that the companies intend to collaborate to provide more real-time analysis and statistics, engagement and commerce integrations, and AI-driven predictions to Cricbuzz's audience. Times Internet is the digital arm of The Times of India Group, which publishes The Economic Times. Dream Sports cofounder and CEO Harsh Jain said: 'Dream Sports' mission is to 'make sports better' for Indian sports fans. Cricbuzz and Dream11 have worked together for over a decade, and with this investment, all cricket fans can expect much more fan engagement, interactive streams, and integrated commerce experiences that will bring them closer to the action and to each other.' Avendus Capital acted as the exclusive financial advisor to the transaction. With 200 million users, Dream Sports, which operates the fantasy platform Dream11, has been expanding its presence beyond India."

            "title": "Flipkart may limit its q-commerce expansion to top cities to reduce burn",
            "text": "Flipkart is limiting the expansion plans of its quick commerce unit, Flipkart Minutes, as it looks to add new dark stores only in the top six to eight cities. Walmart-owned ecommerce giant Flipkart is limiting the expansion of its quick commerce unit, Flipkart Minutes, to the top six to eight cities to rein in costs, according to people familiar with the matter. Flipkart Minutes, which competes with Eternal-owned Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, Zepto, BigBasket\u2019s BB Now and Amazon Now, is currently present in 14 cities and runs a network of more than 300 so-called dark stores, or mini warehouses. The intent is to scale this up to around 500-550 by October. Flipkart group chief executive Kalyan Krishnamurthy had said in April that Minutes would have 800 stores by this year-end. \u201cMore than 90 per cent of the quick commerce volumes are generated from the top eight cities and a bulk of this comes from Delhi-NCR, Mumbai and Bengaluru where Flipkart is going deeper with Minutes,\u201d one of the people said. With this shift, Flipkart joins its Bengaluru-based rival Swiggy in taking a relatively cautious approach to expansion from hereon, notwithstanding Eternal\u2019s plans to aggressively chase market share even at the cost of short-term profitability. \u201c...(Flipkart) plans to expand to 500-550 dark stores before its annual \u2018big billion days\u2019 sale. However, it is also under pressure to halve its ongoing cash burn of around $40 million (\u20b9340-350 crore) a month over the next few quarters in a bid to launch its IPO,\u201d analysts at brokerage firm HSBC Securities wrote in a May 12 research note. Flipkart did not respond to queries sent by ET. Last month, Flipkart\u2019s board cleared the company\u2019s proposal to shift its domicile from Singapore to India, ahead of a planned IPO in 2026. The process, which is underway now, was initiated almost a year after Flipkart raised $350 million from Google as part of a $1 billion funding round led by Walmart. Flipkart\u2019s tempered quick commerce push comes amid the rapid growth witnessed by the sector over the last one year \u2014 particularly when the broader ecommerce segment with a long-tail of categories has seen sluggishness. A March 2025 joint report by Bain & Company and Flipkart pointed out that India\u2019s e-tail gross merchandise value (GMV) growth slowed down to 10-12 per cent in 2024 from over 20 per cent in the previous years on account of macroeconomic consumption stress. In the same period, quarterly gross order value (GOV) for quick commerce players more than doubled, albeit on a smaller base. Even as Flipkart works to shorten delivery timelines across its broader ecommerce network, a wider expansion of Minutes could result in increased losses \u2014 as visible with Blinkit and Instamart, which together added more than 600 dark stores in the January-March quarter. Both Blinkit and Instamart, whose parents are listed, have a presence in close to 100 cities. They have significantly increased cash burn to undertake this expansion. While Blinkit, which added 294 dark stores, incurred a capital expenditure of \u20b9317 crore during the three-month period ended March 2025, Instamart spent \u20b9425 crore in capex to add 316 such micro-warehouses to its network. Blinkit\u2019s operating losses for the quarter came in at \u20b9178 crore, while for Instamart it was Rs 840 crore. ET reported on February 15 that the top three quick commerce players \u2013 Blinkit, Instamart and Zepto \u2013 were collectively burning around \u20b91,300-1,500 crore per month with Zepto accounting for the largest share. Burn rate measures how quickly a company spends its reserves before generating positive cash flow. The funds are typically used for user acquisition and maintaining growth through marketing, discounting and in this case opening new warehouses. Industry analysts noted that while promoting quick commerce in urban centres requires considerable marketing investments, it is the rapid physical expansion of opening dark stores that strains finances. \u201cFor new players, it\u2019s logical to build a sustainable model before expanding to smaller towns. In quick commerce, unless a dark store achieves around 1,000 orders per day \u2014 which typically happens in densely populated areas with high-rise buildings \u2014 it\u2019s hard to break even,\u201d said Abhishek Pathak, internet sector analyst at brokerage firm Motilal Oswal. \u201cThey (Flipkart Minutes) might be focusing on profitable growth, likely in preparation for the IPO. However, capturing market dominance in cities like Mumbai or Delhi is challenging, given the entrenched presence of Zepto, Blinkit and Swiggy,\u201d Pathak added. To be sure, Flipkart Minutes\u2019 plan to scale up to 800 dark stores will be the fastest ever in the quick commerce segment. The company had launched quick commerce operations in August 2024 in Bengaluru in a few pockets. Instamart took over two years to hit 700 dark stores that it achieved in December 2024. Zepto and Instamart topped the 1,000 dark-store-mark in the January-March quarter, whereas Blinkit had over 1,300 dark stores on its network as of March 31. The Gurgaon-based company plans to have 2,000 such warehouses by December 2025. Amazon Now is also expanding its network to 300 dark stores in Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru and Mumbai by end-2025, ET had reported in March."

The Indian healthcare AI market is on a rapid ascent\u2014projected to hit $1.6 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 40.5 per cent. Amid this digital revolution, Shikha Saxena, President of HCL Healthcare, is steering a bold transformation\u2014blending data, empathy, and innovation to redefine how India Inc. thinks about wellness. In an exclusive interview with ET Entrepreneur, Saxena shares how her team is building scalable, AI-powered, phygital ecosystems that go beyond basic health checks to deliver measurable, preventive care outcomes\u2014for both boardroom leaders and underserved populations. From smart health reports and predictive analytics to a culture of clinical accountability, her vision puts people at the heart of technology, ensuring wellness is not just accessible\u2014but deeply impactful. At HCL Healthcare, you emphasize data-driven, human-centric care. How do you balance advanced analytics with the emotional and experiential aspects of patient and employee wellbeing? With the rise of AI and advanced analytics, the role of data in healthcare has become indispensable. As the saying goes, AI will never replace the human touch in medicine, and I believe in the same philosophy. At HCL Healthcare, on average, a patient conversation at HCL Healthcare lasts 12\u201315 minutes, nearly 2-3x longer than the industry norm, ensuring patients feel heard, understood, and supported. When annual health checks or screenings surface potential risks, we don\u2019t stop at automated alerts. We proactively engage care coordinators to guide individuals through next steps, offering tailored care plans when desired. Our approach integrates analytics and empathy, ensuring that interventions are not just reactive but meaningful. Importantly, we treat emotional and experiential wellbeing as tangible, trackable outcomes. Through our corporate health programs, we continuously gather feedback from employees and corporate partners alike, using those insights to refine and elevate our services. Our AI-enabled corporate dashboards provide HR leaders with actionable population health insights and the dashboards we provide to individuals benchmark their health data against similar cohorts and empower them with tailored action plans. Reflecting on your journey through health-tech and Insurtech, which emerging technology or digital model do you believe will most profoundly reshape corporate wellness in the 3-5 years? Looking ahead, I believe the next wave of transformation in healthcare, particularly corporate wellness, will come from AI drive, hyper personalised ecosystems where insights and behavioural science intersect to deliver tangible outcomes. One exciting frontier is AI-assisted clinician support: imagine a doctor\u2019s assistant that can instantly summarize a patient\u2019s entire medical journey\u2014past diagnoses, medications, diagnostic tests, lifestyle factors\u2014all neatly integrated into the EMR. This not only sharpens clinical decisions but reduces errors and improves patient outcomes dramatically. This helps bring chronic disease management, emergency room visits, insurance claims and even absenteeism under control. By applying advanced statistical models that learn from population health trends and demographic profiles, we can map individual users to high-risk cohorts and proactively design interventions. It\u2019s not just about treating illness\u2014it\u2019s about anticipating it and shifting the trajectory before the condition escalates. And then, there\u2019s AI co-pilots that can give a hot body outcome\u2014that is, systems which give similar experience as humans using technology are gaining traction. These systems that adapt to the user habits and provide a hyper personalized experience such as LLM Co-Pilots mimic the best of human interaction but are available 24/7. These adaptive platforms nudge users toward healthier behaviours in a way that\u2019s natural and sticky. In essence, I see the next era of corporate wellness as a fusion of cutting-edge AI and compassionate care, where technology doesn\u2019t replace the human touch but augments it powerfully. Leading one of India\u2019s largest corporate health programmes requires aligning diverse stakeholders\u2014from C-suite sponsors to on-ground wellness teams. How do you cultivate a culture of innovation and accountability at scale? In healthcare, innovation isn\u2019t optional\u2014it\u2019s essential for relevance and impact. At HCL Healthcare, where we operate at the intersection of clinical excellence, advanced technology, and corporate wellness, innovation is embedded in everything we do. From enhancing AI-driven health insights to redesigning disease identification pathways and elevating user experiences, innovation drives both our scale and quality. However, innovation without accountability is meaningless. We cultivate both by fostering a culture of trust and empowerment\u2014encouraging clinicians and product teams to reimagine care delivery and build next-gen platforms. Cross-functional collaboration is key, as our work spans clinical teams, diagnostics, IT, HR, and corporate clients, all connected through feedback loops and transparent communication. Learning is institutionalized, with every employee dedicating a portion of their work hours to upskilling via platforms like Percipio. Additionally, we have recognition frameworks that reward ideas translated into measurable outcomes\u2014whether it\u2019s a new digital health initiative or improved engagement in wellness programs. Ultimately, innovation for us means making a tangible difference in the health and wellbeing of India\u2019s workforce and honoring the trust our clients place in us every day. You\u2019ve been recognized globally for driving accessible and affordable care. What bold, strategic initiative or partnership are you most excited about that could accelerate your vision for truly universal corporate healthcare? We are currently operating and driving at HCL Healthcare what we call the Integrated Phygital (physical-digital) Corporate Health model. This is designed with the intent to enhance access and continuity of care for our customers. As part of this effort, we have onboarded and are rapidly integrating with the partner ecosystem to create a seamless journey spanning from preventive care to primary, secondary and other wellness initiatives. With this model, unlike other players in the market, we don\u2019t stop at health checks but rather we see it as the start of the care journey for our patients. We have built a closed loop ecosystem where every touchpoint from risk identification to condition management is covered. We believe in measurable outcomes and our intent is to provide actionable insights to our stakeholders be it, disease trajectory for individuals or enhancing productivity metrics such as Absenteeism, reduction in hospital admissions etc amongst the employees of our corporate clients. One initiative I am particularly energized about is our AI driven smart Health Reports. These reports are designed to give not only retrospective data but also predictive insights enabling them to curate an action plan for a healthier workforce. For instance, once we identify a high risk population cluster, we can recommend targeted interventions such as secondary care, condition management, awareness sessions etc to help turn this around. I am confident that there is no other player offering such comprehensive health analytics in the market. I believe that by fusing technology and enhancing strategic partnerships, we are creating a truly agile organization that is poised to disrupt the current health tech industry."

            "title": "How Singhi Advisors built a reputation as India's go-to M&amp;A specialist",
            "text": "In an M&A landscape dominated by volume metrics and market noise, Singhi Advisors has quietly built a powerhouse brand grounded in trust, precision, and insight. In a world where financial advisory firms often market scale over substance, Singhi Advisors stands as a refreshing outlier\u2014a brand that has quietly but confidently shaped the Indian M&A landscape with insight, integrity, and impact. It all started in 1989, when Singhi Associates entered India's rapidly transforming business environment. With a clear vision but little fanfare, the firm began offering advisory solutions that prioritized depth over dazzle. Rather than rely on high-gloss pitches, Singhi focused on something marketers can relate to: customer intimacy and insight-led problem-solving. Their approach? Embedded advisory. Long before 'consultative selling' became a buzzword, Singhi was already inside boardrooms and across factory floors\u2014deeply integrating with client operations to co-create business solutions. That unique positioning soon became their brand's foundation. By 2005, as India's liberalized economy opened the floodgates of cross-border opportunity, Singhi pivoted. The firm rebranded as Singhi Advisors and doubled down on M&A\u2014a bold move that transformed it from a generalist player to a niche powerhouse. For marketers, this is a masterclass in brand focus. While others diversified, Singhi specialized. They aligned their messaging, capabilities, and culture around one promise: 'Where Deals Get Done'. What started as a tagline evolved into a brand truth\u2014reinforced by over 1,000 strategic transactions. Singhi didn't rely on traditional marketing to build its name. No splashy campaigns. No heavy ad spends. Instead, the firm grew through reputation marketing\u2014referrals, repeat business, and relationships. Over time, its name became synonymous with precision execution in mid-market M&A, especially in complex, cross-border deals. Still, the brand wasn't static. It adapted. As storytelling became central to B2B engagement, Singhi began embracing digital platforms to showcase thought leadership\u2014crafting content that not only informs but resonates with the C-suite. What truly sets Singhi Advisors apart is its evolved brand identity. The firm is now positioning itself as more than a dealmaker\u2014it's becoming 'The Deal Factory'. Think of it as a B2B brand ecosystem: a place where insight meets execution, where process, expertise, and trust converge to create repeatable value for clients. From project advisory ('From Concept to Commissioning') to strategic turnaround initiatives ('Revitalizing Business Potential') and global dealmaking ('Connecting Businesses Beyond Borders'), the firm has built sub-brands that reinforce its credibility and differentiate its capabilities. Singhi\u2019s recent expansion into Pune and Ahmedabad, with Hyderabad on the horizon, reflects more than operational scale\u2014it signals strategic intent. Even more telling is the firm\u2019s exploration of launching a global buyout fund\u2014a move that shifts its brand from pure advisor to potential capital partner. For marketers, it's a shift from service provider to strategic enabler. Three brand pillars anchor Singhi's identity: knowledge, trust, and conviction. These values don't just decorate the website\u2014they guide how the firm shows up in every pitch, deal, and client relationship. That's brand authenticity in action. And while many firms measure success in numbers, Singhi takes a more strategic view: long-term value creation. Every deal isn't just a close\u2014it's a chapter in a client's growth story. That's how Singhi Advisors has managed to stay relevant, trusted, and respected in an increasingly transactional space."

Amazon and Samara Capital-owned food and grocery supermarket chain More Retail is planning a \u20b92,000 crore initial public offering (IPO) in the next 12-18 months, said managing director Vinod Nambiar.

The balance 1 per cent is held by high net worth individuals and family offices through holding company More Consumer Brands. 'Both Samara and Amazon believe in the asset, and they want to build the business long term,' said Nambiar. He said proceeds from the public issue will be used to fund network expansion and to retire a large part of debt. 'More Retail has plans to expand its 775 store network to 3,000 stores by 2030 and halve its debt from Rs 500 crore as of today by the time it will go public,' he said. More Retail's current debt is a mix of term loans and non-commercial borrowings. Nambiar said the business is not capital intensive as it takes about \u20b930 lakh for setting up a supermarket since the real estate is taken on lease. Nambiar said Amazon and Samara have together infused \u20b9900 crore in the company in the last five years, which was used mostly to trim losses. The company recently raised another \u20b9150 crore by selling 1 per cent stake to family offices in the last two months. More Retail recorded sales of \u20b94,985 crore in 2024-25, growing 14 per cent from the year before. About a quarter of sales came from online since the company is the preferred seller for Amazon's grocery retail venture in India, Amazon Fresh. The company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (Ebitda) loss narrowed sharply to \u20b965 crore last fiscal from \u20b9260 crore in FY23. This fiscal, it expects to post an Ebitda profit of \u20b960 crore, Nambiar said. 'In about two years, we expect to be net profit positive. We should not lose cash from the operations. This fiscal, we are also targeting \u20b96,000 crore revenue,' he said. More Retail has rationalised its store network by shutting unprofitable stores and exiting markets like Maharashtra including Mumbai, New Delhi and Indore. It also exited from lifestyle categories to focus only on food and grocery. The company has a presence in South India, Punjab, Haryana, Gurugram and Noida, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh. It plans to enter Jharkhand and Odisha this year."

            "text": "Britannia managing director and vice chairman Varun Berry on Monday said demand recovery is unlikely to follow a sharp 'hockey stick' trend but improve gradually and continue till next year. He said the revival process has begun already. Speaking at an analysts' call to discuss quarterly earnings, Berry noted that this fiscal year should be a 'test' of both revenue and volume growth for the biscuit and dairy product maker. 'So, we are hoping that we will be able to grow revenue and volumes,' he said. 'Obviously, there will be a delta because we have taken a pretty high price increase in the last quarter, and we will be necessitated to take slightly more price increases to make sure that we deal with the inflation which comes in. But having said that, we are hoping to see healthy growth, both volume as well as revenue.' For about two fiscals, large FMCG companies have been reporting price hike-led revenue growth in an inflationary environment while volume or unit sales remained under stress as consumers either cut back on spending or purchased cheaper smaller brands. Senior executives at Hindustan Unilever, Tata Consumer Products, and Marico mentioned in recent earnings calls that demand recovery will take some time due to persistent inflation but is definitely expected. For Britannia, volume growth has been reasonably good compared to revenue, even in the last two years, Berry said. He, however, added the company may not need further price hikes with some remnants of the last price increase having already passed on to the first two months of this quarter."

            "text": "With one of the youngest entrepreneur bases in Asia-Pacific, India\u2019s SME sector is well-positioned to drive sustained growth and innovation, says the 2025 edition of the Asia-Pacific Small Business Survey. Rising costs continue to be a challenge for many small businesses, with 40% of MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises) respondents citing increasing expenses as their biggest concern, according to a survey by the professional accounting body CPA Australia. The survey, which collected responses from 4,236 small businesses across 11 Asia-Pacific markets in November and December 2024, including 507 from India, found that 72% of Indian small businesses sought external funds last year; 34% cited rising costs as the primary reason for needing finance, while 32% attributed it to reasons relating to business survival. Founded in 1886, CPA Australia represents more than 175,000 members working in over 100 countries around the world. Each year, the organisation conducts research on the key trends shaping small businesses in the Asia-Pacific region. The 2025 edition of the Asia-Pacific Small Business Survey provides data to assist small business owners, advisers and policymakers in their decision-making processes. Commenting on the survey results, Prafulla Chhajed, a certified practicing accountant with CPA Australia, says that access to finance remains a critical need for small businesses in India. \u201cIn 2024, over 71% of Indian SMEs sought external funding, well above the survey average, primarily to drive business growth. While traditional banks remain the main source for 38% of respondents, there is increasing demand for faster, more flexible credit options. Encouragingly, new solutions are emerging.\u201d Chhajed adds that tailored financial products like SME-specific credit cards and government-backed initiatives, such as collateral-free loans of up to Rs 100 crore for MSMEs under the Union Budget 2024-25, are improving access to capital. Financial literacy, he says, remains an essential component. \u201cFinancial inclusion now is no longer just about access to capital; it is also about ensuring small businesses have the knowledge, tools, and support to grow confidently and sustainably,\u201d he states. Among the small businesses that sought external funding last year, 43% indicated that obtaining financing was easy or very easy. This trend is expected to continue this year, with 39% expecting smooth access to finance. Among other highlights, the survey showed that India\u2019s small businesses continue to be among the most focused on innovation. Chhajed states that nearly 80% of businesses are planning to launch new products, services, or processes in 2025, and a sharp increase is being seen in investment in technologies like AI. \u201cWith one of the youngest entrepreneur bases in the region, India\u2019s SME sector is well-positioned to drive sustained growth and innovation. Overall, these trends highlight a forward-thinking, growth-oriented sector that is not only embracing new technologies but also focusing on scalability, job creation and global expansion,\u201d he highlights. Another notable finding is the strong hiring trend. In 2024, 46% of Indian small businesses reported increasing the size of their workforce, making them the leading job creators among the surveyed Asia-Pacific markets. An even better result is expected this year, with 64% planning to hire more employees, well above the survey average of 45%. People remain a key asset for India\u2019s small businesses, with good staff emerging as their most influential positive factor in 2024. India also has a high proportion of small business owners or leaders under 40, and younger entrepreneurs are more likely to be running businesses that are growing and creating new jobs, it stated. The survey also reflected how the technology uptake by Indian small businesses is consistent with the Asia-Pacific average. According to the survey, 26% of such businesses heavily invested in AI in the past year. This shift is enabling them to optimise operations, enhance customer experiences, and streamline processes. Additionally, over 83% of these businesses now generate more than 10% of their revenue through digital, online, or mobile payments, and more than 86% are using social media for business purposes. \u201cAdopting AI is critical for SMEs to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving market. It helps businesses automate tasks, make data-driven decisions, and create more personalised customer interactions\u2014key advantages in today\u2019s fast-paced, tech-driven economy. However, with greater digital integration comes increased exposure to cybersecurity risks. The survey revealed that 43% of SMEs still reported financial or time losses due to cyber incidents. This highlights the need for businesses to strengthen their cybersecurity measures,\u201d Chhajed cautions. On the bright side, the survey stated that India\u2019s small business sector is one of the most dynamic and optimistic in the Asia-Pacific. Survey findings revealed that 78% of Indian small businesses grew last year, reflecting the country\u2019s strong post-pandemic recovery. \u201cThis momentum has been driven by a vibrant business environment and a strong emphasis on innovation and rapid digital transformation,\u201d Chhajed emphasises."

            "text": "AI, digital skilling, and sustainability are reshaping CSR which is now a strategic imperative, and not a side activity, says Nasscom Foundation CEO, Jyoti Sharma. Integrating AI, data analytics, and digital solutions can expand access to education, boost workforce upskilling, advance healthcare, and accelerate climate action\u2014setting new benchmarks for tech-driven social good. Nasscom Foundation, along with Nasscom and BOD Consulting, released a CSR report titled \u201cTech Industry and CSR: Insights and Impactful Stories,\u201d highlighting the sector\u2019s evolving role in impactful CSR. The report states that India\u2019s tech industry contributed Rs 5,443 crore in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) spending in FY23, with companies going beyond the 2% mandate by leveraging technological expertise, scalability, and structured CSR strategies to drive long-term impact. Today, tech companies are embedding AI, digital skilling, and sustainability into their CSR strategies. Initiatives include setting up digital infrastructures, integrating AI tools for real-time monitoring, skill-based volunteering and employing AI-based skill assessments. These efforts aim to build smart, scalable systems that support skill development, entrepreneurship, and employability, particularly among rural youth and women. By prioritizing access to technology and innovation, tech companies are bridging gaps in aspirational districts, improving access to essential services like healthcare, education, and agriculture. Failing to leverage technology effectively could hinder scalability and systemic change, as it has become an indispensable catalyst for sustainable, inclusive progress and a cornerstone of India's digital future. ET: CSR impact is often amplified through collaboration. How are you working with tech companies, government bodies, and local NGOs to drive holistic development? JS: I believe that effective CSR hinges on collaboration among tech companies, government bodies, and local NGOs. At Nasscom Foundation, our core philosophy of TechForGood drives us to harness technology for inclusive growth and sustainable development. This shift from isolated efforts to co-created, scalable models enhances outcomes and aligns with goals of inclusive growth and digital empowerment. In FY23, 75 leading tech companies spearheaded over 2,610 CSR projects, investing Rs 5,443 crore\u2014surpassing the mandated 2% of profits. These initiatives focused on education, climate action, and digital skilling, leveraging AI and digital platforms to reach millions and create sustainable pathways. Collaboration with the government aligns CSR with national objectives like digital inclusion and skilling, helping bridge regional disparities. Government-backed platforms like the Aspirational Districts Programme have seen a fivefold increase in CSR investment between FY19 and FY23. However, these districts, housing over 15% of India's population, still receive only about 2.15% of total CSR funds. Local NGOs contribute essential community insights and last-mile connectivity, enhanced by capacity-building initiatives and skill-based volunteering from the tech sector. Such multi-stakeholder collaboration amplifies the impact. Strengthening public-private partnerships, fostering regional collaborations, and creating platforms for knowledge sharing can further align CSR efforts with national development goals. Promoting technology-driven collaboration and structured engagement among companies, NGOs, and government bodies will help scale impact, address region-specific challenges, and ensure efficient, inclusive use of CSR resources. ET: How have you seen the CSR ecosystem evolve over the past decade, especially from a tech industry lens? Achyuta Ghosh (AG): While India\u2019s CSR landscape has evolved, key challenges persist\u2014particularly in equitable geographic distribution, prioritising aspirational districts, and fostering stronger NGO partnerships. Our 2024 CSR survey revealed that 21% of companies struggle with limited collaboration, 20% face hurdles in expanding into new sectors, and 15% find it difficult to identify suitable implementation partners. Addressing these gaps is essential to unlocking CSR\u2019s full potential and aligning it more closely with national development goals. CSR in India has transformed over the past decade, empowering millions, with the tech industry leading the way. The number of participating companies increased by 22% from 19,888 in FY22 to 24,392 in FY23, while total CSR expenditure grew by 12.6% from Rs 26,400 crores to Rs 29,700 crores. This growth, fueled by stronger policies, reflects a deeper commitment to nation-building and the SDGs. Key trends include education, skill development, livelihoods, and climate change as top focus areas, impacting over 6.5 crore lives in FY23. Notably, CSR spending in aspirational districts has increased fivefold since FY19, though it still accounts for only 4.5% of total CSR expenditure. Encouragingly, 41% of organizations now prioritize alignment with national priorities and the SDGs. Looking ahead, social innovation is projected to increase from 6% to 8% focus in the next 3\u20135 years. ET: What do you see as the emerging priorities for the future of CSR in India, and what gaps need to be addressed to make CSR efforts more impactful and inclusive? JS: I find it encouraging that CSR investments are becoming more strategic and aligned with national and global development goals. Still, organizations must better assess community needs and identify high-impact areas. In the coming years, skill development and livelihood generation are expected to surpass education as CSR priorities. Tech companies are entering areas like disaster response and WASH, while non-tech firms focus more on climate action. Social innovation is gaining ground, with focus expected to grow from 6% to 8%. Despite progress, companies face barriers in collaboration, sector expansion, and finding the right partners. On-the-ground challenges like tech resistance, fragmented gender efforts, and caste-based discrimination persist. A long-term, partnership-driven, tech-enabled approach is essential for deeper, inclusive impact. ET: Based on the report, what recommendations would you give to CSR leaders? AG: The report outlines key recommendations for CSR leaders aiming to replicate successful initiatives. It emphasizes establishing clear key performance indicators (KPIs) and leveraging AI tools for real-time monitoring to enable timely course corrections. Developing adaptive learning solutions tailored to diverse demographics, incorporating gamification and practical simulations, is highlighted to sustain engagement. Collaborating with academic and industry stakeholders to create impactful training programs ensures certifications align with industry standards, attracting participation. Partnering with local NGOs addresses regional talent issues effectively. Providing regional language content and mobile or offline learning resources bridges accessibility gaps. Combining technical and soft skills training, and utilizing case studies, offers clear career pathways for learners. Engaging with local organizations fosters effective outreach, builds trust, and allows for the customization of program goals to address community-specific challenges. Involving local outreach workers and leaders in a community-driven model ensures sustained behavioral change and program adoption. Partnering with organizations that possess local expertise helps bridge gaps in reach, logistics, and program execution. ET: How has the rise of professionalized CSR teams and strategic alignment within the tech industry contributed to more efficient, impactful initiatives\u2014particularly in areas like tech-led skilling and sustainable rural development? JS: I have observed a significant shift in how we approach social responsibility. CSR is no longer a peripheral activity; it is now a strategic imperative that aligns closely with our business objectives and national development goals. This evolution has enabled us to leverage our technological expertise to address pressing social and environmental challenges effectively. According to the Nasscom and Nasscom Foundation Annual CSR Survey 2024, 90% of tech-integrated projects reported increased impact, scalability, and efficiency. Furthermore, 41% of organizations are now prioritizing CSR goals that align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, reflecting our collective commitment to global societal advancement. It's clear that by embedding technology into our CSR strategies, we are not only driving meaningful change, but also setting a precedent for sustainable and inclusive growth."

            "text": "Homegrown defence and drone startups are seeing a surge in demand as the conflict with Pakistan spurs the Indian military to further bolster its arsenal. India needs to achieve scale by activating its manufacturing and engineering capabilities, instead of relying on foreign suppliers, according to the startups. Industry experts pointed to Israel developing advanced defence technologies arising from necessity due to conflicts, later benefiting from large export orders. India hasn't faced the same urgency so far, but stakeholders need to collaborate when the country's sovereignty is threatened, they emphasised. \"Capacities cannot be built in a day. During peacetime, people do realise the importance of building a military-industrial complex, but it often comes too late. Warfare has changed, and technology is now absolutely critical,\" said Vishal Saxena, vice president at ideaForge Technology, a drone manufacturer. He added that relying on foreign technology is a vulnerability during critical times in today's battlefield. IdeaForge's drone solutions--built for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission--have been deployed in 'Operation Sindoor'. The startup placed on ground team to make any upgrades and support the military during the conflict. Industry stakeholders highlighted that the current geopolitical scenario has brought to fore the inefficiencies of relying on expensive missiles to defend against low-cost drone threats. \"The unit economics of using a \u20b92.5 crore missile to take down a \u20b925,000 drone don't work. Our counter-drone technology aims to bring down the cost to below \u20b910 lakh, by using drones to take down other drones instead of using missiles,\" said Santosh Balajee Banisetty, founder of Zebu Intelligence Systems. Experts say identifying five core manufacturers and aligning them with upstream suppliers can aid in addressing capacity issues. Banks also need to provide working capital through confirmed orders, they suggest. Prof Satya Chakravarthy, who teaches aerospace engineering at IIT Madras, and founded The ePlane Company-a maker of eVOLT all-electric air taxi and drones-said he has received multiple inquiries from current and ex-defence personnel as well as defence-linked companies."

            "text": "HomeSports NewsWho is leading the Indian Test captaincy race for tour of England? Former spinner makes an interesting pick Former Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has put his weight behind seasoned pacer Jasprit Bumrah to take over captaincy responsibilities in the Indian Test team, starting from the upcoming five-match-long tour of England. Ashwin, who hung his boots from international cricket in December last year, spoke on his YouTube show about Bumrah being the most experienced asset in the team after the retirements of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, whilst asserting that the speedster deserves the honour of leading the national team in red ball cricket. Ashwin further added that the tour of England will actually mark the beginning of Gautam Gambhir\u2019s era as the Indian head coach, given that a completely new-look side is set to embark on a difficult challenge against the Ben Stokes-led side. Also read | After Test retirement, when will Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma play next for India? \u201cThe team that will tour England will be a completely new team, a transformed team where Bumrah will probably be the senior-most player. He is obviously one of the captaincy options; I think he deserves the captaincy, but the selectors will take a decision based on his physical capacity,\u201d Ashwin said. He added, \u201cTheir retirements will definitely create a leadership vacuum. You can't buy experience, especially on tours like this. Virat's energy and Rohit's composure will be missed.\u201d So far, there have been reports suggesting that Bumrah will not be considered for a leadership role in England given his patchy fitness off late. After injuring his back in Sydney earlier this year, the pacer stayed out of competitive cricketing action for over three months before returning to action in the Indian Premier League (IPL) for Mumbai Indians. Also read | BCCI to retain Grade A+ contract for Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma despite Test retirement He was the vice-captain in the tour Down Under, where India suffered a 3-1 loss. He captained the side to victory in the opening Test in Perth and was the stand-in skipper in the final game in Sydney. However, his troublesome back means that the selectors have to be wary of overexposing him in the longest format. Bumrah\u2019s former coach at MI, Shane Bond, spoke before IPL 2025 that the Indian star\u2019s injury concerns are pretty similar to the one that the Kiwi endured during his playing days. Bond warned that another back injury could mark the end of Bumrah\u2019s career, drawing parallels to that of his own, since he stopped playing at 34. As of now, Shubman Gill is considered to be the frontrunner to take over leadership duties from Rohit Sharma. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) might do a press conference to unveil Gill as the new captain. Rishabh Pant could be his deputy as the team expects a fresh change in the think-tank to begin the new World Test Championship (WTC) 2025-27 cycle. \u201cTests has been the finest [format for India] in the last 10-12 years, but just for the sake of leadership, Rohit should've played till the England series, and if he'd performed, he could've carried on and given some more leadership,\u201d Ashwin added. India\u2019s squad for the England series is likely to be announced in Mumbai on May 23. The India A roster that will tour the country for a couple of unofficial Test matches shall be declared within a few days\u2019 time."

Benchmark Nifty 50 index opened Wednesday's session with a positive bias, gaining 35 points on the back of supportive global cues. The index continued its upward momentum during the first hour of trading. However, profit booking at higher levels led to a sharp intraday decline of over 200 points from the day's peak of 24,767. Financials underperformed, with the Nifty Bank index closing in the red. The Nifty Bank index fell 140 points to end at 54,801. Buying continued in defence names, with stocks rising up to 15%. Shares of state-run defence equipment manufacturer Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. rose following its March quarter numbers. REC Ltd. slipped 3% as the company cut its growth guidance for its Assets Under Management (AUM) during its earnings call on Wednesday, May 14. REC now expects its AUM to grow between 11% and 13% from 15% and 17% projected earlier. Mumbai-based drugmaker Cipla Ltd ., a Nifty 50 constituent, has warned in its earnings call that its margins for financial year 2026 and 2027 will be lower than current levels as a key drug fully phases out. In response, the stock fell 2%. On the earnings front, quarterly results from LIC Housing Finance, JSW Energy, Cochin Shipyard, Godrej Industries, Patanjali Foods, INOX India, Kaynes Technology, Irm Energy, Balrampur Chini Mills, and ITC Hotels are expected to drive stock-specific action on Thursday's trading session, which will also be the weekly options expiry day. Additionally, stocks like Eicher Motors, Tata Power, Cipla, among others will also be in the spotlight tomorrow, as these companies reported their Q4 numbers after market hours on Wednesday. Siddhartha Khemka of Motilal Oswal said the positive momentum in Indian markets is likely to persist, supported by easing geopolitical tensions, progress on trade agreements, and improving signs of macroeconomic stability. The bullish trend is well intact for Nifty as it has been holding its level above all key moving averages, said Nandish Shah of HDFC Securities. \"On the downside, strong supports for Nifty are placed at 24,500 and 24,378, while on the upsides 24,850 and 24,975 could offer resistance.\" According to Rupak De of LKP Securities, the Nifty traded within a narrow range today, following two days of high volatile moves. The short-term trend remains positive, as the index continues to remain above critical moving average. After a sharp rally, this sideways movement appears to be a healthy consolidation, suggesting the market is catching its breath before the next move. The analyst said that as long as the Nifty stays above the crucial support level of 24,400, the bulls are likely to maintain their grip. In the near term, the index might move towards the 24,850\u201325,000 range. However, a drop below 24,400 could delay this upward trajectory and lead to further consolidation."

            "text": "HomeIndia NewsCAIT urges nationwide travel boycott of Turkey and Azerbaijan over Pakistan support The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), representing Indian traders nationwide, has urged citizens to boycott travel to Turkey and Azerbaijan due to their support for Pakistan amid current hostilities. The organization plans to intensify its efforts by coordinating with travel operators and other stakeholders. Meanwhile, a final decision on suspending trade with Turkey and Azerbaijan will be made at a national conference of leading trade representatives, scheduled for May 16 in New Delhi. CAIT\u2019s Secretary General and Member of Parliament, Praveen Khandelwal, emphasised the economic impact a travel boycott could have on these nations, particularly in their tourism sectors. Citing 2024 data, he highlighted that Turkey received 62.2 million foreign tourists, including approximately 300,000 Indians\u2014an increase of 20.7% over 2023. With a total tourism revenue of $61.1 billion, Indian tourists alone contributed an estimated $291.6 million, spending an average of $972 per person. If Indian tourists stop traveling to Turkey, the nation could face a direct revenue loss of nearly $291.6 million, exacerbated by canceled weddings, corporate events, and cultural programs. Regarding Azerbaijan, Khandelwal noted that in 2024, the country welcomed about 2.6 million foreign visitors, 250,000 of whom were Indians. With an average spending of 2,170 AZN (approximately $1,276), Indian tourists contributed around $308.6 million. A large-scale decline in tourism from India could slow down the leisure, entertainment, and adventure sectors in Azerbaijan. The economic pressure from such a boycott, he said, might compel Turkey and Azerbaijan to reconsider their stance toward India. Reduced travel would also impact local businesses like hotels, restaurants, and tour operators in these countries. CAIT has formally urged Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and Consumer Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi to prohibit the sale of Pakistani flags and merchandise on e-commerce platforms nationwide. In their appeal, the organization emphasized the need to prevent the circulation of such items, aligning with broader efforts to limit commercial engagement with Pakistan. While our armed forces are engaged in #OperationSindoor, Pakistani flags & merchandise are being sold on Indian e-commerce platforms CAIT has written to Union Ministers @PiyushGoyal & @JoshiPralhad demanding an IMMEDIATE BAN on such items being sold on\u2026 pic.twitter.com/9PF5EMLi7p \u2014 Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) (@CAITIndia) May 13, 2025 The rising tensions between India and Turkey have fueled widespread online outrage, following Turkey\u2019s criticism of India\u2019s military strikes on terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). On May 7, the Turkish foreign minister issued a warning, suggesting India\u2019s actions could escalate into a wider conflict\u2014a statement that quickly drew backlash from Indian citizens and officials alike. The controversy deepened when Indian authorities confirmed that drones shot down near the border were of Turkish origin. Allegedly deployed from Pakistani territory, these drones raised suspicions of Turkish support for Pakistan\u2019s military operations. In response to these developments, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has reinforced demands for a firm travel and economic boycott, pushing for decisive action against Turkey and Azerbaijan.

Jagbir Singh, Chief Technology Officer at Vodafone Idea, said the 5G launch in Delhi is part of the company's network modernisation efforts. Andres Vicente, Head of Ericsson Southeast Asia, Oceania and India, said the launch reflects ongoing collaboration between the two companies. Ericsson currently supports live 5G networks in 77 countries and continues to expand its infrastructure portfolio.

            "text": "HomeMarket NewsEarnings NewsTata Motors eyes modest but stable FY26 growth across segments, confident on EVs Tata Motors expects modest but stable demand in the domestic market going into FY26, said PB Balaji, CFO of the company, a day after the automaker reported a strong March quarter profit beat. \u201cOverall, the demand situation as far as India is concerned is modest, is decent; at the same time, there are no major concerns at this point. I would expect modest growth this year,\u201d Balaji told CNBC-TV18. The company, which manufactures commercial and passenger vehicles and owns the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) brand, reported a net profit of \u20b98,470 crore for the March quarter, well above estimates. While revenue came in slightly below expectations at \u20b91.19 lakh crore, EBITDA at \u20b916,992 crore and margins of 14.2% were better than analyst forecasts. Balaji said the outlook for the commercial vehicle segment remains positive, backed by steady freight rates, supportive interest and fuel prices, and robust government capex. \u201cThe underlying fundamentals of growth are very much intact\u2026 even the government\u2019s investment plan continues to remain strong,\u201d he noted. Though timing the next cycle is difficult, the company sees no medium- to long-term concerns for commercial vehicle demand. Tata Motors market share Balaji described last year as \u201cmuted\u201d and called it a \u201cyear of consolidation\u201d on the passenger vehicle front. He pointed out that Tata Motors retained a 13.2% market share, often ranking second in the market. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a market share loss issue. It\u2019s more about how we grow market share from here on,\u201d he said, adding that a fresh product launch cycle and improvements in service network capacity should drive growth going forward. The company is gearing up with a strong product pipeline in the passenger vehicle segment. \u201cWe now have an intensive product launch pipeline starting, and we have more or less fixed the service capacity issues,\u201d Balaji said. Both factors, he added, should boost customer sentiment and help the company grow faster than the market. Tata Motors EV market share On the electric vehicle (EV) front, where Tata Motors commands a 55% market share, Balaji dismissed the need for a strategic rethink despite increasing competition. \u201cWe just need to execute with speed,\u201d he said. The company\u2019s near-term EV focus is on expanding penetration rather than protecting market share, especially in the wake of challenges in the fleet segment after the withdrawal of FAME subsidies. Tata Motors plans to cater to a broader EV customer base with what Balaji called the \u201cwidest range in the market,\u201d from the affordable Tiago EV to the upcoming Harrier EV. \u201cThis kind of wide portfolio with multiple range offerings helps us cater to different customer segments effectively,\u201d he said."

The company is targeting over 30% year-on-year growth in revenue for the fiscal. In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Global CEO Ashish Rai said with the continued investments in product development and market expansion, particularly into Europe and Southeast Asia, Aurionpro expects to maintain its growth pace in FY26. Q: Most large IT companies this quarter mentioned that clients have turned cautious. They\u2019re in a wait-and-watch mode. It\u2019s still early days, just a couple of days since the US-China tariff easing, but what have you been hearing from clients on the ground? We\u2019re already 45 days into the first quarter of FY26. What\u2019s the feedback? A: We are not really that much affected by what goes on in the US. First of all, 90% of our business is in Asia: India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa. And the demand environment has been fairly strong. The second part of it is that we are in spaces where you\u2019re going through a bit of a demand supercycle, almost. On the banking side, we see the move away from custom software, which is very legacy, into buying out mature enterprise software that brings in best practices in the spaces we are in\u2014transaction banking, lending. We've never seen a demand environment so strong. Similarly, on the transit side, the movement from closed loop to open loop is massive globally. So again, a very strong demand cycle. So overall, from a demand environment perspective, the pipeline and win rates are strong. We\u2019ve built out products that have proven to be very competitive. So, we\u2019ll keep accelerating at the pace we\u2019ve been on for the last few years. Q: Margins in FY25 were 20.6% versus 22% in FY24. So there was a margin compression of 140 basis points. Looking back, what are the three key reasons for this? And what can you guide on margins going ahead? A: We are growing or investing at a very fast pace. And most of our investments are actually expenses, because we don\u2019t capitalise much. Most of that buildout, expanding into newer geographies like Europe, is a huge bet for us this year. We\u2019ve been investing close to \u20b960-70 crore in that. We\u2019ll operate within a 2% band. 20% is about the level we feel comfortable with. Q: In terms of numbers, will there be a downward bias? FY26 margins should be closer to 20%\u2014not the 20\u201322% margin band you operated in last year? A: Yeah, I think so. There may be some pressure for a couple of quarters as we expand into Europe, which was very close to zero last year. This year, we expect it to climb up to at least 7\u20138% of revenue. That means a significant investment in building out a sales team and products. In terms of growth, we should be able to grow at 30% plus on both revenue and earnings. Q: At the end of the third quarter, your order book was around \u20b91,300 crore. What is the kind of pipeline that you're looking at? A: The order book now stands at about more than \u20b91,400 crore. We don't really declare multi-year orders. Most of the order book for us is executable over the next four to six quarters. Every quarter we consume from the same order book and add to it. The incremental \u20b9110-odd crore addition is a pretty significant thing in a quarter. Most of it will get consumed in FY26 and that gives us a lot of confidence in terms of the demand outlook for FY26. Pipeline is at least 60% larger than when we entered FY25. The demand pipeline is something we've not seen before. Part of the reason is the transformation spend on the banking side, which has really gone up, especially with demands around AI and almost all the banks want to catch up on the technology stack. Also, now we are in a lot more newer markets. So we've gone into Europe. Middle East is a lot stronger. Southeast Asia a lot stronger."

The move follows CoinDCX\u2019s acquisition of BitOasis in 2024 and is part of a wider strategy to increase international revenue. BitOasis will operate in Bahrain under a Crypto-Asset Services Licence issued by the Central Bank of Bahrain. CoinDCX expects more than 30% of its total revenue to come from the MENA region by 2026, up from the current 20%. Sumit Gupta, Co-Founder of CoinDCX, said the company's expansion in the region is influenced by regulatory clarity, growing investor interest, and the size of high-net-worth individual investment flows. According to Gupta, BitOasis has seen fourfold revenue growth since the acquisition. The Bahrain platform will offer services to retail, corporate, and institutional clients. New features include premium services for high-net-worth individuals and support for local bank transfers across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). BitOasis Co-Founder and CEO Ola Doudin said the Bahrain launch represents a continuation of the company\u2019s regional growth plans. CoinDCX\u2019s technology team now manages the backend infrastructure of the platform. The move comes amid increased activity in the MENA virtual assets sector, supported by regulatory initiatives and investment in blockchain infrastructure across the region. The market is also shaped by a young population and high levels of internet penetration. According to data from IMARC Consulting, the GCC crypto market was valued at $744.3 million in 2024 and is projected to reach $3.5 billion by 2033, with an annual growth rate of 16.75%. Around 38% of crypto users in the region have annual incomes above $15,000. BitOasis has processed more than $7.4 billion in trading volume since its founding in 2016 and has raised over $40 million in funding. The Bahrain launch follows the platform securing a Virtual Asset Service Provider licence from Dubai\u2019s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority in December 2024."

I then stopped fighting back as I was in a lot of pain.\u201d Bailey included photos of her tooth and bruises on her arms in her filing. In March, she said Granberry entered her house when she wasn\u2019t home and texted her a photo of her bed along with a threatening message suggesting she was having sex with other men. A few days later, she said, he berated her when she did not want to send their sick baby on a visit with him, and smashed the Ring camera on her porch when he realised it was recording the confrontation. She said when she called a relative for help, he took her phone and got into his car, slamming the door on her as she was holding the baby. Bailey filed a police report over the incident.

Now, all eyes are finally turning to Istanbul to seek an end to Russia\u2019s 3-year-old, full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed restarting direct peace talks with Ukraine in the Turkish city that straddles Asia and Europe. And President Volodymyr Zelensky challenged the Kremlin leader to meet in Turkey in person. What will unfold remains unclear. The Kremlin has refused to confirm who\u2019s going to Turkey and whether it will include Putin. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Zelensky will only sit down with the Russian leader. Zelensky said Tuesday (May 13) that \u201cif Putin does not arrive and plays games, it is the final point that he does not want to end the war.\u201d What\u2019s known about the possible talks: On Saturday (May 10), Zelensky hosted French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk in a show of unity. They issued a coordinated call for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine starting Monday (May 12).

The leaders pledged tougher sanctions on Russia if Putin did not accept the proposal. In remarks to the media early Sunday (May 11), however, Putin effectively rejected the offer and proposed restarting direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul instead \u201cwithout preconditions.\u201d He did not specify whether he envisioned the talks to involve Zelensky and himself personally, or with lower-level officials. Zelensky responded by insisting on a ceasefire, saying he will travel to Turkey \u2014 and challenged Putin to do the same: \u201cI will be waiting for Putin in (Turkey) on Thursday (May 15). Personally. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses.\u201d Pressed by reporters on who will represent Russia in Istanbul, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to say, stressing that Putin had outlined Russia\u2019s position clearly enough. Trump\u2019s administration initiated separate talks with Russia and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia in March. But since then, the administration has indicated it might withdraw from the process if no tangible progress is made. Trump said on Monday (May 12) he was optimistic about the talks \u2014 a sharp contrast to a contentious Oval Office meeting with Zelensky on Feb. 28. Read more: Putin proposes direct peace talks with Ukraine after three years of war There is \u201cthe potential for a good meeting\u201d between Putin and Zelensky, Trump said in Washington. He added he was \u201cthinking about flying over\u201d after his visit to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates but later said Secretary of State Marco Rubio and others from the U.S. will go to Turkey for the talks. Podolyak on Tuesday (May 13) told a YouTube broadcast by prominent Russian journalists in exile that the Ukrainian leader won\u2019t be meeting any Russian officials in Istanbul other than Putin. He added that \u201cthere are always people\u201d in Zelensky\u2019s entourage who can \u201cconduct certain negotiations at corresponding levels\u201d with the Russians but questioned the point of a lower-level meeting. \u201cUndoubtedly, only Putin can make the decision to continue the war or stop the war,\u201d he said. Zelensky said Tuesday (May 13) he will meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the capital Ankara, and wait there. If the Russian leader chooses Istanbul for the meeting, Zelensky said, then he and Erdogan will travel there. If Putin doesn\u2019t show, European and U.S. leaders should follow through with additional sanctions against Russia, he added. The Kremlin billed Thursday\u2019s (May 15) talks as a \u201crestarting\u201d of peace negotiations in Istanbul in 2022, early on in the war, that quickly fell apart. Moscow had blamed Ukraine and the West for their alleged desire to continue fighting, while Kyiv said Russia\u2019s demands amounted to an ultimatum rather than something the sides could mutually agree on. Read more: Zelenskyy ready to meet Putin in Turkey; hopes for ceasefire with Russia ahead of planned talks Zelensky has said the Russian delegation\u2019s demands included Ukraine\u2019s recognition of Russian control over the Donbas, an area in eastern Ukraine consisting of Donetsk and Luhansk regions; constitutional amendments to declare neutrality; a significant reduction of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces; and the surrender of long-range weaponry. \u201cThere were never any negotiations; it was an ultimatum from a murderer,\u201d he said in 2022. Putin accused Ukraine of derailing a peace deal that was basically agreed on and included clauses of Ukraine\u2019s neutral and nonnuclear status and details on how much its army would be reduced. \"The Kyiv authorities \u2026 just threw it all away. They turned it down,\u201d Putin said in 2023. The Kremlin has said repeatedly \u201cthe Istanbul agreements\u201d could serve as a basis for further peace talks. After Moscow illegally annexed the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in September 2022, Russian authorities started saying that Kyiv should also recognize \u201cthe reality on the ground.\u201d Putin last year demanded that Ukraine cede the four regions, which it still does not fully control. He also wants Kyiv to recognise the Crimean Peninsula, also illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014, as Russian; Ukraine also must renounce its bid to join NATO and drastically reduce its army. He also demanded that the West lift sanctions imposed on Moscow after the invasion. Kyiv, in turn, refused to cede any land and wants robust security guarantees against future Russian aggression. Trump, who has engaged in a broad diplomatic effort to end the war since taking office, has said that Crimea, \u201cwill stay with Russia.\u201d He has also said that Kyiv was unlikely to ever join NATO.

The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said Russia is \u201cquickly replenishing front-line units with new recruits to maintain the battlefield initiative.\u201d In 2024 and more recently, Russian troops have made slow but steady gains in several sections along the front. Putin said in March that Russian troops have \u201cgained steam\u201d and \u201care holding strategic initiative all along the line of contact.\u201d Zelensky warned that Russia was delaying talks in preparation for bigger offensives. Last month, Moscow\u2019s forces also declared that they fully reclaimed chunks of Russia\u2019s Kursk region bordering Ukraine that Kyiv\u2019s forces seized in a surprise incursion in August 2024. Kyiv denied the claim, but it has been steadily losing ground there as Moscow, aided by North Korean soldiers, worked to push them out and leave Ukraine without a key negotiating chip. Several attempts to establish at least a partial ceasefire have been unsuccessful. Russia effectively rejected a 30-day unconditional truce; the Kremlin instead declared two short, unilateral ceasefires for holidays in the last two months - one for 30 hours at Easter and another for 72 hours to coincide with Russia\u2019s World War II Victory Day celebrations. In both cases, Kyiv and Moscow accused each other of failing to halt the fighting. Russia and Ukraine also pledged in March to observe a 30-day halt to attacking energy infrastructure that was brokered by the Trump administration. Both sides repeatedly accused each other of massive violations until the measure expired. RussiaRussia Ukraine TensionsRussia-Ukraine warTurkeyUkraineunited states"

            "text": "HomeSports NewsAfter Test retirement, when will Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma play next for India? The previous week has been an eventful one for Indian cricket, as seasoned stars Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli called it a day from their Test careers. The duo had already quit playing T20Is after the World Cup final in Barbados last year, which means that two of the team\u2019s most experienced stalwarts will now represent the nation only in ODIs. Rohit has clearly stated his desire to keep playing till the ODI World Cup in 2027 during a recent interview with journalist Vimal Kumar, whereas Virat, too, is expected to follow suit since it is his strongest format where he averages 57.9 after 302 games. Rohit and Virat will be aged 40 and 38 respectively by the time of the next ODI multi-nation event, and it could arguably be a tall ask for them to sustain their fitness and form levels. A major predicament on this front is the fact that countries across the cricketing world have gradually reduced the number of ODIs that they engage in, partly due to the increased focus laid on T20Is and the latter\u2019s greater marketability too. Also read | BCCI to retain Grade A+ contract for Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma despite Test retirement Which is why, the traditional norm of five-match ODI series\u2019 have been done away with since 2019 onwards, with most of bilateral contests in the 50-overs format lasting for a maximum of three games now. Often, three-match ODI engagements are preceded or succeeded by a five-game-long T20I one, suggesting the evolving nature of international white-ball cricket. On that note, it will be a major hit for Indian cricket that Rohit and Virat won\u2019t be seen in action next till August, as they will cease to be a part of the Test squad that will engage in a marquee five-encounter series in England starting on June 20. India\u2019s next ODI series is scheduled to be held in Bangladesh, starting August 17 in Dhaka. However, there are doubts over whether that tour will take place amid the on-going tensions between the two countries. There is a possibility of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) organising another series to make up for that, but if the schedule is really done away with, then Virat and Rohit will return to play for India only in October during the ODIs in Australia. Following that, there will be another set of three 50-overs matches against South Africa at home in November-December. Also read | In pics: The next in line \u2013 5 contenders to replace Rohit Sharma in Tests However, going by the current set of fixtures, the duo will be representing India in only nine matches by the end of this year. For two players who had become almost synonymous with Indian cricket, and had propelled to become all-format regulars, it shall be a huge jolt to deal with at both an individual level and also collectively for the team. Another interesting notion to look forward to would be their ability to get back into the groove almost immediately after long-drawn breaks, as a three-match ODI series gives little time to recover form. Regardless to say, interesting times rest ahead for Indian cricket and two of its most beloved stars."

            "text": "At a time when the nation is celebrating Col Sofia Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh for their fearless service and sharp, confident press briefing that rattled Pakistan's military establishment, Madhya Pradesh BJP leader and state Tribal Affairs Minister Vijay Shah has sparked outrage with his derogatory comment targetting Col Qureshi. Shah, often in the news for all the wrong reasons, made the remark at a public gathering in Madhya Pradesh. The statement is yet another addition to his long list of offensive remarks against women. Col Qureshi, who along with Wing Commander Singh became the face of Operation Sindoor, was the latest target of Shah's verbal tirade. The Jabalpur court has taken suo motu cognisance of Shah's remarks on Col. Quershi. The court has directed the police to file an FIR against Shah under stringent sections. Following his latest comment on Col Qureshi, Shah attempted damage control by telling journalists he was willing to apologise. He claimed he would never disrespect a soldier since he belongs to a family of martyrs and servicemen. However, a fact-check by News18 India revealed that no one from Shah\u2019s family has served in the armed forces. The BJP and RSS have since reprimanded Shah for his statement. He was pulled up by state BJP president VD Sharma and state general secretary Hitanand Sharma. Party sources suggested Shah may once again be removed from his cabinet position. The Congress has taken a strong stand against Shah's comment. Several leaders have changed their display pictures on social media to Col Qureshi's photo in a show of solidarity. Protests are being planned across Harda and Madhya Pradesh. Senior Congress leader and former chief minister Digvijaya Singh condemned Shah's remarks, stating, \"The entire nation is proud of Col Sofiya and is applauding her for the way she represented the Indian Army during Operation Sindoor. But politicians like Vijay Shah are making such statements because they believe it brings them attention and promotion within their party. This is not the first time he has made a derogatory, divisive, and objectionable comment. I urge the BJP leadership to take strong action against him.\" Shah, who hails from the Harda region and claims to belong to a royal tribal family, is facing fierce backlash across the country, particularly from citizens in Madhya Pradesh, his own constituency and Harda. Various citizen groups in Harda have called for his sacking and urged all political parties to deny him future tickets. This isn't the first time that Shah has stirred controversy. In 2013, while serving as a minister in the Madhya Pradesh cabinet, he made a derogatory statement about Sadhana Singh Chauhan, wife of then Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Though reprimanded and removed from his post at the time, Shah was fielded by the BJP in subsequent elections, securing tickets in both 2018 and 2023 state polls. A sitting eight-time MLA, Shah's political career appears unaffected by his repeated misconduct. Shah has also made several objectionable remarks about Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi over the years. With inputs from Manoj Sharma, News18"

Before the selectors could announce the squad and captain for the upcoming tour of England, Kohli and Sharma brought down the curtains on red ball cricket. The retirement from Test cricket follows their earlier exit from the T20 (international) format, which they had confirmed after India lifted the 2024 T20 Cricket World Cup. Nonetheless, despite leaving two of the three formats, BCCI decided to continue their A+ contracts, considering their contribution to the game. Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma's grade A+ contract will continue even after both announced retirement from T- 20 and Test Matches. They are still part of Indian cricket, they will get all facilities of Grade A+: Secretary BCCI, Devajit Saikia to ANI \"Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma's grade A+ contract will continue even after both announced retirement from T- 20 and Test Matches. They are still part of Indian cricket, they will get all facilities of Grade A+\", Secretary BCCI, Devajit Saikia told ANI.

Although their journey in Test cricket may have ended, Rohit and Kohli remain central to India's ODI plans. They are expected to play key roles in the upcoming Champions Trophy and future bilateral ODI series. Meanwhile, England pace great James Anderson recently said that India's next generation of batters have the aggression and fearlessness to step into the \"big shoes\" of Kohli and Sharma in the Test team. Kohli and Sharma, legends of Indian batting, bid farewell to Test cricket within a week of each otherand will only feature in ODIs for India in future. Kohli ended his inspiring run in the traditional format, scoring 9230 runs from 123 matches with 30 hundreds at an average of 46.85, while Rohit accumulated 4301 runs from 67 Tests at an average of 40.57 and has 12 centuries and 18 fifties to his name. \"Great players. Kohli, one of the greatest Test batters that's ever been,\" Anderson said on 'talkSPORT'. The twin retirements mean India will not only have a new captain at the helm but will be without two of their most experienced players. \"There will be a new captain because Sharma has retired, There's big shoes to fill there but they've got a huge amount of talent in their squad,\" Anderson added. He praised the new crop of Indian batters for their attacking mindset, while concluding. (With inputs from PTI)"

Motilal Oswal Financial Services attributed the growth to gains in liquid and equity funds, boosted by market momentum. Despite the AUM high, equity inflows fell for the fourth month in a row. Investors turned cautious amid rich valuations and global uncertainty. In contrast, SIP inflows touched new highs, showing strong retail participation. Liquid, equity funds lead AUM growth AUM rose 6.5% month-on-month. Liquid funds added \u20b91.56 lakh crore, equity funds \u20b91.21 lakh crore, income funds \u20b980,800 crore, and ETFs \u20b933,500 crore. Equity AUM alone stood at \u20b933.5 lakh crore, up 3.8% from March. The Nifty gained 3.5% during the same period. Equity inflows lose steam Net equity inflows fell to \u20b925,800 crore in April, a 12-month low. Redemptions dropped 1.8% to \u20b939,800 crore. Gross equity sales declined 5% to \u20b965,600 crore. Investors likely held back due to stretched valuations or global risks. SIPs remain strong SIP inflows reached an all-time high of \u20b926,630 crore. They rose 2.7% from March and 30.7% from a year ago. This shows investors stayed committed to long-term investing despite market swings. Fund managers shift focus Mutual funds raised allocations to Private Banks, Oil & Gas, Automobiles, Consumer, and Telecom. They cut exposure to Technology, Capital Goods, NBFCs, Utilities, and Cement. Private banks saw the biggest increase. Their weight in portfolios rose to 18.9%, the highest in 20 months. HDFC Bank saw fund additions worth \u20b915,700 crore. ICICI Bank got \u20b911,820 crore, Axis Bank \u20b98,110 crore, and IndusInd Bank \u20b93,600 crore.Oil & Gas allocation rose to 6.4%, an eight-month high. Auto moved up to 8%. Technology fell to 8.3%, the third monthly cut in a row. Mid- and small-cap bets rise Funds bought 60% of Nifty Midcap 100 and 69% of Nifty Smallcap 100 stocks. Patanjali Foods, Waaree Energies, NBCC, and Delhivery saw strong inflows.In mid-caps, Tata Technologies, Hindustan Zinc, and IDFC First Bank gained favour. In small-caps, NBCC, Delhivery, Dr Lal Pathlabs, and Godfrey Phillips stood out. Top AMCs see equity gains Equity value of the top 20 AMCs rose 3.7% month-on-month and 21.7% year-on-year. Motilal Oswal MF led with a 6% jump. UTI MF and Nippon India MF gained 4.3% each. SBI MF rose 4.2%, and Axis MF 4%. Banking stocks top value additions Banks dominated fund additions in April. Siemens, Infosys, Voltas, and Bajaj Finance saw declines. This shift shows a preference for financials with stable earnings and growth visibility. \u201cFund managers are rotating towards structural growth themes,\u201d said Motilal Oswal. \u201cPrivate banks, oil & gas, and mid-cap opportunities lead the shift.\u201d Outlook stays positive Equity inflows may be cooling, but record SIPs and strategic fund rotation signal strength.

Punit Lalbhai, Vice Chairman at Anup Engineering said, \u201cWe have a very strong order book going into the year and this year is no different. We already have about 80% of the order book locked in, and we are now looking at short lead time orders to ensure that our growth will be above 25% and we should be in with that 20% plus EBITDA margin so things are on track for next year.\u201d Anup Engineering's current order book stands at around \u20b9750 crore, scheduled for delivery in FY26. The company is in advanced discussions for several large orders expected to be finalised over the next three to four months. Once secured, these orders are likely to help push topline growth beyond 25%. The business environment has been challenging, particularly in the aftermath of the general elections in India, which led to subdued order enquiries from the PSU sector. Additionally, uncertainty around US elections and tariffs has slowed activity from the American market. However, with domestic projects beginning to gain momentum again, the company is confident that just one or two more key inquiries will be enough to meet its targets for the upcoming financial year. In the January\u2013March quarter of 2025 (Q4FY25), Anup Engineering reported revenue of \u20b9204 crore, an EBITDA margin of 15.96%, and a net profit of \u20b929 crore. Anup Engineering's cash flow from operations has declined sharply\u2014from \u20b9170 crore to a negative \u20b98 crore\u2014primarily due to a \u20b9140 crore rise in trade receivables. This spike is largely attributed to one significant order that has been delayed at the customer's request, as their site is not yet ready. The company expects the situation to normalise by the July\u2013September quarter of FY26 (Q2FY26), once the order is executed and receivables are cleared.

In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Chairman and Managing Director Kuldip Singh Rathee said ASK Automotive is aiming for a 150 basis point improvement in EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation) margins to 14%. Export revenue, which currently accounts for around 4.5%, is expected to increase with new orders in the pipeline, including a \u20b975 crore order. The company plans a capex of \u20b9450 crore in FY26, largely funded through internal accruals. This is the edited transcript of the interview. Q: A two-part question: one, what's your outlook for FY26 when it comes to revenues and margins? And secondly, you were looking to increase your contribution coming from electric vehicles and exports. Where do those numbers stand right now? What's the prognosis for next year? A: This year, we have done well, as you see that the full-year profit has grown by 43%. About the next year, it also looks very positive. Why I am positive on two-wheelers is that we have still not reached the numbers that we achieved in 2018-19, though we were very close to this. I see a good year ahead, especially in view of all the macroeconomic indicators that is, the low interest rates, the tax cuts which are going to benefit the two-wheeler industry, and the forecast of good monsoons. Next year, we again expect revenue growth to be in the mid-teens. As always, we'll outperform the industry, which we have been doing for the last 30 years. Q: Could you tell us what proportion of your revenue comes from EVs? Earlier, you were aiming to scale up exports as well, but globally things have become uncertain. For FY26, what kind of revenue contribution can you expect from EVs and exports? A: Yes, you're right. The EV sector has not picked up as yet. The EV share of the whole two-wheeler market is less than 5% and it has not even crossed that mark. Our share is also around 4.7% or so. We are moving in line with the share of the EV sector. We are OEM to 80% of the organised EV market, so we'll grow as per the growth of the industry. On the export side, we have done a lot of groundwork. We wish to grow further ahead, but the geopolitical situation has not been good and tariff uncertainties also came in. But we have held the ground. This year, we can see an appreciable improvement in exports, as one of the customers has a new order of \u20b975 crore in the pipeline, which we hope will go as per plans. Q: And what would that take your overall export contribution to this year? A: Right now, we are at around 4.5%, and next year we will definitely, hopefully, improve it. Q: Because exports offer better margins for you? A: Yes. We are at \u20b9147 crore. Our aim is to go to \u20b9250 crore. Q: And what does that do to your margins?"

A net 42% of fund managers surveyed by Bank of America (BofA) preferred India over other regional markets, placing it ahead of Japan (39%), China (6%), and Singapore (3%). \u201cIndia emerges as the most favored market, perceived as a likely beneficiary of supply chain realignments following the effects of tariffs,\u201d BofA Securities stated in its latest fund managers survey. Interestingly, China climbed to the third spot from being the least favoured market in the previous month. Meanwhile, Thailand and Taiwan continue to rank as the least preferred markets among fund managers. Japan, the second-largest Asian market after China, has lagged India in performance so far this year. While the benchmark Nifty50 has risen 4% since the beginning of the year, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 has declined by 4.4% over the same period. The survey further reveals that infrastructure and consumption remain the dominant investment themes in India that fund managers are closely tracking. Additionally, sentiment toward China has improved notably, with the country climbing to the third spot from its position at the bottom just a month ago, according to the survey conducted earlier this month. In the Asia ex-Japan portfolio, fund managers remain overweight on telecom and software sectors, while underweighting energy, materials, and consumer discretionary e-commerce. Notably, sentiment toward semiconductors has improved since April. According to BofA, the share of participants expecting a downturn in the semiconductor cycle has declined to a net 42%, down from 59% last month. According to the survey, a turnaround in the economic growth outlook has boosted market return expectations across the Asia-Pacific region. While a net 58% of fund managers still expect an earnings slowdown, this marks a notable improvement from 78% in the previous month. Additionally, consensus earnings estimates are not seen as overly stretched compared to last month, suggesting there is room for upward revisions going forward. A total of 208 panelists, collectively managing $522 billion in assets, participated in the survey, according to BofA Securities. Of these, 174 panelists with $458 billion in assets under management (AUM) responded to the global Fund Manager Survey (FMS) questions, while 109 panelists overseeing $234 billion in AUM took part in the regional FMS section conducted between May 2 and May 8, 2025."

SRF stock is down for the second day in a row, while Navin Fluorine shares are down for third day running. Chemplast Sanmar Managing Director Ramkumar Shankar said the company has announced a greenfield capex of \u20b9340 crore for the production of R32 refrigerant gas. \"This project, along with the ongoing MPB expansion under the CMC business, reinforces its strategy to grow in the specialty chemicals space,\" he said in an investor presentation. \"R-32 has zero ODP (Ozone Depletion Potential). R-32 (Class 2L) has a low burning velocity, minimizing flame spread and reducing fire hazards,\" the company said. This development led to drop in share prices of SRF Ltd and Navin Fluorine on May 14. Both companies are major producers of R32, a refrigerant widely used in air conditioning and refrigeration systems. This development led to decline in share prices of SRF and Navin Fluorine. Both these companies are major producers of R32, which is used in air conditioning and low-temperature refrigeration systems. It absorbs heat and creates cool air. While announcing its March quarter results, SRF pegged its capex guidance for FY26 at \u20b92,200-2,300 crore, up sharply from \u20b91,200 crore in FY25, but this primarily relates to projects already announced. SRF's management guided to \"flat-to-slightly positive\" pricing moves in R32 and other HFC refrigerants (R134a, R125) from current levels. R32 export prices are seen eventually catching up with import prices. Management further said that it does not expect a major downturn in HFC prices, even after new capacities by competitors such as Gujarat Fluorochemicals are commissioned. For the refrigerant R32, brokerage firm Kotak institutional Equities now assume a more gradual 5% inflation in price each year versus its previous assumption of 15% per annum; this is consistent with management\u2019s near-term outlook. Navin Fluorine has successfully commercialised additional R32 capacity in March 2025, which is now running at optimal levels. Management highlighted sustained demand and favorable pricing trends for both HFOs and R32s. For FY26, NFIL has planned a capex outlay of \u20b9500\u2013600 crore. The company aims to sustain EBITDA margins above current levels, expected to range between 23\u201327%, by focusing on operational efficiency, enhancing product mix, and controlling fixed costs.

The lawsuit accuses the singer of making remarks that \"emotionally provoked\" and \"hurt the sentiments\" of the community and incited hatred among Karnataka's linguistic communities.

The precautionary measure comes amid heightened concern over the possible spread of the virus among animals and staff. The Gorakhpur zoo has been closed for a week after laboratory results from the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) in Bhopal confirmed that the tigress, named Shakti, died from bird flu. Zoo Director Vikas Yadav enforced the closure under instructions from the Chief Conservator of Forests, with operations expected to remain suspended until 21 May. So far, four animals have died at the Gorakhpur facility in recent weeks \u2014 including two tigers, a leopard, and a female wolf. The latest casualty was Mona, a female leopard recently transferred from Kanpur, who died on Thursday. Shakti passed away on 7 May, while Bhairavi, a female wolf, died two days later. Another tiger, named Kesari, died under similar circumstances on 30 March.

Samples from the animals were sent to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) in Bareilly and to NIHSAD in Bhopal. While Shakti's infection with H5N1 was confirmed, Bhairavi\u2019s test results are still awaited. The illness of another tiger, Pataudi, who was recently shifted to Kanpur Zoo for medical attention, has raised further concerns about potential transmission. In response, authorities have also closed the Etawah Lion Safari and its associated Asiatic Lion Breeding Centre from 14 to 20 May as a precaution. Although there have been no confirmed cases of bird flu at the safari, officials are taking no chances. Etawah Safari Director Anil Kumar Patel stated that the decision was made out of caution, especially in light of Pataudi\u2019s illness, as he had originally been a resident of the Etawah facility.

All staff must wear gloves, face masks, PPE kits, and regularly sanitise their hands.

This situation places India in a strategically awkward position as it balances both geopolitical and trade priorities. Palit notes that while India is actively pursuing multiple free trade agreements\u2014having concluded one with the UK and working towards a significant deal with the European Union\u2014the United States is closely watching these developments. These are issues where it is not easy for India to immediately agree, and particularly when you have the threat of a conflict management role being offered to you as some form of a carrot. It doesn't work that way, Palit added. Read Here | Tariff rollback buoys US outlook, S&P Global rules out recession Recently, US tariffs on Chinese goods were cut from 145% to 30%, and China responded by reducing its duties on American imports from 125% to 10%. Palit suggests that the core driver behind this agreement was not trade. \u201cIf you look at the US and China deal, or the issue on which the agreement was done, 80% of it was a discussion on fentanyl. It has nothing to do with any other consideration, any other trade fact, any other trade issues,\u201d he said. He described US trade policy as increasingly ad hoc and disconnected from conventional trade priorities, noting that decisions often stem from broader political objectives. This unpredictable approach, he argued, is becoming more evident to global players. \u201cThere are countries who will have a bigger capacity to resist this ad hocism on part of the US. There are countries which will not. For example, a country like Vietnam, given its dependence on the US market and its strategic position between the US and China, will not have that room for long,\u201d Palit said.

            "text": "HomeIndia NewsEnvironment NewsIn this Indian city, cool roofs and misting bus stops help people survive 42\u00b0C heat For 20-year-old Mayank Yadav, riding a crowded bus in the summer months in this western Indian city can be like sitting in an oven. That makes it a treat when he steps off and into a bus stop outfitted with sprinklers that bathe overheated commuters in a cooling mist. \u201cEveryone is suffering from the heat,\u201d Yadav said. \u201cI hope they do more of this across the city.\u201d Rising heat is a problem for millions of people in India. In Ahmedabad, temperatures this year have already reached 42 degrees Celsius (107 Fahrenheit), a level usually not seen for several more weeks, prompting city officials to advise people to stay indoors and stay hydrated. And yet, coping with that heat is a familiar challenge in Ahmedabad. After a 2010 heat wave killed more than 1,300 people, city and health officials rushed to develop South Asia\u2019s first heat action plan. The plan, rolled out in 2013 and now replicated across India and South Asia, includes strategies for hospitals, government officials and citizens to react immediately when temperatures rise beyond human tolerance. Public health officials said it\u2019s helped save hundreds of lives every summer. Read more: Half of 2020-born could face unprecedented exposure to climate extremes: Study City officials, with help from climate and health researchers, have implemented two simple yet effective solutions to help those affected most by heat: the poor and those who work outdoors. By painting tin-roofed households with reflective paint, they\u2019ve reduced indoor temperatures, which otherwise might be up to 5 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than outside. More recently, the city hung curtains woven of straw and water sprinklers at one bus stop so commuters can get relief from the sun and heat. Officials said they plan to expand the idea to other bus stops in the city. Residents said both measures have been a relief even as they brace for at least three more months of sweltering summer. A simple coat of paint makes all the difference Throughout the city\u2019s low-income neighborhoods, hundreds of tin-roofed homes have been painted with reflective paint that helps keep the indoors cooler. Residents said their houses were so hot before the roofs were painted that they would spend most of their time outdoors under any shade they could find. \u201cEarlier, it was really difficult to sleep inside the house,\u201d said Akashbhai Thakor, who works as a delivery van driver and lives with his wife and three-month-old child in Ahmedabad. Thakor\u2019s roof was painted as part of a research project that is trying to measure the impact of the so-called cool roofs. Read more: World records second warmest April; global temperature remains above pre-industrial levels Early results have been promising. \u201cAfter the roof was painted, the house is much cooler, especially at night,\u201d said Thakor. People like Thakor are much more vulnerable to extreme heat because their houses aren\u2019t insulated and, since most of them depend on a daily wage, they must work regardless of the weather, said Priya Bhavsar of the Indian Institute of Public Health Gandhinagar, who is working on the project. Bhavsar said low-cost solutions could be the only respite for thousands of people in the city who can\u2019t afford to buy an air conditioner. Veer Vanzara, who lives in the same area as Thakor and works in a nearby garment factory, said the heat makes his job much worse, especially since his factory has no ventilation. So his family is grateful for the cool roofs. \u201cThe evenings and night are much cooler than before inside our house,\u201d he said. A bus stop that\u2019s become an oasis from the heat. In Ahmedabad\u2019s city center, a 25-meter stretch of a bus stop has been draped with mats made of straw which, when sprinkled with water, immediately cool the hot wind. Sprinklers installed on the bus stop roof lightly spray cool water on the commuters below, providing instant relief from the blazing heat just a step away. \u201cWhen nothing like this was here, it was really hot. What they\u2019ve done is really good. Senior citizens like me can get some cooling from the heat,\u201d said 77-year-old Ratilal Bhoire, who was waiting under the sprinklers with his daughter. Bhoire said when he was younger, Ahmedabad was hot, but it was still possible to walk many kilometers without feeling dizzy, even at the height of summer. \u201cNowadays you can\u2019t do that,\u201d he said.

Shah and other city officials said the onset of summer has become a testing time and efforts such as cool roofs and cool bus stops are reducing heat-related illness and deaths. As climate projections predict only hotter and longer summers for his city, Shah said being prepared is the only thing to do. \u201cIt (the heat) needs to be addressed in the proper way,\u201d he said."

Concerned about the potential repercussions on the current tourism season, the state government commenced consultations with key industry stakeholders. Tourism Minister Rohan Khaunte held discussions on Tuesday (May 13) with representatives from various segments of the tourism ecosystem \u2014 including the Tourism Trade Association of Goa, water sports operators, shack owners, and hoteliers.

The minister confirmed a spike in hotel booking cancellations, both from within India and abroad, due to safety concerns, following the Pahalgam terror attack that claimed the lives of 26 people. At the meetings, participants were urged to assess potential long-term challenges stemming in the aftermath of the situation in Pahalgam. The tourism department has called upon four- and five-star hotels to explore new strategies and business models. \u201cSometimes, adversity allows us to work towards better opportunities. Five-star and four-star hotels are now talking about MICE, monsoon tourism, and re-evaluating their rates. They have to see the overall scenario of tourism,\u201d he said. Khaunte acknowledged that Goa is increasingly perceived as an expensive destination, citing elevated airfares and accommodation costs as deterrents. \u201cAfter Budgetary announcements, people from the middle-income and higher middle-income categories are likely to become contributors to tourism,\u201d he explained.

The minister expressed optimism that the current downturn is temporary and that normalcy would return once geopolitical tensions subside. He added that the state is intensifying efforts to draw travellers from the UAE and other international markets to promote monsoon tourism. Khaunte highlighted that chartered and scheduled flights are already bringing in visitors from countries such as Poland, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. \u201cThe number of Russian tourists is expected to double in the upcoming year, compared to 2024,\u201d he concluded"

Gaurav Malhotra, Executive Director at Axis Capital, noted that Starlink\u2019s average revenue per user (ARPU) globally ranges between $25 to $30, compared to $4\u2013$5 for mobile operators in India even after recent tariff hikes.

With rising property prices and stagnant incomes, many young Indians feel priced out of the housing market. But there\u2019s a smarter, more achievable way in\u2014property laddering. This approach encourages homebuyers to start small and upgrade over time. Instead of waiting years to afford the perfect home, you buy what you can today, build equity, and gradually move up. \u201cProperty laddering is a smart, goal-oriented approach where buyers start with a smaller, more affordable home and gradually upgrade to more premium properties over time as their financial capacity grows,\u201d says Mukesh Choudhary, Founder of AccuSpace. \u201cInstead of waiting years to afford your dream home, you begin with what\u2019s financially viable today. Laddering empowers young professionals and first-time buyers to enter the market early, build equity, and reinvest profits into larger or better-located properties. It\u2019s not just about owning property\u2014it\u2019s about creating a stepping stone to long-term financial and lifestyle goals,\u201d he adds. The idea is simple: buy a modest home in a fast-growing location, live in it or rent it out, and then sell it after a few years when its value appreciates. The gains from this sale are then used to fund a larger, better property. How it works? Let\u2019s say you currently live in a smaller home and plan to buy a bigger house worth \u20b91.25 crore. You make a down payment of \u20b931 lakh and take a loan of \u20b994 lakh. After repaying \u20b919 lakh of the loan over a few years, you sell your original property for \u20b980 lakh. \u201cDoing so can significantly reduce your debt burden and allow you to repay your loan much faster,\u201d says Atul Monga, CEO and Co-Founder of BASIC Home Loan. \u201cYou use the \u20b980 lakh to prepay a large portion of your existing loan, leaving you with a manageable balance\u2014and a larger home. This step-by-step approach helps you move closer to your dream home without taking on heavy financial stress all at once.\u201d Who should consider it? Property laddering is especially helpful for: First-time homebuyers: You don\u2019t have to wait for a perfect home. Start now with what you can afford. Young professionals: Enter the market early and let property appreciation work in your favour. Middle-income families: Upgrade without taking on massive financial stress. But it's not risk-free While laddering can be rewarding, it comes with risks: Market volatility: Property prices may not appreciate as expected. Transaction costs: Stamp duty, registration fees, agent commissions, and home loan processing charges can eat into profits. Liquidity issues: Selling a property isn\u2019t always quick, especially during downturns. Tax impact: You may have to pay capital gains tax on profits from selling the first property. Loan eligibility stress: Taking multiple loans over time could affect your credit score or EMI capacity. So while it\u2019s a practical strategy, it demands careful planning, sound location choices, and a long-term view."

            "text": "HomeMarket NewsHere's why the Raymond stock ticker shows a fall of 66% today Shares of textile and real estate player Raymond Ltd. tumbled as much as 66% on Wednesday, May 14, as the stock turned ex-date for the demerger of its real estate business \u2014 Raymond Realty Ltd. Raymond Ltd.'s stock crashed 66.05%, hitting a low of \u20b9530, compared to its previous close of \u20b91,561.30. This sharp fall occurred because the real estate business is no longer factored into Raymond's fundamentals. Some mobile trading apps may still be showing the unadjusted price of Raymond Ltd., which could explain the perceived 66% drop. Under the approved scheme, shareholders of Raymond Ltd. will receive one equity share of Raymond Realty for every share held in Raymond Ltd. Importantly, those holding shares in Raymond Ltd. have not seen a loss in the overall value of their holdings, as the share price has been adjusted post-demerger. Going forward, these investors will hold equity in both Raymond Ltd. and Raymond Realty, which will operate as an independent entity. Raymond Realty is expected to be listed in the September quarter of FY26. The demerger is part of Raymond Group\u2019s broader strategic overhaul, aimed at unlocking value by creating focused verticals. In the last quarter of FY25, Raymond Realty posted a booking value of \u20b9636 crore, driven by projects such as The Address by GS 2.0, Invictus, Park Avenue \u2013 High Street Retail in Thane, and the JDA project The Address by GS in Bandra. The business reported a revenue of \u20b9766 crore, marking a 13% increase year-on-year. EBITDA stood at \u20b9194 crore, with a margin of 25.3%. Previously, Raymond also demerged its lifestyle business - Raymond Lifestyle, which was listed on stock exchanges in September 2024."

If you look at what we did last year, we were a little about 20% and then we ended this year at 25%.\u201d He said achieving 20% compound annual growth in revenue and 25% in EBITDA is possible, but growth in the CDMO sector tends to be uneven. Some years may see slower momentum, while others could deliver stronger results.

Trump \"has cut funding and support to the arts, humanities and education.

Organisers stress that they want to avoid politics and focus on the films, but this year's inclusion of movies from Gaza, Ukraine and Iran, as well as Trump's tariff announcement shortly before the festival, has put more focus on the world outside Cannes.

While growth is expected to slow down sharply, it\u2019s not expected to fall into negative territory, thanks in part to easing trade tensions with China. Paul Gruenwald, Global Chief Economist at S&P Global Ratings, said the rollback and pause in US-China tariffs is offering some support to growth. \u201cWith most tariffs now reduced or on hold, we are back to our earlier forecast from March,\u201d he noted. \u201cChina\u2019s growth is expected around 4% this year, and the US is likely to grow closer to 2% on average.\u201d He added that this temporary pause in the tariff war provides a small but helpful push for economic activity\u2014at least for the next few months. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to watch how it evolves,\u201d he said. Earlier S&P Global Ratings had revised its outlook for the US economy, cutting the GDP growth forecast for 2025 by 50 basis points to 1.5%. For 2026, the growth projection has been trimmed by 20 basis points, bringing it down to 1.7%. While S&P does not predict a recession in its base case, it does expect a sharp slowdown in the US economy. The US has been growing at nearly 3% over the past couple of years. Gruenwald explained that as we move through 2025, growth could slow to between 0% and 1%. That\u2019s a big drop, but not quite a technical recession. Read Here | China more attractive than India on valuations: Lyn Alden When asked if further talks and reductions in tariffs could lead to benefits like lower US taxes, Gruenwald was cautious. \u201cWe were never convinced that tariff revenues would allow for big tax cuts. In reality, tariffs are just extra costs, mostly paid by US consumers,\u201d he said. He welcomed the rollback of tariffs and hoped for further reductions. Lower tariffs help boost growth, support central banks, and keep inflation in check, he added. However, he also warned that US trade policy remains unpredictable. He said, \u201cTrump style is very unorthodox, as we have seen so far, and we have had very volatile trade policy from the US, and we will just have to see how that develops in the coming quarters.\u201d Also Read | Goldman Sachs cuts US recession risk, sees India growth holding firm Follow our live blog for more stock market updates global market outlookMarket analystsUS recessionUS-China tariffs"

The stock has gained in three out of the last five trading sessions, while shares of Suzlon are up for the third day running. Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal has reiterated its 'Buy' rating on Suzlon Energy, with a price target of \u20b975 per share. This implies an upside potential of 30% from the stock's last closing level on Tuesday. Motilal sees two key implications from the recent draft RLMM notification: 1) Should the draft receive regulatory approval, it sees competitive intensity moderating in the medium term. 2) There is scope for further market share expansion for Suzlon given Indian OEMs account for barely 50-60% of new orders and the company's integrated domestic manufacturing capabilities across all key components. According to Motilal, Suzlon is focused on raising its share of EPC contracts in the overall order book (20% now to 50% in the medium term), which will be key in providing greater visibility and control in terms of deliveries. Suzlon Energy is currently valued at 24 times its estimated earnings for FY27, and the brokerage believes Suzlon's valuations are attractive following the recent correction. Shares of Suzlon Energy are currently trading 2.13% higher on Wednesday at \u20b958.85. The stock is up 8% over the last one month, but are down 10% so far in 2025."

For FY26, the company has guided for 8% EBITDA margins, translating to about \u20b9400 crore in absolute terms. The company's strategy includes reducing reliance on its lower-margin consumer segment, which contributed around 35% to revenue in FY25. \"We did almost four million pieces of smart metering electronics last year,\u201d Gujral noted, adding that the segment will continue to see growth despite some delays and resistance in implementation. In healthcare, Syrma is seeing traction in segments like neonatal care, respiratory and heart monitoring devices, and cosmetic lasers. Gujral said these products not only contribute to current revenue but also build long-term growth visibility, since design-led engagements often translate into commercial production two to three years later. While exports fell just short of the \u20b91,000 crore target in FY25, the company expects to cross that mark in FY26. Export growth will be led by healthcare and industrial electronics. \"Automotive exports are almost minimal, so the growth will come from customers we onboarded in the second half of last year,\" Gujral explained. The company has also taken an enabling resolution for a qualified institutional placement (QIP) of up to \u20b91,000 crore, which may be used to fund inorganic acquisitions or capital expenditure under the government\u2019s component manufacturing policy. \"We are evaluating verticals where we are not present...

The company has grappled with a series of challenges over the past year: a surge in medical costs, a cyber attack at its tech unit, the killing of its insurance unit head and subsequent public backlash against the industry. UnitedHealth shares fell after medical services costs at the healthcare conglomerate surpassed Wall Street expectations for the first time in two years, even as it beat fourth-quarter profit and revenue estimates. February 21, 2024 UnitedHealth Group\u2019s tech unit, Change Healthcare, is hit by a cybersecurity attack on its systems. February 28, 2024 In a message posted to, and then quickly deleted from their darknet site, the hackers blamed for the strike say they stole millions of sensitive records, including medical insurance and health data, from the company. February 29, 2024 UnitedHealth Group says the cyber attack was perpetrated by hackers who identified themselves as the \u201cBlackcat\u201d ransomware group. March 13, 2024 The U.S. government says it has opened an investigation into the cyber attack to find out whether there was a breach of protected health data and if the company followed U.S. health privacy law. March 13, 2024 UnitedHealth Group says its unit Change Healthcare\u2019s pharmacy network is back online, weeks after the fallout from the cyber attack swept across the country\u2019s healthcare system that depends heavily on insurance. April 16, 2024 UnitedHealth Group says it expects the hack of its Change Healthcare unit to cost the company up to $1.6 billion in 2024, but maintained its annual earnings forecast, suggesting the cyber attack\u2019s impact was less severe than many on Wall Street had feared. May 1, 2024 Hackers who breached UnitedHealth\u2019s tech unit in February potentially stole a third of Americans\u2019 data, the largest U.S. health insurer\u2019s CEO tells a Congressional committee. July 16, 2024 UnitedHealth forecasts a bigger hit to annual earnings from the February hack at its tech unit, but maintains its full-year profit forecast. September 20, 2024 The U.S. Federal Trade Commission sues the country\u2019s three largest pharmacy benefit managers, accusing them of steering diabetes patients towards higher-priced insulin to reap millions of dollars in rebates from pharmaceutical companies. October 15, 2024 UnitedHealth Group provides a 2025 profit forecast below Wall Street estimates as it expects pressure across its government-supported health insurance businesses. November 12, 2024 The U.S. Department of Justice and three U.S. states file a lawsuit to block UnitedHealth Group\u2019s $3.3 billion acquisition of Amedisys, citing concerns that the deal would reduce competition in the home health services market. December 4, 2024 Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealth\u2019s insurance unit, is killed outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel ahead of the company\u2019s investor day in what police described as a targeted attack by a gunman lying in wait for him. December 19, 2024 The suspect in the killing of Thompson is charged with federal murder and stalking crimes in a Manhattan courtroom, alongside state murder and terrorism charges previously announced by New York prosecutors. December 23, 2024 Luigi Mangione, the man accused of fatally gunning down Thompson on a Manhattan street, pleads not guilty to New York state murder charges that brand him a terrorist. January 16, 2025 At the company\u2019s first earnings call since the murder of Thompson, CEO Andrew Witty says healthcare in the U.S. needs to be \u201cless confusing, less complex and less costly.\u201d Witty says the company will work with policymakers to reduce the frequency of prior authorization approvals required before a patient can access medical treatment in its Medicare business for people aged 65 and older or with disabilities. January 23, 2025 UnitedHealth Group names Tim No\u00ebl, the head of its Medicare business, to the top job at its health insurance business, a month after the unit\u2019s former CEO Brian Thompson was killed. January 24, 2025 The company says the cyber attack at its tech unit last year affected the personal information of 190 million people, making it the largest healthcare data breach in the United States. February 19, 2025 UnitedHealth\u2019s insurance unit offers employees in its benefits operations unit the option to accept buyouts if they quit by March 3, CNBC reports. February 21, 2025 The U.S. Justice Department is investigating UnitedHealth\u2019s Medicare billing practices, the Wall Street Journal reports. The health insurer says it is unaware of any new probe underway. February 25, 2025 U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley requests detailed information on UnitedHealth\u2019s Medicare billing practices in a letter to CEO Andrew Witty. April 4, 2025 The U.S. Federal Trade Commission\u2019s lawsuit against pharmacy benefit managers over insulin pricing practices will likely move forward again after being paused amid President Donald Trump\u2019s firing of the agency\u2019s two Democratic commissioners. April 17, 2025 UnitedHealth Group surprises investors with what its CEO said was an \u201cunusual and unacceptable\u201d quarterly earnings miss, and lowers its outlook for the full year due to higher-than-expected medical costs, sparking a more than 20% selloff in shares that reverberated across the sector. April 21, 2025 UnitedHealth Group says it spent nearly $1.7 million on security for its top executives in 2024, months after the fatal shooting of senior executive Brian Thompson. May 7, 2025 The company is sued for allegedly concealing how backlash from the killing of Thompson was damaging its business. May 13, 2025 UnitedHealth Group suspends its 2025 forecast due to surging medical costs, and CEO Andrew Witty steps down suddenly.

            "text": "HomeBusiness NewsFinance NewsHow FEMA is reshaping business mindsets in India Inc beyond compliance The evolution of India\u2019s foreign exchange policies have been a mirror of the country\u2019s development and its relationship with the complex yet integral, global economic landscape. Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA) marked a significant shift from earlier Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 (FERA). Unlike FERA, which was primarily control-oriented, FEMA is focused on facilitating management of foreign exchange with an underlying philosophy that businesses/ individuals would be largely self-compliant with regulators acting as facilitators and post-facto evaluators, enabling responsible growth while maintaining accountability and public trust. The government nonetheless followed a \u201ctrust but verify\u201d stance, passing on the baton of ensuring compliance to Authorised Dealer Bankers (ADBs). Over time, owing to global push to curb tax avoidance, varied interpretations of FEMA, digitisation and availability of data with advanced analytics, regulators are increasingly adopting eagle eyed approach, aiming that principles of FEMA are followed in spirit and substance. Some of the key areas that are seeing increasing scrutiny by Regulators include: The intensified scrutiny resounds with the government's commitment to ensure the integrity and robustness of India's financial system and indicate that mere superficial compliance may not be enough. This signals a need for business houses to shift in their approach towards FEMA compliance \u2014 from a legal necessity to a strategic business imperative. To navigate this landscape effectively, one must focus on transparency, robust documentation, and compliance right from the planning stage of any overseas transaction. It is important for businesses/ individuals to emphasise on substance i.e. cross border structures and transactions are driven by a genuine commercial rationale and not just serve as means to an end. It's essential to avoid unnecessary layering or creation of entities that lack operational substance. Businesses/individuals should also focus on strengthening their governance with robust internal compliance protocols that can withstand regulatory examination. This may include board oversight, internal audits, review of existing structures, experts\u2019 opinion for technical matters and transparent documentation. Lastly, businesses should look at promoting awareness within organisation, i.e. all the key functions like finance, tax, legal, and operations are aligned and informed about the enhanced regulatory expectations. This not only promotes a culture of compliance but also equips relevant stakeholders with the knowledge they need to make informed business decisions. By doing so, organisations/individuals can safeguard themselves from potential risks and position themselves for success in this dynamic regulated environment. In cases, where risks cannot be mitigated, businesses/ individuals can approach RBI for compounding, to clean the slate and start afresh. With the heightened regulatory scrutiny, compliance can no longer be treated as an afterthought. Proactive investment in compliance programmes, internal diligence procedures including revisiting past structures to ensure continued compliance is a must. By staying informed, accountable and responsive, one can not only mitigate regulatory risks but also build trust with stakeholders and position themselves for sustainable growth. \u2014The authors; Aditya Bajoria and Tanya Gupta, are Tax Partner and Director-Tax respectively at EY India.

I look forward to working with Prime Minister Mark Carney and our team to build a safer, fairer world and deliver for Canadians. pic.twitter.com/NpPqyah9k3 Who Is Anita Anand? Anand, who was the transport minister and had earlier held the defence portfolio, said in January that she was leaving politics and returning to academia. However, Carney persuaded her to return to the cabinet and take the foreign affairs portfolio after she was re-elected in last month\u2019s election. She has also been a Member of Parliament for Oakville, Ontario. In Carney\u2019s cabinet, one of Anand\u2019s missions will be to pilot the reset of the almost ruptured ties with India that Carney signalled, while managing the delicate relations with President Donald Trump\u2019s America. According to some reports, Anand served at the Ministry of Public Services and Procurement during the Covid-19 pandemic, where she directed Canada\u2019s vaccine acquisitions and health-related commodities. In 2021, she became the Defence Minister and during her tenure, she oversaw Canada\u2019s assistance to Ukraine in the war against Russia and addressed sexual misconduct amongst the Canadian Armed Forces. Her parents had been doctors in India, who migrated to Canada in the early 1960s, reports claim. Anand received first-class degrees from Dalhousie University, the University of Toronto, and Oxford University."

            "text": "HomeMarket NewsChart Of The Day: Naukri-parent has the potential to jump another 20% in the next few weeks On Wednesday, May 13, we bring to you Info Edge India, the parent company of platforms like Naukri and 99Acres, from Sacchitanand Uttekar of Tradebulls Securities. Here is his analysis of the stock: Importantly, the stock has closed above its 200-DEMA for the first time in nearly 8 weeks, reinforcing the breakout strength. This move is supported by strong volumes, both in the cash and derivative segments, lending credibility to the price action. The pattern target is projected around \u20b91,750, while immediate momentum could push the stock towards \u20b91,570. From a risk-reward standpoint, the setup remains attractive. A daily close below \u20b91,395 would invalidate the bullish structure, making it an ideal stop-loss zone for fresh entries. We believe this is a good opportunity to consider adding the stock to one's portfolio up to \u20b91,440, with the expectation of a resumption in its secular uptrend, aiming for targets of \u20b91,570 followed by \u20b91,750 in the coming weeks. Levels of \u20b91,750 imply a potential upside of 20% from current levels. Shares of Info Edge ended 0.8% lower on Tuesday at \u20b91,464.5. Despite a 9% gain over the last one month, the stock is down 16% so far in 2025."

            "text": "HomeMarket NewsTata Motors shares fall after analyst downgrades, cut to estimates on cautious JLR outlook Shares of Tata Motors Ltd. will be reacting to their March quarter results, that were reported after market hours on Tuesday, May 13. Brokerage firm CLSA has an \"outperform\" rating on Tata Motors with a price target of \u20b9805, which implies a potential upside of 14% on the stock from Wednesday's closing levels. It said that JLR is cautious on demand in financial year 2026 due to tariffs and different macro-economic conditions. However, it added that the luxury Passenger Vehicle market will not have much impact due to these tariff-related uncertainties. Despite the uncertainties, JLR is confident of delivering on its EBIT margin in financial year 2026. On the flip side, Jefferies has an \"underperform\" rating on Tata Motors with a price target of \u20b9630, which implies a potential downside of 11% from Wednesday's closing levels. The brokerage anticipates a tough year ahead for JLR, due to the US tariffs, increasing competition in China, and rising customer acquisition costs. Adding to that is a slowdown in the Indian Commercial Vehicle market, and rising competition in the electric PV space, Jefferies said. As a result, Jefferies has cut Tata Motors' Earnings Before Interest, Tax Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) estimates for financial year 2026 and 2027 by 8% and 9%, but has increased its Earnings Per Share (EPS) estimates by 3% to 4%. Citi, who has suspended its rating on Tata Motors, believes that while the management appears positive for its India CV business, there could be some near-term headwinds for the Passenger Vehicles business, particularly within the EV segment. Kotak Institutional Equities has downgraded the stock to \"sell\" from its earlier rating of \"reduce\", with a price target of \u20b9600 per share, implying a potential downside of 15% from current levels. Similar to Jefferies, Kotak sees the near-term to remain challenging for JLR, despite turning net cash in financial year 2025. The challenges could come from weak demand trends in China and the impact of tariffs on the US markets. Loss in market share for Tata Motors in its India CV and PV business also remains an area of concern, according to the brokerage. The brokerage has cut Tata Motors' consolidated EBITDA estimates by 4% and 10% over financial year 2025-2027. Out of the 34 analysts that have coverage on Tata Motors, 19 of them have a \"buy\" rating on the stock, nine say \"hold\", while six have a \"sell\" rating on the stock. Shares of Tata Motors fell as much as 3% on Wednesday before recovering some of the morning losses to trade at \u20b9697.7."

            "text": "HomeWorld NewsPeru Prime Minister resigns after backlash from cabinet reshuffle Peru\u2019s prime minister resigned on Tuesday evening after a last-ditch attempt at a cabinet reshuffle did not placate opposition lawmakers who demanded his ouster. Gustavo Adrianzen announced his resignation in a nationwide address just hours after unpopular President Dina Boluarte had sworn in new ministers, including a new finance chief. All other ministers must resign alongside Adrianzen, including those named earlier on Tuesday, although Boluarte may rename them to their posts as long as she appoints a new prime minister. The cabinet collapse was all but inevitable. The opposition-led Congress had previously scheduled a vote of no confidence against Adrianzen for Wednesday, and the cabinet reshuffle further emboldened congressional groups to insist on ousting him. Boluarte\u2019s popularity rating reached a record low of 2% in an Ipsos poll published this week. Though new Finance Minister Raul Perez-Reyes will have to resign, Boluarte may choose to reappoint the loyal official who has already served as transport minister and production minister during her presidency. He is already Boluarte\u2019s fourth finance chief in her two-year presidency. However, she may weigh the support that Perez-Reyes\u2019 predecessor mustered in the minutes before his removal. As rumors traveled of the potential removal of now-former Finance Minister Jose Salardi, the heads of Peru\u2019s top business groups released a statement in support of his policies. Replacing Salardi months into the role \u201cwill create uncertainty in the economy with a change so quick and premature,\u201d said Jose Zapata, the head of business trade group Confiep in an interview with the RPP radio network just before the new appointment. \u201cAnd we also think he was a minister who has been doing things well.\u201d"

But while Newsom is calling the expected drop in revenue a \u201cTrump Slump,\u201d an upswing in the stock market could once again buoy the state\u2019s coffers. The same day the memo was released, a rally powered by the world\u2019s largest technology companies put US stocks higher for the year. The US and China announced on Monday that it will temporarily lower tariffs on each other\u2019s products. The memo, first reported by Politico, comes a day before the governor is slated to release his updated budget proposal for the fiscal year beginning in July. The revenue adjustments signal that the state will face its third consecutive fiscal year in which lawmakers need to plug significant holes. California is required by its constitution to balance its budgets. California\u2019s budget is highly sensitive to economic swings because it relies heavily on the state\u2019s wealthiest residents, whose income, especially from capital gains, is closely tied to the stock market.

The management, in its earnings call on Tuesday, May 13, said that its Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) margins in financial year 2026 will range between 23.5% and 24.5%, which is lower than the 25.9% level it achieved in financial year 2025. Analysts who track Cipla believe that margins will see a further 300 basis points contraction in financial year 2027 as its key drug gRevlimid fully phases out. With the US business currently heavily reliant on the gRevlimid, new launches, including gAbraxane, gTasigna and gAdvair, are unlikely to offset this pressure on margins due to the phasing out of gRevlimid in the current financial year, according to the analysts. For the new financial year, Cipla expects its topline to see \"continued growth trajectory\" and the management fell short of providing a number. Analysts are interpreting this as growth remaining flat to low-single-digits in the new financial year. The management also highlighted during the earnings call that revenue for the US business is likely to remain flat for the June quarter. For the March quarter, Cipla's US business was marginally better than expectations at $221 million, compared to estimates of $218 million, although the figure was lower than the $226 million it reported during the same quarter last year. Cipla's March quarter profit was aided by lower tax outgo and higher other income, while margins, despite a 140 basis points expansion, were below expectations of 24%. Shares of Cipla had a volatile reaction post the earnings announcement, eventually ending 0.6% higher on Tuesday at \u20b91,520. The stock has remained flat so far in 2025."

Rohit Sharma had become a mainstay at the top of the order for Team India in the longest format since 2019. Replacing him as a skipper will be a tall ask, but finding a substitute to his reliable batting credentials could be an even tougher task. Here are five players the team can consider roping into the playing XI to strengthen their line-up from the coming series of England onwards. (Image Source: Reuters) No. 1 | Abhimanyu Easwaran | The Bengal batter has been Mr. Consistent in first-class cricket, playing 101 games at an average of 48.87, aggregating 7674 runs. He has notched 27 centuries and was also a part of the Men in Blue in their tour Down Under. Given that he has been in the proximity of the senior squad for considerable time now, it is only fitting that the 30-year-old debuts in red ball cricket in the forseeable future. (Image Source: Reuters) No. 3 | Devdutt Padikkal | The southpaw played a game during the recent Border-Gavaskar Trophy and is in the scheme of things as far as the red ball circuit is concerned. The 24-year-old has played 43 first-class games and notched 2815 runs at an average of 41.39 with six centuries. With him in the side, the team will have two left-handers opening the batting, as Yashasvi Jaiswal is already a fixed asset on that front. (Image Source: Reuters) No. 5 | Ravikumar Samarth | The 32-year-old from Mysore, Karataka, has been a veteran, playing 95 red-ball domestic games and bringing up 6157 runs through 35 half-centuries and 15 tons. He, alongside Padikkal, have produced promising returns for the state off late. His average has falled slightly below 40, but the dependability that he brings upfront can add some much-needed steel to the Indian batting unit. (Image Source: X) Rohit endured a difficult tour of Australia, mustering merely 31 runs across six innings. However, his record prior to that has been solid and India needs to arguably look deep inside its rich domestic cricket to unearth more gems like the 38-year-old. (Image Source: Reuters)"

            "text": "HomeIndia News\u2018Boycott Turkey\u2019 trends online as anger grows in India over Ankara\u2019s stance on Pakistan A growing online campaign calling to \u201cBoycott Turkey\u201d is gaining momentum across Indian social media platforms. Users are urging fellow citizens to avoid Turkish products, services, and tourist destinations, triggering a broader economic backlash against Ankara. The online anger began after Turkey publicly criticised India\u2019s military strikes on terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). On May 7, the Turkish foreign minister issued a sharp statement, warning that India\u2019s actions could lead to a wider war\u2014a comment that sparked immediate backlash online. Turkish Drones Found in Attacks The controversy escalated further when Indian authorities confirmed that drones shot down near the border were of Turkish origin. These drones were allegedly used in attacks launched from Pakistani territory \u2014 fuelling suspicions of Turkish support to Pakistan. \u201cIndia Helped Turkey, Turkey Helped Pakistan\u201d The online protest took a more emotional turn as users circulated messages highlighting India\u2019s past assistance to Turkey. A viral post summed up the mood: \u201cIndia helped Turkey in its darkest hour, Turkey helped Pakistan in ours.\u201d Travel Industry Takes Swift Action The protest didn\u2019t stay confined to the internet. Major travel firms responded quickly. EaseMyTrip issued an advisory asking travellers to avoid non-essential trips to Turkey. Soon after, Cox & Kings and ixigo suspended all new bookings to the country, citing rising geopolitical tensions. Tourism Could Suffer a Big Blow Over 2.75 lakh Indian tourists visited Turkey in 2024, contributing nearly \u20b93,000 crore to the Turkish economy. If travel bookings decline as expected, Turkey could see a significant drop in tourism revenue from India. Trade and Investment Ties at Risk India-Turkey bilateral trade stood at $10.43 billion in 2023, with India being the larger exporter. In addition, Turkey has received over $227 million in foreign direct investment (FDI) from India. Indian businesses have also invested nearly $200 million in the Turkish market. \"Indian investment in Turkiye stood at around $200 million for the period August 2000 to March 2024,\" DPIIT officials told CNBC TV18. What Lies Ahead If the boycott sentiment on social media translates into real-world action \u2014 with fewer bookings, lower product demand, and investment freezes \u2014 the economic impact on Turkey could be hard to ignore. With both tourism and trade at stake, Ankara\u2019s ties with New Delhi may be heading into a tense phase."

            "text": "HomeMarket NewsSebi mulls relaxation in regulatory compliance for FPIs investing only in govt bonds Markets regulator Sebi on Tuesday proposed to simplify rules and ease regulatory compliance for FPIs that invest exclusively in Indian government bonds (IGBs) via the voluntary retention route (VRR) and fully accessible route (FAR). In its consultation paper, the regulator has proposed easing registration and other compliance requirements for a new FPI (foreign portfolio investors) category called IGB-FPIs -- investing exclusively in government bonds. Sebi has suggested that IGB-FPIs will not need to provide investor group details, as bond investments under FAR/VRR don't have such limits. Also Read: Ravi Infrabuild Projects files draft papers with Sebi to raise \u20b91,100 crore through IPO Generally, FPIs are required to disclose group structures for investment cap monitoring. It suggested that certain compliance requirements like investor group disclosure and investment caps will not apply to IGB-FPIs. The new category should invest only in Indian government bonds via FAR and VRR. Moreover, clubbing rules for group investments will not apply to IGB-FPIs. Currently, NRIs, OCIs, and resident Indians can't contribute more than 25 per cent individually or 50 per cent collectively to an FPI, and can't control it. The regulator suggested removing these restrictions for IGB-FPIs, allowing NRIs/OCIs/RIs to invest freely in IGB-FPIs and be in control of IGB-FPIs. Also, Sebi also proposed aligning the KYC review timelines for IGB-FPIs with those prescribed by the RBI -- 2, 8, or 10 years, depending on the risk level -- rather than the current requirement of annual or triennial reviews for FPIs. With regard to the timeline for disclosing material changes, the regulator proposed a uniform 30-day window for all material change disclosures for IGB-FPIs. At present, FPIs are required to report key changes within seven or 30 days based on the type of change. Also Read: SEBI revises REITs, InvITs disclosure norms for offer documents For the transition between regular FPIs and IGB-FPIs, Sebi proposed allowing regular FPIs to switch to IGB-FPI status if they sell all non-IGB holdings and close their trading and demat accounts. Similarly, IGB-FPIs may transition back to regular FPIs by complying with the standard FPI regulations. India's inclusion in major global bond indices -- JP Morgan, Bloomberg, and FTSE--is expected to bring more foreign investments. According to Sebi data, FPI investment in FAR-eligible bonds has already risen significantly, reaching over Rs 3 lakh crore (USD 35.7 billion) by March 2025. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has invited public comments on the proposals until June 3, 2025."

US President Donald Trump reiterated his claim that his administration had \"successfully brokered a historic ceasefire\" between India and Pakistan to stop escalating violence. \u201cJust days ago, my administration successfully brokered a historic ceasefire to stop the escalating violence between India and Pakistan,\u201d Trump said, speaking at the investment forum in the Saudi capital. He added that trade was used as a tool in the negotiations. \u201cAnd I used trade to a large extent to do it. And I said, \u2018Fellows, come on. Let's make a deal. Let's do some trading,\u201d he said, addressing an audience that included attendees such as billionaire Elon Musk. \u201cLet's not trade nuclear missiles. Let's trade the things that you make so beautifully. And they both have very powerful leaders, very strong leaders, good leaders, smart leaders. And it all stopped. Hopefully, it'll remain that way, but it all stopped,\" Trump added. He credited the success to the work of his administration. \u201cI was very proud of Secretary of State Marco Rubio and all of the people who worked so hard. Marco stand up. What a great job you did on that. Thank you. Vice President JD Vance, Marco, the whole group worked with you, but there's a great, great job, and think they're actually getting along,\u201d Trump said. On Syria President Trump also announced that he would lift sanctions on Syria at the request of Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, in what he described as a major step toward stabilising the war-torn country. \u201cI will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,\u201d Trump said at the forum in Riyadh. The United States had maintained sanctions on Syria since the rule of former President Bashar al-Assad, who was removed from power in December following over 13 years of conflict. The move is expected to significantly aid interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who is seeking to bring stability to the country. According to the White House, Trump is scheduled to meet Sharaa during his Saudi visit. Reuters quoted two Syrian presidency sources saying that Sharaa would travel to Riyadh for the meeting. On Iran President Trump also addressed the Iran nuclear issue, urging Tehran to take a \u201cnew and a better path\u201d while warning of consequences if it fails to do so. \u201cAs I have shown repeatedly, I am willing to end past conflicts and forge new partnerships for a better and more stable world, even if our differences may be profound,\u201d Trump said at the same forum. \u201cBut if Iran's leadership rejects this olive branch ... we will have no choice but to inflict massive maximum pressure, drive Iranian oil exports to zero,\u201d he added. Trump noted that he does not wish for conflict, but expressed concern about Iran\u2019s accelerating nuclear programme. \u201cI want to avoid conflict,\u201d he said, \u201cbut time is running out.\u201d His comments followed the recent fourth round of talks led by his special envoy Steve Witkoff with Iranian officials. Trump also stated he hopes Saudi Arabia will eventually join the Abraham Accords and formally recognise Israel. \u201cIn your own time,\u201d he said. With agency inputs"

As per DRI, high-end Luxury Cars were being imported by resorting to undervaluation to the extent of 50% by mis-declaring the import value at the Indian ports to evade the applicable Customs Duties. These luxury cars would first be transported to Dubai/Sri Lanka from the USA/Japan, for the purpose of conversion from left to right-hand drive (RHD) and other modifications, before being imported into India by mis-declaring the import value by using fabricated documents. \"In the investigation, it was ascertained that more than 30 Luxury Cars, viz models like Hummer EV, Cadillac Escalade, Rolls-Royce, Lexus, Toyota Land Cruiser & Lincoln Navigator, have been imported by using the above modus operandi. The importers involved are based in Hyderabad, Mumbai, Pune, Ahmedabad, Bangalore & Delhi with estimated duty evasion of more than \u20b925 crores,\" the ministry said. DRI has arrested one of the biggest importers involved in this commercial fraud, based in Hyderabad, who has imported 8 such high-end luxury cars involving customs duty evasion of more than \u20b97 crore.

Gavaskar, who regards them as colossal figures in Indian cricket, does not believe that their recent Test retirement and last year's T20 retirement will have a bearing in enhancing their chances of playing the 2027 showpiece. \"No, I don't think they will be playing,\" Gavaskar told 'Sports Today'. \"...I'm being very honest, I don't think they'll be there. But who knows in the next year or so, they strike this rich vein of form and they keep scoring hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and even God can't drop them.\" The pair was instrumental in India's Champions Trophy triumph earlier this year. \"Well, they have been massive performers in this format of the game. Do we feel that they will be in the team for the 2027 World Cup? Will they be able to make the kind of contribution they have been making? \"So that's going to be the thought process of the selection committee. And if the selection committee feels that 'yes', they will still be making that huge contribution that they have been making, then both of them will be there for that,\" added Gavaskar. The former India captain wasn't surprised by Kohli's timing and said both players might have taken the decision after conversations with selectors, and appreciated that they exited on their own terms. \"...for both these wonderful, wonderful cricketers to go out on their own terms is what everybody wanted and that's what has happened. They have gone out where they have told the world that they have had enough.\" Gavaskar gave credit to the current chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar for working in the interest of Indian cricket. \"I've never been a selector, so I wouldn't know. But that is exactly what you want to do. You want to see the growth of the team. You want to see the team move forward at pace. You don't want to see the team move forward sluggishly. \"Sometimes you've got to take hard decisions, hard calls, because that's what this game demands,\" he said. Bumrah for Test captain Gavaskar backed Jasprit Bumrah to be India's next Test captain, dismissing workload concerns around the injury-prone pacer. \"Jasprit Bumrah for me... if you appoint somebody else, they will always want an extra over from Bumrah because he's your number one bowler capable of taking a wicket any time, you want that extra over. \"But Bumrah being the captain himself would know that 'look, this is the time that I must take a break. Yes, I've got a wicket in my previous over but my body says to me that I need a break',\" he explained his reasons. \"So for me, it's got to be Bumrah only. I know there's kind of speculation going on about workload, but give it to him so he knows exactly how many overs to bowl, when to take himself off, when to sort of rest. So that would be the best thing.\" On Rohit's retirement, Gavaskar said he never chased numbers and played with effortless grace. \"Yes, people might say he could've done more,\" Gavaskar said. \"But Rohit always played for the joy of the game, not for personal milestones. He was content with a quick 60 or 70, taking risks even after getting set. Maybe that cost him a few centuries, but that's what made him who he was -- a player you loved to watch.\""

            "text": "HomeWorld NewsTwenty states sue over Trump's push to link grants to immigration enforcement A coalition of 20 Democratic-led states filed two lawsuits on Tuesday seeking to block President Donald Trump's administration from forcing them to cooperate with immigration enforcement in order to receive billions of dollars in transportation, counter-terrorism, and emergency preparedness grant funding. The states in a pair of lawsuits filed in federal court in Rhode Island argue that the US Department of Transportation and the US Department of Homeland Security are unlawfully using federal funds to coerce them into adhering to the Republican president's hardline immigration agenda. California Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat who is leading the litigation, called the move a \"blatantly illegal\" threat by Trump to yank funds used to improve roads and prepare for emergencies if states do not use their resources to support immigration enforcement. \"He\u2019s treating these funds, which have nothing to do with immigration enforcement and everything to do with the safety of our communities, as a bargaining chip,\" Bonta said in a statement. Also Read: Trump's India Pakistan peace claim a 'warning for the future', not a record of the past: Strategic Affairs Expert The states argue the administration, by imposing immigration-enforcement conditions on grant funding, is unconstitutionally seizing Congress' power over spending. The Departments of Homeland Security and Transportation did not respond immediately to requests for comment. Since returning to office on January 20, Trump has signed several executive orders that have called for cutting off federal funding to so-called sanctuary jurisdictions that do not cooperate with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Such jurisdictions generally have laws and policies that limit or prevent local law enforcement from assisting federal officers with civil immigration arrests. A federal judge has blocked the administration from withholding funding from 16 cities and counties with such laws. The US Department of Justice under Trump has meanwhile filed lawsuits against Illinois, New York, and Colorado challenging laws in those Democratic-led states that it says hinder federal immigration enforcement. One of the lawsuits filed on Tuesday took aim at new requirements the Homeland Security Department had imposed stipulating that states must support federal civil immigration enforcement or risk losing grant funding for emergency preparedness, disaster relief, and cybersecurity. \"DHS is holding states hostage by forcing them to choose between disaster preparedness and enabling the administration\u2019s illegal and chaotic immigration agenda,\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, said in a statement. The second lawsuit focused on a letter US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy sent on April 24 stating that states could lose transportation funding if they fail to cooperate on immigration enforcement efforts or maintain diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.

            "text": "HomeIndia NewsOperation Sindoor sent clear message - terror infrastructure in Pakistan not immune to retaliation, says GK Pillai In his first address to the nation since Operation Sindoor, PM Modi stated that India would not tolerate any form of nuclear threat from Pakistan and advocated for the use of Made in India defence equipment. He added that the temporary cessation of hostilities between India and Pakistan does not signify the end of Operation Sindoor or that India is backing down. He emphasised that this is merely a pause. Modi asserted that India's display of overwhelming force over the past few days was a warning to Pakistan and all other countries. He concluded by stating that India would no longer tolerate terrorism in any form. To discuss the lessons from Operation Sindoor, CNBC-TV18 spoke with GK Pillai, former Home Secretary. Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview. Q: I'd like you to first weigh in on the US role in this crisis. How do you think the US got involved, and what really made Donald Trump go to the extent of saying that they brought India and Pakistan to stop hostilities and stop fighting? Pillai: To an extent, we still do not have full information, but from what has been said, what the Americans have said, and what other news has come out, I think the attacks by the Indian forces on the Pakistani military establishment on the night of the 9th-10th were serious enough that the Pakistanis felt a little threatened about their nuclear weapons cache. I think they then took up the matter with the United States, saying that Pakistan was being put in a position where it might have to react with nuclear weapons. That, I believe, was the point when all the top American officials moved in to intervene. Q: What do you think is the big lesson from Operation Sindoor? We've emerged victorious in terms of hitting terror camps in Pakistan, the command and control centres of the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. We were able to hit Pakistani air bases. But if there were certain lessons from the last week, according to you, which would be the most important? Pillai: I think our initial plan to hit only terrorist bases was completely successful. We don't know the actual number of casualties, but we do know that a few senior leaders of the terrorist groups were killed. The funeral proceedings, which were, in fact, orchestrated by the terrorist groups and attended by senior army officers, are a clear indication that we managed to kill a few senior persons. Some are still there, and I think a very clear message has gone out to them that they are not immune, whether they are close to any army establishment or even within Pakistan, including in the Punjab province. Q: Do you also believe, that it will be very important for India to see how the propaganda war plays out in future? We were very good in terms of fact-checking all the propaganda coming from Pakistan. But do you think this also highlights an aspect of warfare that we must continue to win, not just the PR war between India and Pakistan, but globally as well? Pillai: Yes, I think it's important. There are two important lessons we\u2019ve learned. One is about our own TV channels, which completely deviated from the government\u2019s official position, whether it was the statement by the Foreign Secretary or the armed forces, that we were striking at terrorist camps and would retaliate only against Pakistani military bases. The media went totally berserk, talking about attacks on Karachi and Islamabad, Indian forces crossing the border, and so on, giving the impression that this was an Indian aggression against Pakistan. The media went totally overboard, and we lost the plot a little bit there. The second important point is that with a new administration and a new President of the United States, who, shall I say, speaks off the cuff based on what someone tells him orally, we can clearly see that he is not fully briefed. For example, someone who talks about a 1,000-year war between India and Pakistan, when Pakistan has existed for only 75 years, obviously hasn\u2019t been briefed properly. Therefore, it\u2019s important for us to diplomatically convey India's position far more seriously to the Secretary of State, the Assistant Secretary of State, and others, so that when they brief and talk to the President, he has a much better understanding of the situation. Otherwise, we hear vague references to India, Kashmir, and mediation, without really understanding what the issue is. The Prime Minister did clarify that the issue of mediation relates only to terrorism and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. But I still believe the President of the United States needs to be properly briefed by his staff so that he doesn\u2019t make the kind of mistakes he made in those statements. Q: Do you also believe, that it's now time for India to realise not to put all its eggs in one basket? I'm talking about the India-US relationship. We've invested a lot and given them many concessions since Donald Trump came to power, in terms of trade and non-tariff barriers. Do you think it is time to review our US policy? Pillai: I think we've had a balanced policy. Our foreign policy has been extremely consistent, if I may say so, even going back to Jawaharlal\u2019s time. Even now, we have ties with the United States, Russia, Ukraine, China, and Europe. I think India's foreign policy has been consistent and has always looked after our national interest. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve gone wrong there. We\u2019ve now diversified a bit, with greater reliance on Israel and the United States, but that is only part of the rebalancing exercise we need to do. At one time, we were overdependent on Russia. Q: I'd like to ask you about the high-tech warfare we've seen over the last seven days or so. The Prime Minister also referred to how we were able to dominate Pakistani forces in this new-age technological warfare. Now, as we develop our ground, air, and naval capabilities, what would be the key lesson in terms of our military preparedness, defence budget, and how we utilise it in the most optimum and efficient manner? We've seen one Indo-Pak conflict last week; there could be more in the future. How do we now prepare ourselves for these short but high-tech conflicts? Pillai: I think we have learned from recent global events. If you see the Russia-Ukraine war, where drones have been extensively used, I believe our forces have been watching and learning. I have a great sentimental attachment to the Indian Air Force, and I think they have done very well. They\u2019ve trained, acquired sophisticated weapons, including drones. Our air defence system has also proven to be very effective, it managed to prevent most missile attacks on military bases within India. That\u2019s a success. But we now have to keep upgrading our technology, because every country learns from its last war. Even if it's not a full-scale war but a skirmish lasting three to four days, adversaries will come up with new weapons and tactics. We must be fully prepared, including in cyber security, because people will try to infiltrate systems and break them down without even firing a shot. Q: India is still hunting for those who were involved, those three or four terrorists involved in the Pahalgam attack. Yes, we've eliminated their masterminds and command-and-control centres in Pakistan. But what do you think is the big internal security challenge from Pakistan, and from General Munir, that India will need to be careful about and prepared for in the coming months and years? Pillai: One very positive development we've seen is the attitude of the people of Kashmir. I think we need to reach out more to them and bring them further into our fold. They are already willing to come and be mainstreamed, in one sense, and they realise what Pakistan can do. It\u2019s important for us to build on this. That said, I think our counter-intelligence and counter-terrorist grid in Jammu & Kashmir clearly failed. The fact that we allowed people to come in, shoot for 10, 20, 30 minutes, and then escape without interception is a definite failure. The security forces will have to learn from that and ensure such incidents don\u2019t happen in the future. There are also reports that someone had been looking at the Pahalgam satellite maps in February, March, and April. These are indications that an active research and analysis wing, especially in the United States, should have picked up. If someone is studying satellite maps of a particular area, that should have triggered alerts or red flags."

The company anticipates a significant \"windfall\" in its insulin business and sees a massive opportunity in GLP-1 therapies for diabetes and obesity. Mazumdar-Shaw said she sees Biocon filling the void left by the large pharmaceutical companies who are exiting or reducing their footprint in insulins to focus on high-margin GLP-1 products. \"When you look into FY26, I think we will see some very strong growth in all of our businesses,\" Mazumdar-Shaw said in an interview with Moneycontrol Shaw highlighted that Biocon is uniquely positioned as the only global company with the scale to address the growing gap in the insulin market, as other players pivot towards GLP-1s. Biocon has recently doubled its insulin manufacturing capacity in Malaysia to capitalise on this trend. A key driver for FY26 will be the company's expanding presence in the burgeoning GLP-1 market. Following the launch of liraglutide in the UK, Biocon is gearing up for its European Union launch in FY26 and is also eyeing the U.S. market. Also read: Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw on how Trump\u2019s order aims to fix US drug price gap \"Biocon has a huge opportunity in GLP-1 starting with liraglutide this year. But even a bigger one is starting end of next year, which is semaglutide in emerging markets,\" Mazumdar-Shaw added. The company boasts end-to-end capabilities in both insulins and GLP-1s, a differentiating factor in the competitive landscape. The Generics division is also poised for a strong FY26 with a recovery in the API business, supported by cost improvements, operational efficiencies, and new capacities coming online. While launch supplies of generic Lenalidomide were significant in Q4 FY25, growth in FY26 will be driven by other new launches until Lenalidomide volumes become unlimited from January 2026. Biocon Biologics, the company's biosimilars arm, is set to launch five new products over the next 12-18 months, including biosimilars for Stelara or ustekinumab (already launched in the U.S.), Bevacizumab, Aspart, Aflibercept (U.S. launch expected no later than H2 2026), and Denosumab. Syngene, Biocon's research services subsidiary, also expects the positive momentum from the latter half of FY25 to continue into FY26, projecting mid-single-digit revenue growth. Mazumdar-Shaw emphasised that FY25 served as an \"inflexion year,\" setting the stage for accelerated growth. The company is focused on reaping the benefits of substantial investments made across its businesses. Also read: Metropolis Healthcare Q4 net slips 19% but revenue up 4%; TruHealth shines"

            "text": "HomeTravel NewsFood & Drinks NewsThis Mumbai restaurant expands its Italian roots with wider Mediterranean flavours Pizza, pasta, risotto, gelato may be popularly synonymous with Italy. But, in reality, the entire Mediterranean region has come together to shape these Italian dishes \u2014 and the celebrated Italian cuisine in general. \"Italy has always been a strategic hub for global commerce,\" says chef Roberto Apa. Starting with the expansion of the ancient Roman Empire, it left an indelible mark on culture, culinary recipes and ingredients.. \"Later, Italy's strategic location and favourable climate made it a coveted land, leading to numerous attempted conquests and colonisations by the Spanish, French and the Arabs. These influences significantly enriched the Italian culinary traditions,\" he adds. Chef Apa, who says his culinary journey began at the age of 12 years old when he was making pasta dough with his aunt during lunchtime, is now at the helm of the iconic Mezzo Mezzo restaurant at JW Marriott Mumbai Juhu. The restaurant, which has been a favourite among locals, recently reopened in a new avatar. Considering the Mediterranean history, the question that comes to mind is if the restaurant has expanded beyond its Italian roots or simply enriched them further. Chef Apa says the first dishes and concepts for the new Mezzo Mezzu menu were developed long before his journey started with JW Marriott Mumbai Juhu. \"In terms of inspiration, the Mezzo Mezzo menu is deeply rooted in Italian culinary traditions and influenced by the ancient ways of Persia, as well as a myriad of European and Mediterranean flavours that enrich the modern European cuisine,\" he says. It also reflects his personal culinary journey, which has taken him to countries such as Greece, Monte Carlo, China, India and Qatar. Apa has blended the two cuisines, which he says wasn\u2019t difficult. \"The combination of diverse ingredients we use today in our menu has not been particularly challenging, as it naturally stems from this rich history of cultural integration,\u201d he says. This reflects in dishes like Chicken Pide, which is spiced with za'atar, lemon and garlic aioli; the Hamachi Carpaccio, a tiger milk ponzu with picked onion, avocado mousse and crunchy red quinoa; the Lamb Souvlaki \u2014 a New Zealand lamb loin, sesame garlic labneh and leeks; and Australian Lamb Shank, with saffron risotto, gremolata, jus, to name a few. The Roots Gnocchi seems too colourful a dish to dig into\u2014 until one digs in. Each coloured gnocchi has a distinct flavour because the dough is made with five different roots \u2014 beetroot, sweet potato, yam, purple potato and pickled root. The pizza though remains the pristine sourdough Neapolitan pizza. \"The pizza is classic. Other dishes have been elevated with spices and techniques. However, the pizza dough requires 72 hours of proofing. We require three days to make a pizza,\" he says. There are few restaurants in Mumbai that serve seriously good pasta \u2014 Mezzo Mezzo's Truffle Tagliatelle ensures it belongs that rare, exclusive club. Their pasta and risotto section is extensive with multiple options for vegetarians and non-vegetarians. The restaurant's cocktail canvas too dives into the theme of Italian-Mediterranean fusion, with Baklava Gin, Strawberry Tequila, Olive Oil Cake Rum, Truffle Chocolate Whiskey Vodka, and more \u2014 and I can vouch for the fact that these cocktails actually taste like a baklava, or a cheesecake, or truffle chocolate, tazatziki. Not to be missed. There is also a Twisted Classics section, which comprises cocktails such as smoked Salsa Picante, Pine Highball, Berry Brew, Floral Bubble, Pear Cinnamon Highball and more."

            "text": "HomeMarket NewsWill the US-China trade deal dampen foreign flows to Indian markets again? Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have infused nearly $3 billion into Indian equities since March, drawn by the country\u2019s relative stability amid global tariff tensions and optimism around a corporate earnings revival. However, this momentum now appears to be waning. According to market participants, a possible reversal in foreign flows could be driven by the latest developments in the US-China trade deal. \u201cA flow reversal to the US due to a stronger dollar and higher allocations to China in emerging markets will likely cap FII inflows to India in the near term,\u201d BofA Securities wrote in an investor note. Domestic institutional investor (DII) activity has also moderated. DIIs\u2014which include mutual funds, insurers, and banks\u2014purchased $6.1 billion worth of equities in April, a drop from the $8.6 billion peak seen in October. \u201cWe expect DII flows to remain volatile as potential market rally could trigger profit booking, while any corrections may attract sharp inflows,\u201d BofA added. While FPIs bought $1.3 billion worth of Indian shares in April, their enthusiasm has been sector-specific. Financial stocks were favored, while IT stocks continued to be avoided due to concerns around a US growth slowdown. Still, India stands out among emerging markets in terms of foreign flows, with a net inflow of $2.7 billion quarter-to-date. In contrast, South Korea has seen sharp outflows of $6.7 billion since April, while Taiwan attracted $4.4 billion in inflows\u2014largely driven by its semiconductor sector, which remains exempt from recent US tariffs.

            "text": "HomeWorld NewsTrump, Saudi crown prince sign host of agreements as US leader begins 4-day Mideast tour US President Donald Trump signed a host of economic and bilateral cooperation agreements in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday as he kicked off a four-day Middle East trip with a focus on dealmaking with a key Mideast ally while shared concerns about Iran's nuclear programme and the war in Gaza dragged on in the background. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi de facto ruler, warmly greeted Trump as he stepped off Air Force One at King Khalid International Airport in the Saudi capital. \u201cI really believe we like each other a lot,\u201d Trump said later during a brief appearance with the crown prince at the start of a bilateral meeting. They later signed more than a dozen agreements to increase cooperation between their governments' militaries, justice departments and cultural institutions. Additional economic agreements were expected to be inked later Tuesday at a US-Saudi investment conference convened for the occasion. Prince Mohammed has already committed to some $600 billion in new Saudi investment in the US, but Trump teased $1 trillion would be even better. Fighter jet escort The pomp began before Trump even landed. Royal Saudi Air Force F-15s provided an honorary escort for Air Force One as it approached the kingdom's capital \u2014 an exceptionally rare sight. Trump and Prince Mohammed also took part in a formal greeting and lunch at the Royal Court at Al Yamamah Palace, gathering with guests and aides in an ornate room with blue and gold accents and massive crystal chandeliers. As he greeted business titans with Trump by his side, Prince Mohammed was animated and smiling. It was a stark contrast to his awkward fist bump with then-President Joe Biden, who looked to avoid being seen on camera shaking hands with the prince during a 2022 visit to the kingdom. Biden had decided to pay a visit to Saudi Arabia as he looked to alleviate soaring prices at the pump for motorists at home and around the globe. At the time, Prince Mohammed's reputation had been badly damaged by a US intelligence determination that found he had ordered the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But that dark moment appeared to be distant memory for the prince as he rubbed elbows with high-profile business executives \u2014 including Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk \u2014 in front of the cameras and with Trump by his side. Later, the crown prince will fete Trump with an intimate state dinner at Ad-Diriyah, a UNESCO heritage site that is the birthplace of the first Saudi state and the site of a major development project championed by the crown prince. Oil production Saudi Arabia and fellow OPEC+ nations have already helped their cause with Trump early in his second term by stepping up oil production. Trump sees cheap energy as a key component to lowering costs and stemming inflation for Americans. The Republican president has also made the case that lower oil prices will hasten an end to the Russia-Ukraine war. But Saudi Arabia's economy remains heavily dependent on oil, and the kingdom needs a fiscal break-even oil price of $96 to $98 a barrel to balance its budget. It's questionable how long OPEC+, of which Saudi Arabia is the leading member, is willing to keep production elevated. The price of a barrel of Brent crude closed Monday at $64.77. Qatar and UAE next Trump picked the kingdom for his first stop, because it has pledged to make big investments in the US, but he ended up travelling to Italy last month for Pope Francis' funeral. Riyadh was the first overseas stop of his first term. The three countries on Trump's itinerary \u2014 Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 are places where the Trump Organisation, run by Trump's two oldest sons, is developing major real estate projects. They include a high-rise tower in Jeddah, a luxury hotel in Dubai and a golf course and villa complex in Qatar. Trump is trying to demonstrate that his transactional strategy for international politics is paying dividends as he faces criticism from Democrats who say his global tariff war and approach to Russia's war on Ukraine are isolating the US from allies. He's expected to announce deals with the three wealthy countries that will touch on artificial intelligence, expanding energy cooperation and perhaps new arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The administration this month announced initial approval to sell $3.5 billion worth of air-to-air missiles for Saudi Arabia's fighter jets. But Trump arrived in the Middle East when his top regional allies, Israel and Saudi Arabia, are far from neatly aligned with his approach. Trump's decision to skip Israel is remarkable, expert says. Before the trip, Trump announced Washington was halting a nearly two-month US airstrike campaign against Yemen's Houthis, saying the Iran-backed rebels have pledged to stop attacking ships along a vital global trade route. The administration didn't notify Israel, which the Houthis continue to target, of the agreement before Trump publicly announced it. It was the latest example of Trump leaving the Israelis in the dark about his administration's negotiations with common adversaries. In March, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't notified by the administration until after talks began with Hamas about the war in Gaza. And Netanyahu found out about the ongoing US nuclear talks with Iran only when Trump announced them during an Oval Office visit by the Israeli leader last month. \u201cIsrael will defend itself by itself,\u201d Netanyahu said last week following Trump's Houthi truce announcement. \u201cIf others join us \u2014 our American friends \u2014 all the better.\" William Wechsler, senior director of the Rafik Hariri Center and Middle East Programs at the Atlantic Council, said Trump's decision to skip Israel on his first Middle East visit is remarkable. \u201cThe main message coming out of this, at least as the itinerary stands today, is that the governments of the Gulf \u2026 are in fact stronger friends to President Trump than the current government of Israel at this moment,\u201d Wechsler said. Restarting efforts to normalise Israel-Saudi ties Trump, meanwhile, hopes to restart his first-term effort to normalise relations between the Middle East's major powers, Israel and Saudi Arabia. Trump's Abraham Accords effort led to Sudan, the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco agreeing to normalise relations with Israel. But Riyadh has made clear that in exchange for normalisation it wants US security guarantees, assistance with the kingdom's nuclear programme and progress on a pathway to Palestinian statehood. There seems to be scant hope for making headway on a Palestinian state with the Israel-Hamas war raging and the Israelis threatening to flatten and occupy Gaza. Prince Mohammed last week notably hosted Palestinian Vice President Hussein al-Sheikh in Jeddah on the official's first foreign visit since assuming office in April."

            "text": "HomeEconomy NewsIndustry seeks major reforms on input tax credit rules to boost cash flows, operational efficiencies: Sources In yet another plea to improve the intricacies under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, financial experts and industry leaders have approached the government, proposing a series of sweeping reforms aimed at easing the bottlenecks for the industry, particularly with regard to the Input Tax Credit (ITC) framework. The move comes amid widespread concerns about mounting credit accumulation and liquidity constraints faced by businesses under the current GST system, which has been impacting business liquidity, said sources familiar with the development. \u201cThe current system has created substantial working capital challenges for businesses across sectors, prompting calls for immediate intervention,\u201d said sources quoting the representations, which have been submitted to the revenue department at the Finance Ministry. Also, as part of these representations, there are recommendations \u201cseeking a comprehensive review of the ITC mechanism, with the aim to address structural bottlenecks that have stifled working capital efficiency across sectors. Key issues identified include mandatory cash payments under the Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM), the inability to transfer credits between different branches of the same company, and the lack of a streamlined refund process for unutilised ITC,\u201d sources added. Industry claims that \u201cbusinesses are facing ITC accumulation due to multiple factors, including the absence of corresponding outward supplies, mandatory cash payments under the Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM), and restrictions on transferring accumulated ITC between distinct entities. These issues have particularly impacted companies in their early stages and those with high capital outlays,\u201d said sources. Key reforms proposed by industry One of the most significant proposals calls for allowing businesses to use their accumulated ITC to discharge RCM liabilities. Under the current regime, companies must pay such taxes in cash, even when they possess sufficient input credit. Experts argue that this places unnecessary financial strain on businesses, especially those in capital-intensive or early-growth stages. \u201cThis reform would align India\u2019s GST practices with those in the European Union and Singapore, where fully creditable businesses do not bear a cash burden under reverse charge provisions,\u201d said a senior tax expert who did not wish to be named. Another major recommendation involves introducing a systematic refund mechanism for ITC accumulated at the end of each financial year. \u201cThe suggested model draws from the practices in the United Kingdom and Italy and includes two possible approaches: allowing refunds for credits unlikely to be utilised within three years, or enabling businesses to claim a fixed percentage of accumulated ITC annually,\u201d said a CFO of a leading MNC operating in India. In a move widely welcomed by corporates, the reform package also proposes enabling the transfer of IGST and CGST credit balances between distinct persons under the same PAN\u2014such as separate registrations of a company across different states. \u201cIndustry leaders believe this would optimise credit utilisation and improve overall business efficiency,\u201d said sources. Addressing long-standing industry demands The review also calls for expanding the refund formula applicable to inverted duty structures to include ITC on input services. Currently, only inputs (goods) are eligible for such refunds, leaving service-heavy industries at a disadvantage. Perhaps the most innovative suggestion is the creation of a mechanism to convert accumulated ITC into marketable scrips or tradable credits. This approach, similar to carbon or export scrip models, would allow businesses to monetise unused credits, thus unlocking much-needed liquidity without breaching GST compliance. Implications for exporters and economic growth Export-oriented businesses are expected to benefit significantly from the proposed changes, particularly through lower production costs and improved international competitiveness. \u201cThese reforms could enable exporters to reinvest capital and expand globally, thereby positioning India more strongly in global trade,\u201d said a prominent export association official. Beyond individual business benefits, the proposed reforms could have a broader economic impact. By reducing blocked capital and enhancing credit flow, the changes are expected to stimulate investment, support job creation, and contribute to India\u2019s post-pandemic economic recovery. Looking Ahead The proposed reforms, as per industry claims, have the potential to create a more efficient and business-friendly tax ecosystem. Industry leaders are now urging the government to act swiftly on these recommendations. However, these recommendations are currently at the drawing board and nothing has been finalised by the revenue department, said sources. But, if implemented, these reforms could transform the GST system from a compliance-heavy regime into a growth enabler, claim the industry representations. The government\u2019s response to these proposals will be closely watched in the coming months, as businesses and investors alike await decisive steps toward a more liquid and equitable ITC system."

MEA also brought attention to direct linkages between the perpetrators of the Pahalgam attack and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). It was revealed that TRF had initially accepted responsibility for the attack, only to retract later under the direction of its handlers. TRF, a front organization for LeT, continues to be a major focus in India's ongoing investigation, MEA emphasized. Additionally, India countered Pakistan\u2019s claims regarding its attacks on Indian territory. \"I urge you to look at the sites which Pakistan claims to have attacked in India. Contrast it with these sites and places that we successfully targeted and destroyed. That will give you a clear answer,\" MEA said. MEA also addressed speculation around nuclear escalation, underscoring that Pakistan's own leadership had denied such a dimension in the conflict. \"Pakistan FM has himself denied the nuclear angle on record,\" MEA pointed out.

            "text": "The negotiations aim to secure early mutual wins through an interim trade arrangement, with the first phase of the agreement expected by fall 2025. Chief negotiators will meet separately from May 19-22. Key agenda points include market access, rules of origin, and non-tariff barriers. India's proposal to impose retaliatory duties on certain US products A 90-day tariff pause provides an opportunity to advance negotiations, with the US suspending an additional 26% tariffs on India until July 9, while a 10% baseline tariff remains in place. To give impetus to the talks, India's Chief Negotiator for BTA Rajesh Agrawal, special secretary in the Department of Commerce, and Assistant US Trade Representative for South and Central Asia Brendan Lynch had last month held three-day talks in Washington. India seeks duty concessions for labour-intensive sectors including textiles, gems & jewellery, leather goods, plastics, chemicals, and agricultural products. Meanwhile, the US aims for concessions on industrial goods, EVs, wines, dairy, and agro-products like apples and tree nuts. The terms of reference (ToRs) for the BTA cover 19 chapters, including tariffs, goods, services, customs facilitation, and non-tariff barriers, which the US has repeatedly raised concerns over in the Indian market. The US remains India's biggest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching USD 131.84 billion in 2024-25, accounting for 18% of India's exports and 6.22% of imports. India maintained a USD 41.18 billion trade surplus in goods, a point of concern for Washington. The rules of origin provision, designed to prevent third-country goods from being dumped in India, will also be a critical part of discussions. The 2025 National Trade Estimate (NTE) Report cites India's various non-tariff barriers, including restrictions on specific animal-origin products, pharmaceuticals, IT items, and agriculture imports. Indian exporters also face similar barriers in the US and China. India and the US continue sectoral talks, aiming for balanced concessions to strengthen bilateral trade ties.

            "text": "HomeReal Estate NewsIndia\u2019s retail real estate set for record boom, more than 16 mn sqft of new mall space by 2026: report India's retail sector is poised for historic expansion, with a record 16.6 million sq. ft. of Grade A mall space expected to be completed across the country\u2019s top seven cities by the end of 2026. According to the latest research by ANAROCK, a real estate consultancy firm, this surge marks a major leap in organised retail supply after years of supply-demand mismatch. Leading this growth are Hyderabad and Delhi-NCR, which together will contribute nearly 65% of the new retail space, reaffirming their position as the country\u2019s most promising consumption hubs. The research reflects a broader trend of rising consumer demand, fuelled by increasing incomes, urbanisation, and the entry of global retail brands into the Indian market. What is Grade A mall space? In India, \"Grade A mall space\" refers to high-quality, large-scale retail developments that meet stringent standards in design, location, tenant mix, and operational management. These malls typically have a Gross Leasable Area (GLA) of over 500,000 sq. ft., are strategically located in high-traffic urban areas with excellent connectivity, and feature a curated mix of national and international brands. Management is generally professional and efficient, ensuring high occupancy and customer satisfaction. Recovery from supply crunch ANAROCK also notes that this upswing in mall supply follows a period of constrained development. Between 2022 and 2024, leasing demand significantly outpaced new supply: In 2022, only 2.6 Mn sq. ft. of new space was delivered, while leasing reached 3.2 Mn sq. ft. In 2023, 5.3 Mn sq. ft. was added versus 6.5 Mn sq. ft. leased In 2024, new supply dropped to 1.1 Mn sq. ft. as state and general elections slowed approval processes. Leasing, however, remained high at 6.5 Mn sq. ft. \u201cThe surge is also prompted by a perceivable shortfall in new supply of Grade A malls across cities. The previous three-year data trends show that new mall supply in the top 7 cities did not match the overall leasing. In 2022, these cities witnessed approx. 2.6 Mn sq. ft. of new Grade A retail supply, while leasing clocked in at approx. 3.2 Mn sq. ft. Likewise, 2023 saw 5.3 Mn sq. ft. of new Grade A mall supply, while 6.5 Mn sq. ft. were leased. The demand-supply imbalance over the past few years is now correcting itself,\u201d said Anuj Kejriwal, CEO & MD of ANAROCK Retail. \u201cThe sector is entering a high-growth phase, with developers and retailers alike showing strong confidence.\u201d Leasing confidence and global brand entry ANAROCK\u2019s report also notes that leasing activity remains robust, with over 12.6 Mn sq. ft. projected to be leased across 2025 and 2026. A key driver of this momentum is the entry of more than 60 international brands across fashion, electronics, lifestyle, and food & beverage sectors in the past four years. These brands are driving demand for high-grade, organised retail spaces, particularly in premium malls and high-footfall commercial streets. As a result, mall developers are increasingly focusing on quality and location, with a clear shift toward Grade A developments. Vacancy rates stabelising While the supply surge raises concerns about potential oversupply, data indicates a healthy absorption trend. ANAROCK estimates that vacancy rates in top cities will stabilise at 8.2% in 2025 and 8.5% in 2026\u2014significantly lower than the pandemic peak of 15.5% in 2021. This stability reflects renewed consumer sentiment and stronger footfalls across both urban and suburban retail hubs. Retail boom spills into Bharat While metro cities continue to dominate mall development, Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities are emerging as strong retail engines. Rising disposable incomes and increased digital penetration are driving e-commerce activity in these regions. In FY 2024, ~56% of online shopping came from non-metro cities This figure is expected to reach 64% by FY 2030 India\u2019s online shopper base grew from 140 million in 2020 to 260 million in 2024 It is projected to reach 300 million by 2030 and 700 million by 2035 These trends suggest that India\u2019s consumption story is no longer metro-centric. As digital commerce expands in smaller towns, brick-and-mortar retail in these areas is also gaining traction, attracting interest from both developers and investors. Strong fundamentals mitigate oversupply risks Despite the aggressive pipeline, analysts believe that India\u2019s retail real estate market is not at immediate risk of oversupply. High leasing rates, brand expansion, and growing consumer demand continue to support sustained absorption. The structural shift in Indian retail\u2014from fragmented local markets to organised, tech-integrated experiences\u2014is strengthening the long-term appeal of mall investments. Developers are expected to remain cautious, with a strong focus on quality execution and tenant mix. India\u2019s retail landscape is undergoing a profound transformation. The next two years will not just be about adding space, but about enhancing experiences, integrating technology, and capturing the attention of a billion consumers in both metro and non-metro India. If current trends continue, the country could be on the brink of a new golden era for retail real estate, with organised malls playing a central role in shaping the future of consumption."

            "text": "HomeSports NewsThe Mumbai training camp in 2014 that sparked Virat Kohli's rise as a Test batsman Perhaps the biggest jolt to Virat Kohli's fledgling career had come in 2014 when James Anderson toyed around his batting technique and ensured that the Indian star endured a challenging tour of England, scoring just 134 runs across five games. Upon returning to India, Kohli called up his U-19 coach Lalchand Rajput, and received inputs from Sachin Tendulkar, as he underwent a two-week-long practice camp in Mumbai to fix the drawbacks in his approach towards swinging conditions. \"I had known him from Under-19 days and we had a good rapport because I could understand him. I had spent a good amount of time with him \u2014 from 2006 to 2007 with India U19. So, it was good to get a call from him after that England tour in 2014, where he never had a good series,\" Rajput told PTI from Netherlands. \"We had a two-week camp in Mumbai. had already improved a lot as a batter from his U19 days, and it was clear that he was on his way to become a great player. It was a matter of working on a few areas closely. \"His head was falling a little bit and his footwork was a little indecisive. So, we worked on those areas a bit. He has always been receptive and adaptive as a batter, and he did that here too as he quickly made the changes before going to Australia,\" said Rajput. Those couple of weeks revamped Kohli's game as he went on to have a fantastic tour of Australia later that year, aggregating 692 runs across four encounters, including four centuries. \"He just believes in excellence. He doesn't want to be number 2, he always wants to be number 1. That is his hunger and pride for what he plays for,\" he said. Rajput, however, is taken aback by Kohli's abrupt retirement from the longest format, given how passionate he was towards the red ball format. \"I would always say that he is so fit, he could have played a couple of seasons more. He is so fit and passionate that I feel that he has plenty of cricket left in him. \"We would love to see him, but again it is his personal decision and he must have thought about it a lot before taking it and we have to respect it,\" he added. The tactician understands that the cricketing fraternity will be missing his lively presence in the longest format of the game. \"He really liked Test cricket and he has always advocated it. He always believed that Test cricket should be taken very seriously and he showed it by the way he used to go about in Test cricket. I think Test cricket has been very alive because of him. \"I don't know what the future holds, but definitely Test cricket will miss him. The cricket community overall will miss him,\" he noted."

            "text": "Tredence\u2019s story begins in 2013, when a team of six set out to solve a stubborn analytics gap: the last-mile AI problem. Organisations were spending heavily on data projects, yet insights rarely reached day-to-day decision-makers. Tredence pledged to close that gap, and in barely a decade has grown into a 3,500-strong global force in AI and data science. Much of that momentum flows from Tredence\u2019s reputation as a career springboard for elite talent. Learning is not a perk here; it is the operating system. New hires enter personalised pathways that mix technical mastery with deep industry immersion. Whether they work in retail, CPG, or healthcare, engineers and data scientists move beyond code to master merchandising levers, dynamic pricing, patient-centric workflows and supply-chain dynamics. Instead of handing over glossy dashboards that gather dust, Tredence teams invest in adoption strategies, user training and operational readiness. That last-mile rigour is why clients see real ROI rather than shelf-ware. The company also refuses to separate domain consulting from data science. On a typical consumer-goods assignment, supply-chain specialists and data scientists share the same war room\u2014and the same performance metrics. The cross-functional model pays off: one retailer\u2019s media network saw ad revenue quadruple in a year, while a regional grocery chain unlocked more than $200 million through sharper demand forecasting. Tredence\u2019s fearless approach to innovation amplifies this domain focus. Spotting the potential of generative and agentic AI early, the firm created Milky Way Agents\u2014autonomous helpers that learn continuously, orchestrate workflows and relieve humans of repetitive grind. These AI-driven assistants sift vast data sets, flag anomalies and surface instant insights, freeing people to concentrate on strategy and creativity. Augmentation, not substitution, is the goal. A culture of relentless upskilling keeps that engine humming. Company-wide hackathons throw recruits and veterans alike into real-time industry challenges; internal academies, global collaborations and peer mentorship ensure skills stay current as AI evolves. Curiosity is institutionalised, risk-taking celebrated and rapid iteration the norm. Strategic partnerships extend that edge. Tredence collaborates with hyperscalers such as Google, AWS and Microsoft, and with data platforms like Databricks and Snowflake. Sitting on product advisory boards gives the firm early line-of-sight into road-maps and lets it co-develop domain accelerators. Clients gain faster access to cutting-edge capabilities\u2014be it a tailored generative-AI engine for retail content or a specialised ML pipeline for healthcare analytics. Commercial wins aside, Tredence is leaning into social and industry-wide impact. Supply-chain optimisation work reduces waste\u2014a gain for both the environment and the bottom line\u2014while AI-driven patient-engagement models help providers coordinate care more effectively. The message: data-driven decisions can create more sustainable and equitable outcomes when wielded responsibly. The road ahead is audacious. Tredence aims to become the most indispensable AI and data-science partner for half of the Fortune 500. I In April 2025 it welcomed Further Advisory\u2014a banking and financial-services consulting firm\u2014into the fold to help global BFSI clients modernise faster, manage risk smarter and unlock scalable growth. Rather than bracing for disruption, Tredence frames agentic AI as the next logical step in professional services and plans to guide enterprises through that landscape, marrying data-modernisation efforts with domain-led solutions built for complex realities. From a three-bedroom apartment to a trusted ally of global giants, Tredence proves that genuine innovation fuses fearless experimentation with an obsession for outcomes. As industries race to embed AI, the company stands ready with domain fluency, agentic-AI firepower, strategic partnerships and a growing commitment to social value. Just as Disney expanded from a single animation studio into a storytelling empire by blending content, experience and technology, Tredence is stitching together an enterprise-AI ecosystem designed for impact at scale\u2014showing that the journey from insight to action can be swift, meaningful and transformative when fuelled by fearless execution."

On Monday, Shiv Sena leader Murji Patel led a delegation to Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL), calling for an end to its association with Celebi NAS Airport Services, which currently handles around 70% of ground operations at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport. \u201cTurkey may not be firing weapons directly, but supplying drones that are used to target our borders is no less than a hostile act,\u201d said Patel. \u201cWe cannot allow a country that supports our enemy to make money off Indian infrastructure.\u201d The Sena has given MIAL a 10-day deadline to cancel the contract, warning of protests if no action is taken. According to Patel, the party has already met with the airport\u2019s CEO, who has promised to review the matter and respond within the timeframe. The protest has found support beyond political circles. Traders from Pune have backed the Sena\u2019s demand and announced a halt on importing Turkish products, signalling a wider move towards economic disengagement from countries seen as aiding Pakistan. Sena leaders insisted the demand was not politically motivated but based on national interest. \u201cThis is not a business issue\u2014it\u2019s a matter of principle,\u201d said a party worker. \u201cWe are talking about a country that helps arm our enemies.

The Shiv Sena\u2019s demand reflects this sentiment, drawing attention to foreign firms operating in sectors linked to critical infrastructure. Whether or not MIAL acts within the 10-day window, the Sena\u2019s message is clear: companies from nations that support hostile actions against India should not be allowed to operate in key infrastructure projects. The party\u2019s warning reinforces a broader view that in a time of heightened external threats, national security must take precedence over commercial interests.

According to government counsel Narendra Sharma, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) had filed a chargesheet against the eleven accused \u2014 Subhash, Papan, Manvir, Vinod, Pramod, Narender, Ram Kishan, Ramkumar, Mohit, Vijay, and Rajender \u2014 under Indian Penal Code sections 395 (dacoity) and 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc.). The case was registered based on a complaint filed by Umerdeen, a resident of Lisadh village under Phugana police station. He alleged that a mob had broken into his home on September 8, 2013, during the communal violence in Muzaffarnagar. The attackers allegedly looted cash and jewellery worth lakhs of rupees and later set his house on fire, Sharma said. Following the incident, Umerdeen and his family fled the village and took shelter in Jhinjhana town of Shamli district, he said. The Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013 had left over 60 people dead and thousands displaced, leading to multiple cases being investigated by the SIT.

The April print marked the sixth consecutive monthly decline in headline inflation, helped by a steep drop in vegetable and pulse prices. Food inflation cooled sharply to 1.78% from 2.69% in March, while rural and urban inflation dipped to 2.92% and 3.36%, respectively. Sakshi Gupta, Vice President and Senior Economist at HDFC Bank, noted that April\u2019s figure was close to their forecast of 3.11%, adding, \u201cContinued decline in cereals and pulses is encouraging and bodes well for future CPI prints. We expect inflation to stay between 3-3.2% for the next two months.\u201d She projected FY26 CPI at 3.7%, with a terminal repo rate of 5.5% and two rate cuts \u2014 one each in June and August. ICRA Chief Economist Aditi Nayar flagged a likely dip in June inflation and expected FY26 CPI at 3.5%, well below RBI\u2019s 4% target. \u201cThat opens up space for rate cuts,\u201d she said, pencilling in a 75 bps cut in this cycle, starting with a 25 bps reduction in the upcoming policy. Anubhuti Sahay of Standard Chartered Bank also said Q1FY26 inflation might undershoot RBI\u2019s forecast, citing a benign food inflation trajectory and falling global commodity prices. \u201cWe expect average FY26 CPI at 4%, with a downside risk. If growth decelerates, we might see further cuts,\u201d she said, maintaining a terminal repo rate view of 5.5%. ALSO READ | US inflation slows in April despite tariffs, down 0.1% from March Devang Shah, Head of Fixed Income at Axis Mutual Fund, too expects softer inflation over the next two months. \u201cLooking at the CPI trajectory, a 35 bps rate cut is given,\u201d he said, noting that global cues would also influence domestic bond markets. Economists, however, cautioned that seasonal spikes in vegetable prices remain a risk. But for now, the sharp and broad-based cooling in prices has opened the door for the RBI to consider policy easing \u2014 especially as inflation appears likely to stay below its 4% target in the near term."

            "text": "HomeWorld NewsUS inflation slows in April despite tariffs, down 0.1% from March Inflation in the United States slowed for the third consecutive month in April, despite new rounds of import tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump. However, many economists believe this respite may be temporary, with price pressures likely to intensify over the coming months. Figures released by the US Labour Department on Tuesday show consumer prices rose 2.3% in April compared with the same period last year, down from 2.4% in March \u2014 the smallest annual increase in more than four years. On a monthly basis, prices edged up 0.2% after falling 0.1% in March, which had marked the first monthly decline in five years. President Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 including a 10% universal duty imposed in early April and steep levies on steel, aluminium and Chinese imports \u2014 have yet to show their full effect on consumer prices. A significant reduction in US tariffs on Chinese goods, from 145% to 30%, was announced on Monday as part of a trade agreement between the two countries. Nonetheless, economists estimate the average US tariff now stands at 18%, about six times higher than before Trump took office. Items already in transit when the tariffs were announced are exempt from duties, and many businesses have stocked up in advance, allowing them to delay passing on the costs to consumers. That lag, however, is unlikely to last. Tariffs on goods such as furniture, clothing, and agricultural products from Mexico may already be pushing up some prices. Car prices may also have risen as buyers rushed to dealerships to avoid potential hikes, giving dealers less reason to offer discounts. Core inflation \u2014 which excludes food and energy \u2014 rose 2.8% year-on-year in April, matching March\u2019s figure. On a monthly basis, core prices increased 0.3%, up from 0.1% the month before. Also read: US to boost Saudi access to AI chips even as China issues linger"

            "text": "HomeIndia NewsHow Jalna\u2019s young changemakers are protecting children from migration\u2019s fallout In the drought-prone district of Jalna, where poverty and migration disrupt childhoods, a quiet revolution is taking place. A group of young people, known as Balmitras (friends of children), are stepping up to protect the most vulnerable. These youth volunteers, aged 18 to 29, ensure that children left behind when their parents migrate for work are not left alone, unsupported, or unsafe. Jalna, in central Marathwada, is one of the worst-affected regions in the state in terms of agrarian distress. Droughts, poor irrigation, and repeated crop failures have led to chronic poverty, pushing families\u2014especially those from Scheduled Castes and Tribes\u2014into seasonal migration. Parents move to sugarcane farms, brick kilns or construction sites in search of work, often taking their children along. These children face unsafe living conditions, disrupted schooling, and a lack of healthcare and nutrition. Some are forced into child labour or early marriage. Those who remain behind with relatives or older siblings also face emotional neglect and limited access to basic services. The Balmitras\u2019 main role is to raise awareness about the risks of unsafe migration and promote kinship care, where children stay in villages under the care of grandparents, relatives, or trusted neighbours. Through individual and group counselling with parents, they help families choose this safer alternative. The Balmitras also run after-school programmes three times a week, offering academic support, games, life skills, and psychosocial care for children of migrant workers. These sessions provide a safe and nurturing space for children to grow, learn, and express themselves. Balmitra Bhimrao Tambe, a 30-year-old youth from Jalna district, has worked in this initiative for two years. His dedication has earned him the title of Master Balmitra\u2014a mentor role in which he trains and appoints new Balmitras across villages. \u201cWhen a girl refuses child marriage and chooses to continue her education, it feels like I\u2019ve done something truly meaningful,\u201d he said with a smile. He and his fellow youth volunteers are being felicitated by the Jalna Collector for their contribution to child education and protection. Currently, Jalna district has 649 Balmitras working across six blocks. Since 2014, the percentage of children staying back in family-based care during migration seasons has steadily grown, reaching 60.23% in 258 pilot villages. In 2024\u201325 alone, over 5,800 children stayed back in kinship care. Most were cared for by grandparents, others by extended family or trusted community members. A small number lived independently with siblings in child-headed households. This community-based care model is showing outcomes such as low school dropout rates, continued access to nutrition and health services, and a reduction in child labour, early marriage, and teen pregnancies. The model has now been scaled up to 198 more villages, led by the Jalna District Collector and the State Migration Committee of the Department of Women and Child Development. Balmitras receive no monetary compensation but gain skills, confidence, and purpose. \u201cThe training they receive\u2014on child rights, communication, community mobilisation\u2014helps shape their personalities and future careers. Some of our former Balmitras have even gone on to become Sarpanch, leading their villages,\u201d said Ravi Kelgaonkar of SACRED. Bhausaheb Gunjal from Gramin Vikas Pratishthan agreed. \"Balmitras play a big role in preventing child marriage. They engage with young girls and their parents, convincing them to delay marriage and support education. We\u2019ve seen many girls who once resisted early marriage now excelling academically and winning awards in school,\u201d he added. For thousands of children in migration-affected communities, the Balmitra initiative provides a support system. It ensures continuity in education, safeguards mental health and helps children grow up in a more secure environment. It is becoming a blueprint for other districts across Maharashtra. Alpa Vora, Child Protection Specialist at UNICEF Maharashtra, said, \u201cIn Jalna, thousands of children are forced to migrate with their families due to drought and poverty. They miss school, live in unsafe conditions, and lose access to basic services. The Balmitra initiative is changing this. Trained youth volunteers now help children stay in their villages, attend school, access health services, and participate in after-school and mental wellbeing activities. This model is not just protecting children\u2014it is transforming futures.\u201d On 15 May, Jalna Collector Dr Shrikrishna Panchal will felicitate 400 Balmitras in Jalna City for their work and contribution."

The gap, which equals about 24% of the sector\u2019s total credit requirement, rose sharply to 35% for women-owned MSMEs. The report, titled 'Understanding Indian MSME Sector: Progress and Challenges,' is based on a survey of over 2,000 MSMEs across 19 sectors. It presents a detailed picture of the sector\u2019s growth, digital shift, and ongoing structural challenges. Despite formal policy support, MSMEs, especially micro units, continue to struggle with timely and adequate access to credit. The report found that 12% of micro enterprises still rely on informal borrowing, compared to just 2-3% in small and medium units. Women-led MSMEs now make up 26.2% of proprietary enterprises, according to ASUSE 2023-24. While 76% of these businesses have access to credit, 41% report that limited access and intense competition hinder their growth. Around 18% of MSMEs now use digital lending platforms, and 90% accept digital payments \u2014 highlighting a steady shift toward tech-driven finance. However, market access remains a bottleneck. About 70% of MSMEs still rely on traditional marketing, limiting scalability and competitiveness. The share of MSMEs in India\u2019s merchandise exports rose from 43.6% in FY23 to 45.7% in FY24. Export-oriented MSMEs demonstrate higher tech adoption but still face barriers like supply chain issues and credit limitations. Sustainability is also gaining ground: 31% of surveyed MSMEs use energy-efficient systems, while 21% rely on renewable energy. However, 33% cite limited awareness as the biggest barrier to further adoption. The sector has witnessed rapid formalisation through platforms like Udyam Registration and Udyam Assist. Registered MSMEs jumped from 2.5 crore in March 2024 to over 6.2 crore by March 2025. A quarter of respondents said they face skilled labour shortages \u2014 particularly in sectors like defence manufacturing, garments, hospitality, and tiles. Meanwhile, infrastructure and technology gaps continue to impact firms in auto components, iron and steel, and logistics. SIDBI\u2019s report pointed to the urgent need for targeted interventions \u2014 especially for women entrepreneurs, digitally lagging firms, and service sector MSMEs. Enhancing credit flows, improving digital outreach, and boosting sustainability awareness could help the sector unlock its full potential."

Instead, he would want to spend more time at the nets and would always choose the spiciest wicket and get bowlers to bowl at him from 16 yards \u2014 or take throw downs from 16 yards. The fact is \u2014 he always needed a challenge. That's what got him going,\" he added. Arun went down the memory lane to remember an important moment before the Boxing Day Test match of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in 2018-19 when the series was tied 1-1. \"Virat had just scored a fantastic hundred at Perth but we did not win that match,\" he said. \"Going into Melbourne, it was Virat who literally changed the dressing room mindset. He made everyone believe that we could do it and went about his business as leader in a manner unrivalled.\" India clinched an important win in that game, securing a 2-1 series win, which was a first for the country on Australian soil. Kohli brought curtains down to his career with the help of 9230 runs in 123 Tests, comprising 30 centuries, and an average of 46.85. His 40 wins as the Test captain is the most by any Indian skipper. \"He respected the format more than anything else and will be missed,\" he concluded."

            "text": "Siemens Ltd on Tuesday (May 13) reported a 27.4% year-on-year (YoY) decline in net profit at \u20b9582.5 crore for the second quarter that ended March 31, 2025, down from \u20b9803 crore in Q2FY24. The decline in profit from operations was due to under-absorption of fixed costs and higher cost of material in the digital industries business. Additionally, the profit factored in an extraordinary gain of \u20b9192 crore from the sale of property in Q2FY2024 and demerger expenses of \u20b963 crore in the current quarter. The company's revenue from operations increased 2.6% YoY to \u20b94,259 crore against \u20b94,252.4 crore. Revenue remained flat due to the ongoing normalisation of demand in digital industries and normal project delivery schedules in the mobility business, Siemens said. In Q2FY25, Siemens reported a 44% YoY increase in new orders, reaching \u20b95,305 crore. The company's order backlog also saw a 7% growth. Sunil Mathur, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Siemens, said, \"In spite of the challenging macro environment, our order income grew by 44% driven by our mobility and smart infrastructure businesses, where we see continued public capex spending on infrastructure.\u201d The results came after the close of the market hours. Shares of Siemens Ltd ended at \u20b92,917.25, up by \u20b920.35, or 0.70%, on the BSE."

            "title": "Acer Aspire C27 Review: A budget-friendly all-in-one PC",
            "text": "The Acer Aspire C27 makes a compelling case as a value-driven alternative to premium all-in-one (AIO) desktops, offering solid performance and a space-saving design for users on tighter budgets. Starting at around \u20b960,990, it lands between two extremes: The pricey Apple iMac 27-inch, with its class-leading Retina display, and more limited options like HP\u2019s compact Chromebase. At a glance, the Aspire C27 could pass for a standard monitor. Its slim profile, minimalist bezels, and V-shaped stand help it blend unobtrusively into a workspace. But under the surface, it\u2019s a complete Windows 11-based desktop PC \u2014 the review unit was powered by 12th-Gen Intel Core i5-12450H, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and a 1TB SSD. There are other configurations depending on users' needs. From a hardware standpoint, the Aspire C27 covers many essentials. The internals are well suited for everyday productivity \u2014 think spreadsheets, web browsing, video calls, and even a bit of photo editing. The system runs quietly thanks to efficient mobile-grade components and rarely draws attention to itself with fan noise. It\u2019s well-optimised for typical home or office tasks, delivering smooth performance for general Windows workloads. In terms of build, the Aspire C27 is compact. The design hides all the components behind the lower half of the screen, while downward-firing speakers bounce audio off the desk surface. The sound is surprisingly loud and clear, though it lacks the low-end presence that a front-facing speaker bar or subwoofer might provide. The 27-inch full HD (1920x1080) display is perhaps the Aspire C27\u2019s weakest link. On paper, it offers a generous screen size with a 90.71% screen-to-body ratio, but the resolution doesn\u2019t quite match the panel\u2019s real estate. Text and icons look soft, and individual pixels are noticeable from a normal viewing distance \u2014 a problem more common on smaller, lower-resolution screens. The brightness, measured at just 216 nits, is adequate for indoor use but well below the 300-nit baseline many users would expect. The Aspire C27 features a 5MP 'Super HD' webcam in some models \u2014 a welcome improvement over the standard 720p unit found in other configurations. It\u2019s supported by Acer PurifiedView, which helps improve clarity during video calls. This marks a step up from the grainy, underexposed images seen on many entry-level AIOs. Acer bundles a wireless keyboard and mouse, which is a welcome touch at this price point. The keyboard is functional and comfortable, while the compact mouse gets the job done \u2014 though many users may want to upgrade to a full-size option for daily use. The Aspire C27 isn\u2019t built for gaming or heavy media production, but it handles day-to-day computing with ease. Benchmarks place it solidly in the mid-range for Windows AIOs, trailing premium options like the iMac but keeping pace with other budget and mid-tier rivals. It can even manage light video or photo editing, though its integrated graphics (or modest MX330 GPU, if equipped) rule out anything beyond casual gaming. The Acer Aspire C27 is a practical, no-nonsense all-in-one that delivers where it matters most: Solid performance, sleek design, and a price tag that makes it an attractive iMac alternative. It\u2019s well suited to students, professionals working from home, or anyone looking for a clean, clutter-free setup without breaking the bank. Its biggest flaws \u2014 namely the low-resolution display and lack of USB-C \u2014 don\u2019t ruin the experience, but they do put it a step behind more premium rivals. If Acer offered a higher-resolution panel option, the C27 could easily stand out as a top pick in the mid-range AIO segment."

            "text": "Amid border tensions between India and Pakistan, Spotify and YouTube Music have removed the pictures of Fawad Khan, Mawra Hocane and Mahira Khan from the posters of Bollywood films. Fawad Khan, who played the role of Rahul Kapoor in Kapoor & Sons, has been edited out of the film's poster on Spotify. The updated poster now only features Siddharth Kapoor and Alia Bhatt. Similarly, Mahira, who played the lead role opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Raees , has also been removed from the film's poster on music streaming platforms. The original poster, which featured both the lead actors, now only shows Shah Rukh Khan. Spotify and YouTube Music have also removed the image of Mawra from the Sanam Teri Kasam album cover. It now only shows Harshvardhan Rane. There were rumours that its sequel would be made with the original cast. With the rising tensions between the two neighbouring countries, Shraddha Kapoor reportedly replaced Mawra in Sanam Teri Kasam 2. Hania Aamir, who was earlier announced as part of the cast of Sardaarji 3 alongside Diljit Dosanjh, has been dropped from the project. According to The Statesman, the makers are considering removing her scenes and reshooting them with another actress. The decision to drop Pakistani actors from projects and edit them out of previous films came in the wake of their criticism of India's Operation Sindoor. Soon after the terror attack, India blocked several popular Pakistani actors' and content creators' Instagram accounts."

            "text": "HomeTechnology NewsCMF Phone 2 Pro Review: A budget beauty that gets the basics right CMF, the budget-focused sub-brand from Nothing, made its debut last year with the CMF Phone 1 \u2014 a device that won over value-conscious buyers. It wasn\u2019t without its faults, though: No charger in the box, no protective case, and a middling camera setup left a few boxes unticked. Now, CMF returns with the Phone 2 Pro \u2014 a device that promises a more polished experience, better specs, and even modular accessories to boot. Priced at \u20b918,999, it sits in one of the most competitive segments of the smartphone market. The CMF Phone 2 Pro keeps the modular spirit of its predecessor alive, but this time, it\u2019s more refined. It\u2019s the thinnest phone CMF has produced to date, measuring just 7.8mm and weighing 185g \u2014 comfortably slim and light in the hand. The back panel is no longer removable, but the phone retains its signature screw-in wheel for attaching accessories, now redesigned to sit flush with the frame. A 120Hz adaptive refresh rate ensures smooth scrolling, and the 1,000Hz touch sampling rate makes the phone feel especially snappy during games or fast-paced navigation. CMF has opted for Panda Glass over Gorilla Glass, which is slightly less-known but should still offer decent protection. Powering the CMF Phone 2 Pro is MediaTek\u2019s Dimensity 7300 Pro chipset, paired with 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage. There\u2019s also the option to add 8GB of virtual RAM for a smoother multitasking experience. It\u2019s not the fastest chip in its class, but in everyday use, the Phone 2 Pro is more than capable. Apps open quickly, switching between tasks is smooth, and light gaming is handled well. CMF has promised three years of major Android updates and six years of security patches, which is generous for a phone at this price. The minimalist aesthetic of Nothing OS complements the hardware nicely, with smooth animations and a focus on usability over flash. The CMF Phone 2 Pro isn\u2019t trying to be the flashiest or the fastest phone under \u20b920,000 \u2014 and that\u2019s precisely what makes it so appealing. It focuses on getting the fundamentals right: Good design, decent performance, a great display, and a surprisingly versatile camera setup. Throw in a clean software experience and modular accessories that actually add value, and you\u2019ve got a device that feels more considered than many of its peers. If you\u2019re after a stylish, reliable handset that dares to do things a bit differently, the CMF Phone 2 Pro is easy to recommend."

            "text": "HomeSports NewsHere's why Greg Chappell calls Virat Kohli the most Australian non-Australian cricketer ever Australian legend Greg Chappell understands that Virat Kohli's Test retirement is the end of a thunderous era where he eclipsed Sachin Tendulkar and carved a cultural and psychological impact in Indian cricket. Chappell wrote in his ESPNCricinfo article that Kohli's long career was a reign defined by grit, fire, and audacity. \"It closes the chapter on the most transformative figure in Indian cricket since Sachin Tendulkar; perhaps Kohli even eclipses him in terms of cultural influence and psychological impact on India's cricketing identity,\" Chappell wrote. \"Kohli, the incandescent heart of Indian cricket for over a decade, did not just score runs. He redefined expectations, challenged conventions, and symbolised the self-assured, unapologetic India of the 21st century,\" he added. Kohli hung his boots from the red-ball format and explained that he was walking away from the format with a heart full of gratitude. \"Virat Kohli is the most Australian non-Australian cricketer we've ever seen,\" Chappell wrote. \"He was - a snarling warrior in whites, never giving an inch, always demanding more. Not just of his bowlers, his fielders or his opposition, but first and foremost, of himself,\" he said. Chappell further added that Kohli exiting Test matches was a seismic shift in energy. \"There was a time when Indian cricket, particularly overseas, bore an air of respectful submission - playing with technical skill, yes, but often with psychological inferiority. \"That changed in stages. Sourav Ganguly gave Indian cricket a new spine. MS Dhoni brought ice-cold leadership and white-ball dominance. But Kohli? Kohli lit the fire. He tore the script and authored a new one, where India was not just competitive abroad but expected to win,\" he explained. The former Indian head coach applauded the batter for transforming India's approach in Test cricket, and described Kohli as an exceptionally perceptive individual. \"Where others reacted, Kohli anticipated. He saw innings before they unfolded. He lived the pressure before it arrived. \"Yes, Tendulkar was a genius. Yes, Dhoni was a master tactician and an ice-cold finisher. But in the grand reckoning of Indian cricket history, Kohli has been its most influential figure,\" he said. \"Why? Because he changed not just results but mindsets.\""

The growth was most pronounced in the premium segment, which expanded 41% compared to the same period last year. 5G-enabled tablets now account for 43% of total shipments, a clear sign that Indian consumers are increasingly opting for future-ready devices. Samsung maintained its lead with a 34% market share, followed by Apple at 21% and Lenovo at 19%. Xiaomi followed closely with a 16% share, riding high on the performance of its Xiaomi Pad 7, which contributed 36% of premium tablet sales in the quarter. Source: CyberMedia Research \u201cIndian consumers are increasingly aspirational, driving demand for the latest and most advanced devices to support work, learning, and entertainment,\u201d said Prabhu Ram, VP, Industry Research Group, CMR. Ram said the iPad\u2019s success is propelled by Apple\u2019s strong brand equity and the seamless integration of its ecosystem, which he said remains a key differentiator valued by users seeking a unified experience across devices. \"On the Android front, Samsung stands out as the only brand consistently delivering a competitive premium experience, with features such as vibrant displays, robust security, productivity modes, and long-term software support. Beyond Samsung, most Android tablet users prioritise value-for-money offerings, with brands like Xiaomi gaining significant traction.\u201d Apple recorded 18% YoY growth, driven by strong shipments of the iPad 11 Series, which made up 49% of its total volumes.

Xiaomi, meanwhile, saw a substantial YoY growth of 59%, boosted by its continued appeal in the value-premium segment. \u201cBrands like Samsung, Apple, Lenovo and Xiaomi capitalised on evolving consumer expectations with differentiated offerings across price tiers,\u201d said Menka Kumari, senior analyst at CMR, adding, \u201cThe tablet market is gaining momentum in the premium segment, driven by aspirational consumers seeking high performance and ecosystem value.\u201d Looking ahead, CMR expects the Indian tablet market to grow at a steady 10\u201315% through the rest of the calendar year. The research firm sees increasing demand around the academic admissions season, as well as during upcoming festive promotions. AI-powered features, improved cameras and deeper ecosystem integration are also likely to influence purchase decisions.

US President Donald Trump is preparing to accept a Boeing 747-8 aeroplane as a gift from the Qatari royal family. Dubbed 'palace in the sky', the luxury plane costs approximately $400 million and will replace Air Force One. The President will use the 13-year-old plane until shortly before the end of his second term in office, when it will be transferred to his presidential library. (Image X) According to a report in Axios, the US and Qatar were negotiating the price of the giant aircraft, when Qatar came back and said, \u201cWe'll just gift it. It's OK.\u201d \u201cAnd it's gifted to the people of the United States, gifted to the Department of Defense. And it's supposed to be ready by the end of the year,\u201d a top administration source added. (Image: Reuters) Speaking with reporters on Monday, Trump said, \u201cI think it's a great gesture from Qatar.\u201d \u201cI appreciate it very much. I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. I mean, I could be a stupid person saying: 'No, we don't want a free, very expensive aeroplane,\" he added as reported by Sky News. (Image X) As per reports, it is the same jet the US leader toured at Palm Beach International Airport earlier this year. Earlier on Sunday, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform that the aircraft is free to temporarily replace Air Force One. (Image Reuters) \u201cSo, the fact that the Defense Department is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40-year- old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane,\u201d he wrote. (Image YouTube) The aircraft features a master bedroom, a guest bedroom, two full bathrooms with showers, nine smaller restrooms, five small kitchens and a private office. (Image X) The soon-to-be Air Force has the capacity to hold about 90 passengers and 14 crew members, as per the Daily Mail. (Image X) The plane has been equipped with giant couches and recliners, wood panelling, and over 40 televisions, including ten large-screen TVs. The private Boeing 747 was originally used by a division of Qatar Airways that serves the country's royal families and other government dignitaries. (Image X) It has been modified to fit five distinct lounges throughout the aircraft's two major decks, connected by a luxurious staircase. The massive plane has only five rows of standard business class seating. The plane also includes all of the latest air travel amenities, such as live TV and radio access, 13 Blu-ray players and internet connectivity. (Image Wikipedia) As per the Business Jet Traveller, it is considered one of the most lavish in the world. The inside of the plane, designed by renowned French interior design firm Alberto Pinto Cabinet, features elaborate suites, staterooms, lounges and dining areas.

            "text": "HomeBusiness NewsRetail NewsONDC appoints Vibhor Jain as acting CEO amid leadership transition The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) has named Chief Operating Officer Vibhor Jain its acting CEO with immediate effect, as the organisation moves to a single-point leadership structure during its search for a permanent Managing Director and CEO. Jain, who is also a member of ONDC\u2019s eight-member Executive Committee, will now assume full executive responsibilities. The transition brings an end to the interim leadership role played by the committee over the past few weeks, ONDC said in a press release. \u201cThe Executive Committee has done a commendable job of guiding ONDC during a critical phase of its journey. However, with several key strategic decisions underway, it is imperative to have a single point of leadership to drive cohesive execution,\u201d said Suresh Sethi, ONDC Board Member. \u201cVibhor has played a pivotal role in shaping ONDC\u2019s operational framework, and the Board has full confidence in his ability to lead the organisation during this important transition.\u201d Jaxay Shah, also a member of the Board, added, \u201cAs Vibhor steps into the role of Acting CEO, the Board is confident in his ability to lead with clarity and purpose. His deep experience and unwavering commitment to ONDC\u2019s mission make him well-suited to guide the organisation forward as we continue to build an inclusive and open digital commerce ecosystem. We also acknowledge the Executive Committee for helping ensure continuity during the recent transition period.\u201d In his first comments as Acting CEO, Jain said, \u201cIt is an honour to take on this responsibility at a time when ONDC is expanding its footprint and impact across the country. I am committed to working closely with the Board, stakeholders, and the broader ecosystem to ensure continuity and momentum as we deliver on our mission to democratise digital commerce in India.\u201d ONDC has crossed several milestones since its launch, including more than 200 million transactions in under three years. The network is part of India\u2019s broader push to create foundational digital public infrastructure and is seen as a key initiative in transforming the digital commerce landscape through greater accessibility and inclusivity."

The agreement would boost Saudi Arabia\u2019s ability to buy chips from the likes of Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which are considered the gold standard for training and running artificial intelligence models, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential conversations. President Donald Trump is in Riyadh Tuesday, kicking off a broader Middle East trip, and he could announce the deal as soon as this week. But while the two governments have reached an early-stage accord, they are still hashing out a number of key details, the people said. Front and center are US concerns that China could access chips sent to Saudi Arabia, either through the diversion of physical shipments or by tapping the capabilities of those chips via the cloud. One provision under discussion, the people said, would see the US government control access to data centers that use American chips. It\u2019s not clear under what conditions, or to whom, access would be granted.

The deal is one of two major AI chip accords that Trump officials are negotiating as they prepare to rewrite US rules governing the export of advanced chips worldwide. Trump may announce the second agreement with the United Arab Emirates later in his trip, Bloomberg has reported. Taken together, the deals indicate that Trump is much more willing than President Joe Biden to see advanced American technology shipped to the Gulf \u2014 a region where he also has major business interests and where sovereign wealth funds have pledged substantial investments in the US."

Pradeep Kheruka, Executive Chairman at Borosil Renewables said, \u201cWe have been selling in the past at a very low price, trying to match the dumped prices coming from China, which was selling well below the actual cost of production, even for them. The other thing is also a growth in volume. We have achieved a growth in volume as well as a growth in prices.\u201d Borosil Renewables posted a turnaround in January-March quarter 2025 (Q4FY25) results, with EBITDA rising to \u20b915.5 crore, a reversal from losses seen in the same period last year. It reported a revenue of \u20b9373 crore and loss of \u20b920 crore. As of now, domestic prices are stabilising at around \u20b954,000 per tonne. While the domestic market has improved, Borosil's European subsidiary remains under pressure, posting monthly losses of \u20ac800,000 to \u20ac900,000. The segment was hit hard by a flood of low-cost Chinese solar modules in 2024, which led to a shutdown of several EU-based manufacturers. \u201cBut hopefully from July, we should see a downturn in that. If we start production of tempered glass there based on imported glass, then that should reduce the loss by more than half. The moment we have a little more firm news about resumption of production, then that will cause, hopefully, the loss to go away and maybe even some profits to be seen,\u201d Kheruka added. Borosil Renewables has secured board approval to increase its production capacity by 500 tonnes per day. While there is potential to scale up beyond this level based on available equipment, the company is currently limiting its guidance to the approved 500 tonnes, in line with what has been formally communicated to the stock exchanges. Borosil Renewables\u2019s current market capitalisation is \u20b96,885 crore. The stock is currently trading at \u20b9526 as of 3:30 pm on the NSE and has gained 6% over the last year.

If you fail to submit a redemption request today, you cannot redeem prematurely until the next eligible redemption date. This opportunity typically arises every six months, on the next interest payout date. You will continue holding the bonds until the next redemption window opens. Experts advise checking with your bank or depository participant well in advance of such dates. For demat account holders, a redemption request can be submitted through the depository participant. It must be noted that the government in Union Budget 2025 discontinued fresh issuances of the Sovereign Gold Bond scheme.

The BCCI decided on Monday to resume the IPL season across six venues from May 17, with the final slated for June 3. The development leaves Australia's and South Africa\u2019s Test regulars in a dilemma, as the WTC final between the two nations is slated to begin on June 11 at Lord\u2019s. \"Following the announcement that the IPL will resume on Saturday, Cricket Australia will support players in their individual decisions whether to return to India or not,\u201d CA said in a statement. \"Team management will work through the preparation implications for the World Test Championship final for those players who choose to play in the remaining IPL matches. \"We are maintaining communication with the Australian government and BCCI around security arrangements and safety.\" The IPL was suspended last Friday due to a military conflict between India and Pakistan. According to the revised schedule, the tournament would end just eight days before the WTC final in London where Australia face South Africa. In the wake of the unrest, several Australian players, including skipper Pat Cummins and fast bowler Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood have returned home. Only a few former players like Ricky Ponting and Brad Haddin, who are part of coaching setups, remain in India. Other coaches, including Justin Langer and Mike Hussey, have returned home amid the rising border tensions. Australian Test players currently involved in the IPL who are likely to be impacted include captain Cummins and Travis Head (both Sunrisers Hyderabad), Starc (Delhi Capitals), and Hazlewood (Royal Challengers Bengaluru).

The retailer, whose 1,000 stores remain open, is widely reported to have been the victim of a ransomware attack, where criminals infiltrate companies' computer systems, encrypt them and demand payment before allowing them to resume control. M&S said some customer details had been taken, blaming the \"sophisticated nature\" of the incident, and said it would inform customers of the issue. \"Importantly, the data does not include useable payment or card details, which we do not hold on our systems, and it does not include any account passwords,\" M&S said in its statement. \"There is no evidence that this data has been shared.\" Advising customers there was no need to take any action, the company said work was continuing to get operations back to normal. It said it had taken steps to protect is systems, while working with cybersecurity experts, law enforcement and government agencies.

These changes reflect the banks' responses to evolving economic conditions and the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy decisions. Bank of Baroda reduced its one-year MCLR by 5 basis points, bringing it down from 9.00% to 8.95%, effective May 12, 2025. Other tenures, including overnight, one-month, three-month, and six-month MCLRs, remain unchanged. The overnight rate stands at 8.15%, while the six-month rate remains at 8.80%. The one-year MCLR is the most commonly used benchmark for home and auto loans, and the reduction is likely to offer slight EMI relief to borrowers. Canara Bank reduced its MCLR selectively, with a 5 basis point cut in the overnight tenor, now at 8.30%. The two-year MCLR was also lowered by 10 basis points to 9.25%. However, other tenures were left unchanged. Punjab National Bank announced a broader reduction in lending rates across all tenures, also effective from May.

            "text": "Chalet Hotels is confident of delivering double-digit revenue growth in 2025\u201326 (FY26), supported by strong demand across both its hospitality and annuity businesses. \u201cWe\u2019ve still grown at 12% over the May of last year,\u201d said Sethi, referring to a few cancellations in leisure bookings due to geopolitical uncertainty. The company expects growth from both existing hotels and new assets that are being added to its portfolio. It aims to cross 5,000 operational and pipeline rooms over the next four to five quarters. Chalet Hotels reported a good set of fourth-quarter numbers, slightly better than the industry. Revenue and margins were strong, and average room rates increased by 21%. These are the edited excerpts of the interview. Q: Good end to Q4 and to the financial year. What are you targeting for this year when it comes to revenue? And could you break that down for us in terms of increased occupancy, rates, and also annuity revenue, which is margin accretive? A: We've had a very strong Q4. It\u2019s been record-breaking on all parameters and it\u2019s in line with what we've been saying, that the industry continues to have tailwinds for the foreseeable future. On the macro front, the next three to four years will be very strong, where demand will outpace supply. So, we\u2019ll see some small occupancy improvements in stabilised hotels, but more importantly, we should see rate improvements going forward. The current situation over the last couple of weeks had us concerned. We took contingency steps to freeze costs and closely monitor the situation. Looking ahead, I\u2019m hopeful June business will be back in full swing. In May, we've lost some business but we\u2019ve still grown 12% over May of last year. So growth is still on track. We believe we will see double-digit growth from existing hotels, and as we add new ones, inorganic growth will also kick in. The office assets are moving into provisioning and leasing very quickly. We had an exit rate of \u20b921 crore in March, and this month we\u2019ll probably hit \u20b925 crore, which means \u20b9300 crore in annual rentals, with about 95% flow-through. Hospitality continues to be our largest segment across both leisure and business hotels. Q: What about the cancellations you saw in May and the impact. What was the percentage of cancellations and any specific impact on your northern properties? A: The leisure hotels saw cancellations for MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) movement due to uncertainty last week. We hope many of those will return, as they\u2019ve pushed dates rather than cancelled outright. Subject to availability, they could help us recoup some lost business. As of May 12, we\u2019re still 12% over the same period last year. We\u2019re currently about 6-9% shy of our internal targets, but this isn\u2019t a massive hit by any means. Q: From a growth standpoint, you\u2019ve earlier said FY26 will see several assets come on stream and FY27 is where growth really shows. You have around 3,300 keys now and 1,250 under development. That\u2019s around 30% capacity push. Your annuity assets should also grow by 10-20%. If FY25 revenue ended near \u20b91,700 crore and FY26 gets you to \u20b92,000 crore, are we looking at \u20b92,500 crore in FY27 with 40%+ margins? A: We don\u2019t give forward-looking numbers, but I\u2019d say your numbers aren\u2019t far off. We have our internal assessment and believe we\u2019ll do better than that. So yes, \u20b92,500 crore is achievable by FY27. On margins, we\u2019ve delivered 46-47%, so not just 40% but well above that. As office assets mature, margins will also improve. Q: On the balance sheet, you deleveraged a bit via QIP and later acquired Western Himalayas, which added about \u20b9500 crore in debt. Where does net debt stand now, and what's the deleveraging plan? A: Net debt is just under \u20b92,000 crore. We\u2019ve taken enabling resolutions to raise \u20b91,000 crore in future if needed just to keep dry powder ready for growth opportunities. Most of the announced pipeline will be funded by internal cash flows. But we want to be ready to act on new opportunities. Our goal is to cross 5,000 rooms across operational and pipeline hotels over the next 4-5 quarters. Q: You have two new properties, Western Hyderabad and the Khandala retreat. When will they reflect fully in your P&L? A: The Westin Hyderabad, part of the Western Himalayas acquisition, has been operational since around February 10-12. So, it was reflected for about 40+ days in FY25. It\u2019s still ramping up. Current occupancies are around 43-45%, with ARRs at \u20b927,000\u2013\u20b928,000. We expect it to stabilise at about 60% occupancy. At our Dukes Retreat in Khandala, 73 rooms are operational. A banquet facility will be ready by the end of this month. Once we expand to 145 rooms, we expect this property to contribute meaningfully starting October this year."

Konstas was sent home from the tour of Sri Lanka after failing to make the squad and was playing for New South Wales. He made an exciting debut against India in the fourth Test in Melbourne but could not continue the momentum subsequently. Green was laid low by a back injury that needed surgery last year. Spinner Matt Kuhnemann has been included as the backup for regular Nathan Lyon, while Brendan Doggett has been named as a travelling reserve. The same squad will then head to the West Indies for a three-Test series in Barbados, Grenada and Jamaica from June 25. Cummins and Josh Hazlewood, both of who sat out of the Test series against Sri Lanka and the subsequent Champions Trophy due to injuries, are back in the squad after successfully returning to action during the Indian Premier League. Mitchell Starc, and Scott Boland make up the rest of the pace attack. South Australia's Doggett will be the back-up pacer in case of an injury breakdown. The right-arm pacer began well in his ongoing county stint with Durham, claiming nine wickets in his first two matches. Australia squad for WTC final: Pat Cummins (c), Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Cameron Green, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Matt Kuhnemann, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Beau Webster.

            "text": "HomeMarket NewsLupin's new drug launch could contribute over 25% of its FY26 earnings, analyst says Shares of Lupin Ltd shares gained nearly 4% on Tuesday, May 13, as the pharma company launched the Tolvaptan tablets or Jynarque generic in the US market. Axis Capital said Lupin is expected to be the only generic player for the most of the financial year 2026. The company's revenue opportunity for the ongoing fiscal is estimated at $150 million to $200 million. The gTolvaptan drug can contribute over 25% to Lupin's FY26 earnings and can be a major driver for its performance in this fiscal, Axis Capital said. The launch helps offset revenue loss from gMirabegron in FY26, the analyst added. Factoring all this, Axis Cap said it has revised its FY26 earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortisation (EBOITDA) and profit after tax (PAT) by 8% and 10%, respectively. Lupin is the first to file for this product and is eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity. The drug is indicated to slow kidney function decline in adults at risk of rapidly progressing autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. It has a market size of $1.46 billion. The product will be manufactured at Lupin's Nagpur facility in India. Last month, Lupin received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for its new drug application Tolvaptan in the 15 mg, 30 mg, 45 mg, 60 mg and 90 mg strengths. Lupin shares gained 3.56% to hit an intraday high of \u20b92,114.3 apiece on Tuesday, May 13. The stock has declined 12.77% this year, so far.

Revenue rose 4.4% to \u20b99,939 crore, which was higher than CNBC-TV18's poll of \u20b99,705 crore. The same was \u20b99,519 crore in the year-ago quarter.

The company reported an EBITDA of \u20b91,359 crore in the same quarter a year ago. EBITDA margin for the period stood at 14.26% as against last year's 14.30%. Margin was driven by a favourable product mix, enhanced cost efficiencies and commodity costs. The company has recommended a final dividend of \u20b965 per share of face value of \u20b92 each. Record date for the said dividend has been fixed as July 24, 2025. This will be subject to approval of the members of the company at the ensuing 42nd annual general meeting (AGM). The payment of the dividend will be completed within 30 days of declaration at the ensuing 42nd AGM. \"We achieved highest\u2010ever revenue and profit in the year, reinforcing our position as the market leader for the 24th consecutive year, closing both CY24 and FY25 at the top,\" said Vikram S Kasbekar, Executive Director & Acting Chief Executive Officer. \"Continued consolidation in the core segment, growth in the 125cc category, and the upcoming EV launch position us well for sustained momentum,\" Kasbekar added. CFO Vivek Anand said the company remains optimistic about the near\u2010to\u2010mid\u2010term outlook ahead. Key macroeconomic indicators, including revised income tax slabs, repo rate cuts, a strengthening rural economy, and a favorable monsoon forecast, are expected to support industry growth.

Among concrete steps, Washington said late Monday it would slash the levies imposed on so-called \u2018de minimis\u2019 shipments - low value packages that used to be duty free. The U.S. had hiked tariffs on the parcels to 120%, but will now bring them back down to 54%. That\u2019s likely to be a boost for online giants like Temu and Shein, which have built their rapid growth on the de minimis provision. However, a minimum flat fee of $100 will remain in place. In a further move, China has removed a ban on airlines taking delivery of Boeing jets. That\u2019s according to Bloomberg News, which says the move follows the trade agreement. There was no comment on the report from Boeing or Beijing. Excitement over the trade deal initially lifted global stocks on Tuesday, but some of the optimism later waned, with equities in Shanghai closing broadly flat. Economists pointed out that the agreement still leaves average tariffs significantly higher than they were before the turmoil began.

She said, \"President Trump clearly called out the huge price differential between developed markets, especially Europe and the US, and he asked why companies are adopting a dual price strategy when it comes to the US, where US is almost paying, in some cases 50 or 80% higher than European countries. So I think that's his first target, where he wants to basically reduce this big disparity that he sees.\u201d President Trump signed an executive order directing drugmakers to lower prices in the US to match the prices other countries pay. The order gives drug companies 30 days to implement the changes. Mazumdar-Shaw also noted that Trump addressed the role of middlemen, such as Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) and wholesalers, in keeping drug prices high. Trump believes these middlemen are part of the reason patients face high drug costs. The approach, according to Shaw, is focused on drug pricing rather than tariffs. She also mentioned that generics and biosimilars are clearly part of the Affordable Care Act, but they are not the target of Trump's current efforts. Read Here | Analysts assess the impact of Trump's drug pricing order on Indian pharma Mazumdar-Shaw explained that President Trump's focus is primarily on reducing the cost of high-value drugs. \" If you know how the market is split, 80% of prescription drugs by volume only account for 20% of the value and it's 20% of prescription drugs by volume, account for 80% of value and that's the 80% he wants to shrink.\u201d When asked about the potential increase in prices of patented drugs imported or licensed from branded pharma in India, Mazumdar-Shaw explained that President Trump does not plan to raise prices in developing countries. He believes that drug companies already set lower prices for these regions, as they require more affordable options. In contrast, Trump has stated that Europe does not need lower prices, which is why his focus is not on reducing prices there."

Andrew Tilton, Chief Asia Pacific Economist at Goldman Sachs, said the 90-day agreement between the US and China to roll back tariffs was \u201cbetter than expected\u201d and has already started to shift global sentiment. \u201cOur US economics team has upgraded their growth forecast from 0.5% over the next four quarters to 1% and lowered their probability of recession in the US from 45% to 35%,\u201d Tilton said. Tilton also noted that the medium-term to long-term growth forecast for India remains unchanged While short-term challenges may affect the economy temporarily, Tilton believes the long-term picture hasn\u2019t changed. Over the past couple of years, India has seen tighter government policies\u2014such as reduced fiscal deficits, steady interest rates, and stricter credit regulations. But that phase seems to be shifting. With interest rates now starting to come down, policy is becoming more neutral or even supportive of growth. As a result, Goldman Sachs expects India\u2019s economic activity to strengthen through the second half of 2025 and into 2026. Tilton believes ex-China, the tariff picture for the rest of Asia doesn't appear to have changed too much. On the margin, the news is a bit more positive from a growth and markets perspective, but no new news, really, for the rest of Asia.

This ensures fewer errors and faster processing. Form 16 is divided into two parts. Part A includes the employer and employee details, PANs, TAN, and a summary of TDS. Part B has the salary breakup, exempt allowances, and deductions under the Income Tax Act. If an employee switches jobs during the year, each employer issues a separate Part A. In case of loss, employees can ask their employer for a duplicate Form 16. Typically, taxpayers must file ITR by July 31, unless the government extends the deadline. Filing helps claim refunds on excess taxes paid or deducted. The Income Tax Department has released ITR-1 to ITR-7, along with the ITR-V (verification) and ITR acknowledgement forms, enabling early filers to get started. Still, for salaried individuals, the actual filing may begin only after Form 16 becomes available in June."

            "text": "HomeLegal NewsJustice Khanna retires as CJI, tenure marked with actions on Waqf Act, cash at Justice Varma's residence I met Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sanjiv Khanna over a cup of tea, just a few days before his retirement. As a curious journalist, I inquired about the investigation into cash at Justice Yashwant Varma's residence \u2013 his reply was curt but pointed. He said \u2013 if there any news coming from the Supreme Court, you can be rest assured that it\u2019s not from me. These are the words that symbolise his tenure at helm of the Indian judiciary. Justice Sanjay Khanna retires as India\u2019s 51st Chief Justice. Having taken on the reigns in November 2024, he\u2019s had a brief tenure of just a little over six months. For someone who followed the media blitz of former CJI Justice Chandrachud, Justice Khanna\u2019s tenure was unusually quiet. But quiet did not mean without tension. Read more: India Pakistan News Live Updates: Three Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists killed in gunfight in South Kashmir The biggest issue during his tenure was a situation almost out of a 90s Bollywood production. On the night of March 14, fire broke out at the residence of Delhi HC judge Justice Yashwant Varma. On reaching the location, fire marshals discovered gunny bags full of half burnt cash. An unprecedent crisis, social media fury, and public confidence at an all-time low in the judiciary. To restore lost faith, CJI Khanna followed the mantra - sunlight is the best disinfectant. On March 22, in a first of its kind move, CJI Khanna published all the details on the supreme court website. The website now had pictures and videos of the cash, report by the Delhi police and even reports by the Delhi HC Chief Justice recommending a probe. Subsequently, CJI Khanna appointed a three-judge inquiry committee, which submitted its report within 45 days, on May 5. And by May 8, Justice Khanna had already dispatched the report and Justice Varma\u2019s response to the President and the Prime Minister. Here\u2019s what interesting, as per the SC\u2019s In-House Procedure, the CJI is required to refer the matter to the President and PM, ONLY if \u2013 the inquiry committee has found \u201csubstance\u201d in allegations, has recommended his removal and the judge has refused to resign. CJI Khanna may have paved the way for a rare impeachment proceedings. Another key feature of his tenure will be the judges disclosing assets to public. In a first, on May 6, 21 out of 33 judges disclosed assets and investments on the supreme court website. That figure has now risen to 24. This was seen as another step by CJI Khanna to restore confidence after the Justice Yashwant Varma episode. What makes this unique, is that similar resolution for sharing asset details were floated in 1997 and 2009. But most judges chose to avoid any disclosure or scrutiny. Read more: CJI Khanna stresses on crisper petitions, says huge effort needed to master 'art of drafting' On the judicial side, CJI Khanna left his mark on the Waqf case. In a power move, Centre passed the Waqf Act with much fanfare. CJI Khanna however stood in the way. He questioned non-Muslims in Waqf Boards and Central Council. He also questioned the government on change of status of existing waqf properties. Justice Khanna had proposed a stay of the new act. Alarmed, the Centre undertook that under new act no new appointments will be made and status of waqf properties shall not be changed. Justice Khanna also brought an end, at least for now, to the politics of mandir-masjid. A spurt of cases and trial court orders directing survey of mosques or dargahs, for remnants of temples, had led to religious tensions and violence. On December 12, Justice Khanna passed orders barring any fresh suits for religious sites, and stayed trial courts from passing orders directing surveys. Even before he became CJI, he left his imprint on several key cases. He\u2019s ruled that CJIs were subject to RTI. In a landmark case, he was a part of the 5-judge bench that abrogated article 370. Last year, he was part of another landmark 5-judge bench that struck down electoral bonds as illegal. Interestingly, he also granted bail to Kejriwal in an ED case to let him campaign during Lok Sabha elections of 2024. Justice Khanna has tried to play it by the book as a judge and as an administrator. But with cases like challenges to UAPA, PMLA and CAA still pending, some are asking if despite his brief stint, he could have done more."

Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Rajneesh Karnatak said the bank has set a target of \u20b911,000 crore in gross cash recoveries for the year, up from \u20b99,500 crore in FY25. \u201cThe slippage ratio has come down to 1.36% from 1.53% in FY24. Our internal target for gross cash recovery is around \u20b911,000 crore, which will help improve both operating and net profit in FY26,\u201d Karnatak said in an interview with CNBC-TV18. However, the bank expects some pressure on margins in the near term, following recent repo rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India. The full transmission of lower deposit rates may take a few quarters, with margin stabilisation likely only in the second half of the year. Despite this, the bank remains optimistic about sustaining credit costs and maintaining healthy capital and CASA levels. These are the edited excerpts of the interview. Q: We know that Q4 was mainly driven by recoveries. What is the recovery pipeline looking like for FY26? What should we be expecting on that front? A: We have done a gross cash recovery of nearly \u20b99,500 crore this year against gross cash recoveries of around \u20b97,800 crore in FY24. We have been able to contain our fresh slippages also. Our slippage ratio has come down to 1.36% as against 1.53% in FY24. For this year also, our internal management target for gross cash recovery is around \u20b911,000 crore, which will help us improve our operating profit and net profit in FY26."

In an email sent to Prime members on Tuesday, the company announced that its movies and TV shows will begin including \u201climited advertisements\u201d, while maintaining that the number of ads will be \u201cmeaningfully fewer\u201d than those on traditional TV or other streaming services. The company first announced these impending changes in October 2024 in a blog post that it will include limited advertisements in India, and that the price of the ad-free option would be shared at a later date \u201cTo continue investing in compelling content and keep increasing that investment over a long period of time, starting in 2025, Prime Video shows and movies will include limited advertisements in India. We aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers,\u201d the company had stated in the post. The move also mirrors Amazon\u2019s global strategy, with Prime Video rolling out ads in international markets, including the US, where the ad-supported version of the platform already reaches over 130 million users monthly, according to the company\u2019s latest disclosure on May 12. This marks a 15 million increase in average monthly reach from 2024. For Indian consumers who prefer an uninterrupted viewing experience, Amazon will offer an ad-free add-on at a discounted launch price of \u20b9699 per year or \u20b9129 per month. Originally marked at \u20b9999 per year, this add-on will be available to purchase from the same date ads go live, June 17. The company added that this change will not have any impact on Prime Lite subscribers, who have access to Prime Video\u2019s full library of content, on any single device (TV or mobile) in 720p high-definition with ads. Additionally, there will be no change to the existing price of a Prime membership, which continues to offer a bundle of benefits including free shipping, early access to deals, Prime Music, and more. With the additional \u20b9699 per year, consumers who now want an ad-free experience will have to shell out \u20b92,298 from June 17 on the discounted launch offer, and \u20b92,498 if the ad-free option is increased to \u20b9999 per year. This is more than double the original price that Prime first launched at in India, which was \u20b9999 a year. At tis price, Prime Video also becomes more expensive than JioStar, which offers a four-device, ad-free option at \u20b91,499 a year. But it is still cheaper than Netflix\u2019s top-tier subscription plan of Rs 649 per month. Currently, in terms of subscriber base, Prime Video is the second in India\u2019s OTT space, with roughly 20% share. Hotstar (Now JioStar) is the market leader. However, Live event content such as sports continue to include advertising on both Prime Video and Jiostar. Prime Video began its ad-supported rollout globally in 2024, offering US users an optional $2.99/month upgrade to continue watching without ads. The company says introducing limited advertisements allows it to \u201ccontinue investing in compelling content\u201d and scale up its long-term commitment to original programming."

            "text": "The Delhi High Court has said that a woman who left her job to care for her child is entitled to alimony, stating that her decision to stop working was not voluntary, but a result of her duty to look after her child. The order, passed on Tuesday by Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma, said that caring for a minor child often limits a parent\u2019s ability to take up full-time work, especially when there is no family support. Justice Sharma further noted that in such situations, it would be unfair to treat the woman\u2019s unemployment as her own choice. \u201cIt is well settled that the responsibility of caregiving to a minor child falls disproportionately upon the parent with custody, often limiting their ability to pursue full-time employment, especially in cases where there is no family support to take care of the child while the mother is at work,\" the ruling stated. The court refused to cancel a lower court\u2019s October 2023 decision that granted the woman and her child interim maintenance. The man had challenged this order, arguing that his wife was highly educated and had previously worked as a guest teacher earning Rs 40,000 to Rs 50,000 a month. He said the case was filed to harass him and that he could not afford the payments, as he only earned Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 a month as a lawyer in Haryana. The woman, however, told the court that she could not continue working due to her caregiving duties. She said her long commute and the lack of work near her home forced her to give up her job. The court accepted her explanation, calling it \u201creasonable and justified\". The high court directed the man to continue paying Rs 7,500 per month to his wife and Rs 4,500 towards their child. It also asked the family court to review the matter again, while allowing the current arrangement to continue in the meantime."

Shah, Madhya Pradesh\u2019s Tribal Affairs Minister, sparked a massive row by calling Colonel Sofiya Qureshi the \u201csister of terrorists\", drawing the ire of the Congress party who called for his immediate sacking. The National Commission for Women has strongly condemned the purported derogatory remarks made against Colonel Qureshi, calling for respect for women in uniform, without naming anybody. The BJP leader\u2019s remarks were severely criticised by the Congress, including party president Mallikarjun Kharge, who deemed it as an insult to the Indian Armed Forces and demanded the saffron party to sack Shah with immediate effect. \u201cA minister of the BJP government of Madhya Pradesh has made extremely insulting, shameful and vulgar remarks about our brave daughter Colonel Sofia Qureshi.

As tensions soared over the Pahalgam terror attack last month, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. India\u2019s successful military operation brought renewed attention to its indigenously developed weapons systems like Akash and BrahMos. In his address to the nation on Monday, PM Modi said Operation Sindoor proved the effectiveness of \u2018Made in India\u2019 defence equipment, and the world was now witnessing the arrival of Made in India arms as a formidable force in 21st-century warfare. India is exporting a wide range of items from ammunition, arms, sub-systems/systems and parts and components to as many as 80 countries, showing its growth from a largely import-dependent military force to a self-reliant one focusing on indigenous production. The Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs) have shown a significant increase of 42.85% in their exports in the FY 2024-25, reflecting the growing acceptability of Indian products in the global market and the ability of the Indian defence industry to be a part of the global supply chain, according to an earlier Ministry of Defence (MoD) statement. A total of 1,762 Export Authorisation were issued in FY 2024-25 compared to 1,507 in the preceding year, registering a growth of 16.92%. The total number of exporters also grew by 17.4% in the same period. The Modi government has set an ambitious target of increasing defence exports to Rs 50,000 crore by 2029. The Government has brought in many policy reforms in the past few years to boost the Indian defence industry, such as simplification of industrial licensing procedure, removal of parts and components from the license regime, extending the validity period of the license, etc."

            "title": "TRT\u2019s Propaganda Push: India Flags Turkish Broadcaster For Anti-India, Pro-Pakistan Narratives",
            "text": "India, in a significant escalation of its clampdown on foreign propaganda, has moved decisively against Turkish state-owned broadcaster TRT, accusing it of running coordinated disinformation campaigns targeting the nation\u2019s internal stability and global standing. According to top cyber intelligence officials, TRT\u2014widely viewed as a mouthpiece for President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s foreign policy\u2014has amplified anti-India propaganda through a series of media outputs aligning with Pakistani and Chinese strategic narratives. The broadcaster\u2019s content, particularly on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, has triggered national security concerns and prompted regulatory action under India\u2019s stringent IT Rules, 2021. TRT has been accused of relentlessly portraying India as an \u201coccupying force\" in Kashmir, particularly through its controversial series \u201cKashmir Under Siege\". The programme paints the Union Territory as being under illegal military control, echoing Islamabad\u2019s long-standing position. The channel has repeatedly highlighted alleged human rights violations by Indian security forces and has given a platform to Kashmiri separatists and Pakistani officials, thereby undermining India\u2019s sovereignty. Indian cyber agencies allege that TRT\u2019s campaigns are not isolated acts of journalism, but rather part of a coordinated foreign influence network. Analysts have drawn links between TRT\u2019s output and Pakistan\u2019s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), noting shared themes, synchronised messaging, and bot-driven social media amplification. The narratives often mirror Pakistan\u2019s information operations, especially during times of unrest in Kashmir or Indo-Pak border tensions. Beyond Kashmir, TRT has been found to echo Chinese and Pakistani narratives on other sensitive issues. These include: TRT\u2019s editorial line consistently frames India as an Islamophobic state, focusing heavily on domestic policies like the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC), and the Hijab controversy. Intelligence reports suggest the channel selectively amplifies fringe incidents, portraying them as evidence of systemic oppression, thereby fueling communal discord both domestically and internationally. Indian authorities have cited multiple reasons for targeting TRT and its affiliates: TRT\u2019s content was deemed to incite unrest, particularly in volatile regions like Kashmir. Intelligence inputs highlighted how some videos and articles circulated during communal tensions could radicalise youth and disrupt public order. During the 2020 Delhi riots, TRT-affiliated accounts reportedly circulated misleading footage and unverified claims, including accusations of state-sponsored violence against Muslims\u2014claims that were later debunked. The Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) flagged TRT for non-compliance with India\u2019s IT Rules (2021), including: India views TRT\u2019s coverage as part of Ankara\u2019s broader interference campaign. Turkey\u2019s routine raising of the Kashmir issue at international forums like the UNGA and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has only worsened bilateral tensions. TRT\u2019s editorial strategy is perceived as an extension of this diplomatic hostility. Sources within the Ministry of External Affairs indicated that the action against TRT sends a clear signal: India will not tolerate foreign media outlets acting as proxies for adversarial governments under the guise of journalism. \u201cFreedom of the press cannot be a cover for geopolitical subversion,\" said a senior official on condition of anonymity. As India sharpens its response to information warfare, TRT\u2019s case is expected to set a precedent for how the country handles foreign media that cross into the realm of hostile influence operations."

Broadcaster India Today said that the test was conducted at the Seaward Firing Range in Gopalpur, Odisha. Developed by Solar Defence and Aerospace Limited (SDAL), the system is designed to target hostile drone swarms. Hostile drone swarms are emerging as a major threat on the battlefield and these \u201cremote toys\", as many observers put it, have been extensively used in the Russia-Ukraine war and the Pakistani forces also used it when it intervened on behalf of terrorists following the Operation Sindoor counter terror ops. Indian forces responded befittingly and downed all the \u201cremote toys\" Pakistan launched towards Indian border districts and cities. Bhargavastra, equipped with hard-kill technology, features advanced capabilities to detect and destroy small or incoming drones at ranges of up to 2.5 kilometres. The trial involved the launch of micro rockets that met all predefined performance parameters, officials said, according to the broadcaster. Three trials of the rocket were carried out in the presence of senior Army Air Defence (AAD) officials."

            "title": "Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Matuka River Revived: How Farmers Got Their Lifeline On Course",
            "text": "The locals of Varanasi\u2019s Sewapuri have revived a \u201clost river\", with a little help from the Uttar Pradesh district administration. Once a key tributary of the river Varuna, the 27.14-kilometre Matuka, a lifeline for over 5,000 farmers across 26 villages, had faded due to neglect and encroachments. For 70-year-old Bulla Devi, a resident of Admapur village, the fading of the Matuka was more than an environmental loss\u2014it was the disappearance of a childhood memory. \u201cI used to go every day with my mother to bathe in the river. I remember it flowing in full swing. Now, it barely survives the summer,\" she says. Bulla Devi is not alone. It reflects the collective struggle of hundreds of villagers whose lives once revolved around the Matuka. For decades, the river served as a crucial source of irrigation, domestic use, and cultural identity for villages in the Sewapuri block and neighbouring Bhadohi district. Its decline over the past two decades turned fertile lands dry and pushed farmers to rely on increasingly uncertain sources of water. Ramdhani Patel of Matuka village recalled when the river ran freely through the year. \u201cFifteen years ago, there used to be water. But now, apart from the rainy season and a short stretch of winter, the river dries up,\" he says. However, he praises the recent revival efforts: \u201cAfter the digging and cleaning work, we saw water in the river even in winter. That hasn\u2019t happened in years.\" The revival was conceptualised over a year ago. The revival of the Matuka River was taken up as a focused water conservation mission by the Varanasi district administration. Led by Chief Development Officer (CDO) Himanshu Nagpal, the project was implemented in coordination with local gram panchayats. Desilting, clearing encroachments, and building rainwater harvesting structures were central to the plan. \u201cThe river had virtually disappeared in many areas. It had become a dumping ground and was encroached upon in several places. We carried out extensive desilting using JCB machines, cleared waste, and involved MGNREGA workers to manually clean parts of the river. The idea was to restore its natural course and allow water from its origin in Bhadohi to reach downstream stretches,\" said Himanshu Nagpal, CDO, Varanasi. Dinesh Yadav, a farmer from Mahnag Adamapur, said the revival is changing lives. \u201cEarlier, we used to struggle during the rabi season. This year, thanks to the water that remained during winter, we could use pumping sets to irrigate our fields. It\u2019s a big relief,\" he said. For Bachan Prasad of Ramdih village, about 800 meters from the Matuka, the revival is emotional. \u201cThe river used to flow the whole year. Then, due to poor rains and lack of upkeep, it started drying up. People began calling it a nullah. But it was our river, our pride. This initiative brought that pride back,\" he said. The impact of the revival is visible not just in water levels, but in farming practices too. In gram panchayats like Bhishan Dilawarpur, farmers have already used Matuka\u2019s water to irrigate their rabi crops. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge help. If this continues, we won\u2019t have to rely solely on borewells and tankers,\" said Kanhaiya Lal, a farmer from the area. The river, flanked by agricultural fields, has always been central to the rural economy of Sewapuri. A bridge is also under construction on the Varanasi-Bhadohi Highway over a revived stretch, signalling further integration of the river into local infrastructure. Even now, with summer at its peak, stretches of the river like those near Benipur still retain water. Locals are optimistic that with sustained effort and adequate rainfall, the Matuka can once again become a perennial river."

Remember January 2024, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s casual walk on the white beach and dives into the blue water of Lakshadweep\u2014a tropical archipelago of 36 atolls and coral reefs in the Lakshadweep Sea, off the coast of Kerala\u2014made leaders of Maldives break into a knee-jerk reaction, resorting to even racial slurs against Indians? Indians called for Maldives\u2019 boycott and the rest, they say, is history. Platforms like EaseMyTrip de-platformed flights and accommodations of Maldives and there was a name-and-shame campaign online for anyone who chose to still visit Maldives. Cancellations spiralled. In a tourist spot where Indians constitute a major market, with over 2.91 lakh and 2.41 lakh Indian tourist arrivals in 2021 and 2022 during the peak of Covid-19, Maldives got a rude shock. It took a lot of backchannel cajoling at the highest level for India to finally consider going back to business as normal. But, in between, Maldives\u2019 economy sunk. The reason for the prelude is that the world may very well experience a similar moment\u2014This time in Turkey. Turkey chose to side with Pakistan and supply it with arms and ammunition in its conflict with India, back-stabbing India which extended help after the recent earthquake. Like Turkey, the new government in Maldives led by Muizzu too was earlier perceived to be against India\u2019s national interest and courting China. Indians lost no time in asking for a complete boycott of Turkey and Azerbaijan\u2014the two countries that extended their support to Pakistan. But since the central Asian nation is yet not that popular as Turkey is, \u2018Boycott Turkey\u2019 started to trend nationally. Unlike in Maldives, Turkey touched a raw nerve\u2014Pakistan. So, senior Indian politicians, including opposition faces who wouldn\u2019t leave a chance to corner PM Narendra Modi, jumped in to attack Turkey. Former Union minister and Congress leader Rajeev Shukla asked to \u201cimmediately stop\" Indians\u2019 destination weddings in Turkey. Meanwhile, Shiv Sena (Uddhav) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi called vacationing in Turkey \u201cblood money\". In 2023, nearly 2.75 lakh Indian tourists visited Turkey, and the number rose by over 20 per cent to 3.25 lakh in 2024. Platforms like Ixigo & EaseMyTrip pulled the plug on Turkey bookings. The ire is not just restricted to tourism, but slowly turning to produce as well. Turkish apples have suddenly vanished from markets after Indian traders switched their loyalties to Iran, Washington, and New Zealand to cater to those who prefer international qualities. Government sources say Turkey needs India more\u2014for pulses, oil seeds, steel\u2014than the other way around. India had planned to increase trade with Turkey up to $20 Billion. However, with changed realities, sources in the government suggest that India will cut trade ties with Turkey as it cannot negotiate with anyone who supports a terror state. Mohamed Muizzu must be reliving his past seeing the boycott call now faced by Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan."

He stopped the war..) Congress on Tuesday night had said Trump was not only hyphenating the two countries but also comparing Prime Minister Modi with his Pakistani counterpart Shehbaz Sharif.

            "title": "Trump\u2019s Pharma Shake-Up: Indian Generic Drug Makers Stay Calm But Cautious",
            "text": "As the United States steps up efforts to curb high-drug prices, Indian drug makers are closely monitoring the developments, but remain largely unaffected. On Monday, American President Donald Trump signed an executive order implementing a \u2018Most Favoured Nation\u2019 (MFN) policy for US prescription drugs. The order mandates that drug prices in the United States be aligned with the lowest prices paid by other developed nations, particularly those in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The move, Trump claims, aims to address the wide pricing disparity where Americans pay substantially more for medicines than patients in other high-income countries. While the intent is to make drugs more affordable for American patients, Indian experts believe the order is unlikely to affect India\u2019s generic pharmaceutical industry. India\u2019s generics sector plays a vital role globally as it accounts for 90 per cent of prescription volumes in the US, while contributing to only 13 per cent of its market value. Experts also point out that the focus of the executive order seems to be primarily on patented drugs, not generics. While many industry experts believe there is no significant threat for Indian drug makers, a few consider the move as \u201ca wakeup call\" for Indian pharma. According to Vishal Manchanda, a pharma analyst at financial services firm Systematix, \u201cThe focus of this executive order is clearly the patented drugs.\" Manchanda also raised doubts about the viability of the order itself. \u201cTaking a clue from what happened with the executive order that Trump issued on similar lines towards the end of his previous term, I think this one too may not see the light of day. The court had placed an injunction on the previous Trump executive order mandating MFN-linked pricing.\" Sharing a similar assessment, Ravi Udaya Bhaskar, former Director-General of the commerce ministry\u2019s Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India (Pharmexcil), said, \u201cIndia is predominantly a generics player, and our prices are very competitive. I don\u2019t think this will have any impact on Indian generics. The President may be focusing more on patented medicines.\" He further added, \u201cThe US imports drugs worth $200 billion from various countries, mainly from Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, and others. India\u2019s share is about $10 billion, or 5 per cent of the total US drug imports. It\u2019s good that he is trying to reduce medicine prices for Americans. India\u2019s domestic drug makers, represented by the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA)\u2014which includes companies like Sun Pharma, Glenmark, Lupin, and Cipla\u2014also believe that the impact on the generics sector will be minimal. In a statement, Sudarshan Jain, Secretary General of IPA, said, \u201cThe generics industry is unlikely to be impacted, as it operates on razor-thin margins.\" Jain reiterated the crucial role of generics in the American market: \u201cIn the US, the generics industry represents 90 per cent of prescription volumes while accounting for only 13 per cent of the market value. The generics industry plays a pivotal role in ensuring medicines remain affordable and accessible. Further details on implementation mechanisms will bring more clarity.\" Ajay Srivastava, founder of GTRI and a former Indian Trade Service officer, sees this as a critical moment for Indian pharmaceutical policy. \u201cTrump\u2019s MFN pricing policy should be a wake-up call,\" he said. Srivastava cautioned that price controls in the West could push pharmaceutical multinationals to recover costs by targeting lower-cost markets like India. \u201cAs pharmaceutical companies face tighter price controls in the West, they will redouble their efforts to raise prices in markets like India. The battleground is no longer just legal\u2014it has moved to trade negotiations. India must respond with strategic clarity and unyielding resolve.\" He added, \u201cThe world depends on India\u2019s generics. Preserving this model is not only in India\u2019s interest, but it is also a moral and global necessity.\""

            "text": "Retired United States Army officer John W Spencer on Wednesday termed India\u2019s \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019 \u201ca decisive victory in modern warfare\" and said that the country has not yet declared the operation complete. He also said the new India hits back, while the India back in 2008 absorbed attacks and waited. In a lengthy X post, Spencer, who is also a researcher of urban warfare and an author, said India achieved a \u201cmassive victory\" in its operation against Pakistan. \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019 met and exceeded its strategic aims through decisive powers and a symbolic force, he said. \u201cIndia has not declared Operation Sindoor completely over. What exists now is a sensitive halt in operations\u2014some may call it a ceasefire, but military leaders have deliberately avoided that word. From a warfighting perspective, this is not merely a pause; it is a strategic hold following a rare and unambiguous military victory,\" Spencer wrote on his timeline on X. \u201cOperation Sindoor met and exceeded its strategic aims\u2014destroying terrorist infrastructure, demonstrating military superiority, restoring deterrence, and unveiling a new national security doctrine. This was not symbolic force. It was decisive power, clearly applied,\" he wrote. Referencing the Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed the lives of 26 innocent tourists on April 22, Spencer mentioned that the responsibility of the attack was claimed by The Resistance Front (TRF), an offshoot of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). \u201cIndia was attacked. On April 22, 2025, 26 Indian civilians, mostly Hindu tourists, were massacred in Pahalgam, Jammu & Kashmir. The Resistance Front (TRF), an offshoot of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), claimed responsibility. As has been the case for decades, the group is backed by Pakistan\u2019s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI),\" Spencer wrote on X. \u201cBut unlike previous attacks, this time India didn\u2019t wait. It didn\u2019t appeal for international mediation or issue a diplomatic demarche. It launched warplanes. On May 7, India initiated Operation Sindoor, a swift and precisely calibrated military campaign. The Indian Air Force struck nine terrorist infrastructure targets inside Pakistan, including headquarters and operational hubs for Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba. The message was clear: terror attacks launched from Pakistani soil will now be treated as acts of war,\" he added. Spencer also hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and mentioned how he made firm that India would not tolerate any nuclear blackmail. \u201cPrime Minister Narendra Modi made the new doctrine unmistakable: \u201cIndia will not tolerate any nuclear blackmail. India will strike precisely and decisively at the terrorist hideouts developing under the cover of nuclear blackmail.\" More than a retaliation, this was the unveiling of a strategic doctrine. As Modi said, \u201cTerror and talks can\u2019t go together. Water and blood can\u2019t flow together.\",\" he wrote. Spencer also wrote down how India\u2019s \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019 was executed in phases. \u201cOperation Sindoor was executed in deliberate phases Also underlining the impacts of the \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019, Spencer wrote, India showcased its ability to strike any target in Pakistan at will\u2014terror sites, drone coordination hubs, even airbases. Meanwhile, Pakistan was unable to penetrate a single defended area inside India. That is not parity. That is overwhelming superiority. And that is how real deterrence is established. Spencer, in his X post, also highlighted that the situation was dealt with by India single-handedly, without seeking international mediation. \u201cIndia handled this crisis without seeking international mediation. It enforced doctrine on sovereign terms, using sovereign means. Operation Sindoor was not about occupation or regime change. It was limited war executed for specific objectives. Critics who argue India should have gone further miss the point. Strategic success isn\u2019t about the scale of destruction\u2014it\u2019s about achieving the desired political effect,\" he wrote. \u201cIndia was not fighting for vengeance. It was fighting for deterrence. And it worked. India\u2019s restraint is not weakness\u2014it is maturity. It imposed costs, redefined thresholds, and retained escalation dominance. India didn\u2019t just respond to an attack. It changed the strategic equation,\" Spencer mentioned. \u201cIn an age where many modern wars spiral into open-ended occupations or political confusion, Operation Sindoor stands apart. This was a demonstration of disciplined military strategy: clear goals, aligned ways and means, and adaptive execution in the face of unpredictable escalation. India absorbed a blow, defined its objective, and achieved it\u2014all within a contained timeframe.\" \u201cThe use of force in Operation Sindoor was overwhelming yet controlled\u2014precise, decisive, and without hesitation. That kind of clarity is rare in modern war. In an era defined by \u201cforever wars\" and cycles of violence without strategic direction, Sindoor stands apart. It offers a model of limited war with clearly defined ends, matched ways and means, and a state that never relinquished the initiative.\" Comparing the India back in 2008 \u2013 during the UPA\u2019s regime, and the present India, Spencer wrote, \u201cThe India of 2008 absorbed attacks and waited. This India hits back\u2014immediately, precisely, and with clarity.\" \u201cModi\u2019s doctrine, India\u2019s advancing domestic defense industry, and the professionalism of its armed forces all signal a country no longer preparing for the last war. It is preparing for the next one. The halt in operations is not the end of Operation Sindoor. It is a pause. India holds the initiative. If provoked again, it will strike again,\" he wrote. \u201cThis is deterrence restored. This is a new doctrine revealed. And it should be studied by all nations confronting the scourge of state-sponsored terrorism. Operation Sindoor was a modern war\u2014fought under the shadow of nuclear escalation, with global attention, and within a limited objective framework. And by every measure that matters, it was a strategic success\u2014and a decisive Indian victory,\" his X post read. \u201cAfter just four days of calibrated military action, it is objectively conclusive: India achieved a massive victory. Operation Sindoor met and exceeded its strategic aims\u2014destroying terrorist infrastructure, demonstrating military superiority, restoring deterrence, and unveiling\u2026 https://t.co/YvxCjaJJRs\u2014 John Spencer (@SpencerGuard) May 14, 2025 India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7 to destroy nine terror infrastructures in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir in retaliation to the Pahalgam terror attack. All subsequent retaliations to Pakistani offensives were carried out under \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019."

            "text": "In a big relief for Indian patients, Denmark-based Novo Nordisk said it is not discontinuing India\u2019s largest-selling insulin brand, Human Mixtard. In recent weeks, concerns had been growing among diabetes patients over reports of a possible discontinuation of Human Mixtard. However, the largest-selling insulin brand will remain available in vials and not pens. In an interview, Vikrant Shrotriya, Managing Director, Novo Nordisk India, told News18, \u201cNovo Nordisk India confirms that it is not discontinuing Human Mixtard in India and will continue to supply it in vial presentation along with other human insulins, including Human Actrapid and Human Insulatard.\" The company\u2019s decision aligns with its global strategy. Globally, the Danish drug-maker is gradually winding up production of human insulin pens as it focuses on ramping up manufacturing of its latest and popular obesity or diabetes injections, including the blockbuster drug, Ozempic. \u201cIn India, we will be phasing out human insulin in Penfill and FlexPen gradually by the end of this year. However, we continue to remain a very strong player with the largest insulin formulation offerings in India in all three generations, including human insulin, modern insulin and new generation insulin.\" Shrotriya explained that as part of the global portfolio consolidation, Novo Nordisk has decided to phase out certain insulin products or devices, \u201cwhich reflects our ongoing efforts to continually improve our existing product offerings and to ensure that maximum patients have access to the most effective and innovative treatments available, globally\". Despite the price control, according to Pharmarack data, Mixtard was the eleventh most-selling brand in India in April, with its moving annual turnover (MAT) standing at Rs 766 crore. The second-largest insulin brand also comes from Novo Nordisk\u2019s portfolio, Ryzodeg, with a MAT of Rs 593 crore, followed by Sanofi\u2019s Lantus. In high-income countries or even in India, for those who can afford it, most people with diabetes now rely on modern insulin, as this kind of product offers more precise blood sugar control and greater flexibility in dosing. However, in low- and middle-income countries or for people who want cheaper options, human insulin remains the more widely used option. It\u2019s significantly cheaper and easier to produce. However, it doesn\u2019t always provide the same level of control or convenience which can be achieved by the latest insulin options. The company believes that \u201cof the overall patients on insulin in India, only 10 per cent are impacted,\" with this decision to phase out penfill and flexpen versions. \u201cThey will have the choice of transitioning to modern and new generation insulin or continue human insulin through vials or other treatment options available in the market, based on the recommendation from their physician,\" Shrotriya said, adding that \u201cthe remaining 90 per cent of patients using insulin remain unimpacted\". \u201cWe continue our unwavering commitment towards people with diabetes by continuing to serve every \u2018one in two\u2019 patients in India who require insulin,\" he said. \u201cAccordingly, we are doing everything we can to liaise early with health authorities, support healthcare professionals, trade partners and patients in the transition to other treatment options.\" Currently, Novo Nordisk claims that it is the only company in India offering three generations of insulins to patients living with diabetes. On being asked if this withdrawal will affect their overall insulin portfolio and research and development plans in India, Shrotriya explained that \u201cNovo Nordisk India contributes around 10 per cent to more than 40 global trials across therapy areas\". \u201cWe continue to invest in R&D to bring more innovations for the benefit of people living with serious chronic diseases, including improved insulins such as glucose-sensitive insulin, beta-cell replacement therapies and once-weekly insulin therapy.\""

From their earliest days, the brother and sister were constant companions, navigating life side-by-side. Tragically, in the early hours of May 7, this close connection extended even to their deaths, as they were killed within moments of each other by cross-border shelling from Pakistan. \u201cThey died within minutes of each other,\" their maternal uncle, Adil Pathan, recounted to The Indian Express. Urba and Zain were among the 27 fatalities, including security personnel, resulting from the intense shelling in Jammu and Kashmir. Their father, Rameez, a teacher, sustained grave injuries in the same incident. The deadly shelling occurred against a backdrop of heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, following a terror attack that claimed 26 lives. On the same day as the twins\u2019 deaths, May 7, India launched retaliatory strikes targeting terrorist sites in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Pakistan. Originally hailing from Kalai village, about 10 km from Poonch town, the twelve-year-old twins Urba and Zain had recently relocated with their parents, Rameez (47) and Ursha Khan (in her 40s), to a rented house in Poonch just two months prior, seeking better educational opportunities at Christ School where they were in Class 4 and had recently celebrated their birthday, according to their uncle Adil. The twins and their father, Rameez, were the first to emerge, Adil recounted. It was at that moment that a shell struck nearby, instantly killing Urba and Zain and severely injuring Rameez. Amidst the chaos of people fleeing for safety, Adil managed to get all three into his vehicle and rushed them to the Poonch district hospital, where the young twins were tragically declared dead."

The court\u2019s observation came while granting bail to a man whose wife died by suicide in her in-laws\u2019 house in March 2024, less than five years into their marriage. The woman\u2019s parents had accused the husband of dowry harassment, physical abuse, and having an extramarital relationship. He was subsequently booked under sections 498A (cruelty), 304B (dowry death), and 306 (abetment to suicide) of the law and was taken into custody. Granting him bail on Tuesday, Justice Sanjeev Narula noted, \u201cEven if we assume that there was an affair, it does not in itself fall under the category of cruelty or provocation to suicide, unless it is proved that the purpose of this relationship was to deliberately torture the wife mentally.\" The court also noted that the affair could not be linked to dowry death unless it was proven that the wife was pressured to bring dowry due to the affair or was mentally tortured because of it. The family of the deceased claimed that the husband had a relationship with a colleague and beat the wife when she objected. They also alleged that she was pressured to bring money from her parents to pay for the car\u2019s EMI. However, the court found these claims weak as the wife had never filed a complaint about them with any police station or forum. Additionally, the court also said that the accused had already been in jail since March, the chargesheet had been filed and the trial was not expected to begin soon. With no risk of evidence tampering, the court concluded that further detention was not justified. Consequently, the husband was released on a personal bond of Rs 50,000 with two bail conditions."

To contain the outbreak and safeguard animals, the park management has issued a strict set of biosafety protocols. Regional Forest Officer of Etawah will deploy three inspection teams to monitor the park premises daily, especially for any cases of deceased wild or free-ranging birds. These teams will report any such findings immediately, and regular sanitisation of the Safari Park will be ensured. The park\u2019s closure underscores growing concerns over the spread of avian flu among India\u2019s wildlife sanctuaries and zoological parks."

Last year, 3.8 lakh people travelled to either Azerbaijan or Turkey from India,\" the co-founder of EaseMyTrip said. Further informing about the loss to Turkey and Azerbaijan with Indians cancelling their visits, Pitti informed that if you take a modest 60,000-70,000 rupees per passenger spent, it equates to somewhere around 2,500 to 3,000 crores, which was spent by Indians in these countries. \u201cNow, this money will probably come back to us in the form of these countries choosing to give their arsenals, their weaponry to Pakistan and hitting back on them, which is why it is important for us Indians to know where to spend our money,\" EaseMyTrip\u2019s Prashant Pitti said while taking a firm stand against the countries supplying weapons to Pakistan. In addition to EaseMyTrip, Ixigo CEO Aloke Bajpai also on Saturday announced that the platform is suspending all flight and hotel bookings for Turkey, China and Azerbaijan. \u201cEnough is Enough! Blood and Bookings won\u2019t flow together,\" he said. India is taking a firm stand against the countries siding with Pakistan amid rising tensions between India and Pakistan following the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack. Turkey and Azerbaijan are facing a massive boycott in the country, with prominent Indian businesses and even politicians voicing support. This came after Turkey not only sided with Pakistan, while the rest of the world was condemning the heinous terror attack in J&K\u2019s Pahalgam, but Turkish Songar drones were also used by the Pakistan Army to target India\u2019s military bases and civilian infrastructure."

Social media videos also showed Bengaluru received very heavy rain on Tuesday, with knee-deep waterlogging witnessed at many places. On Tuesday, the India Meteorological Department had said the southwest monsoon has advanced into parts of the south Bay of Bengal, south Andaman Sea, Nicobar Islands and some areas of the north Andaman Sea. The weather office also said that conditions are favourable for the monsoon to advance further into more parts of the south Arabian Sea, Maldives and Comorin area, more areas of the south Bay of Bengal, the entire Andaman and Nicobar Islands, remaining parts of the Andaman Sea, and parts of the central Bay of Bengal over the next three to four days. The primary rain-bearing system is likely to reach Kerala on May 27, earlier than the usual date of June 1, according to the weather department. According to some reports, regional weather experts have noted the presence of an upper air cyclonic circulation over the Andaman Sea, which may lead to the formation of a low-pressure system between May 16 and 22. Forecasters have also suggested that the system could strengthen into a cyclone named \u2018Shakti\u2019 in between May 23 and 28. \u201cAn upper air cyclonic circulation lay over Andaman Sea between 1.5 km and 7.6 km above mean sea level, tilting south-westwards with height at 0300 UTC of today, 13th May, 2025,\" the IMD stated in a press release on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the weather department has issued a yellow alert in the districts of Karnataka, warning residents to expect more pre-monsoon showers until May 16. The weather forecast in Kolkata indicated a partly cloudy sky for Wednesday, with chances of thunderstorms and light to moderate rain. In April, the IMD had forecast above-normal cumulative rainfall in the 2025 monsoon season, ruling out the possibility of El Nino conditions, which are associated with below-normal rainfall in the Indian subcontinent."

While Pakistan kept denying its air bases were hit, an X handle named Alpha Defence shared these images from Kawa Space to expose Pakistan\u2019s lies. Ultimately, India knew the truth. \u201cThese images back India\u2019s claims and show the real impact of our nation\u2019s operations. In the fog of conflict, proof is power \u2014 and we found it,\" Kris Nair, founder and CEO, told CNN-News18 in an interview. He says Kawa Space is a global intelligence and defence space company which he started in 2019. \u201cWe did this analysis with a fellow start-up, Kepler Aerospace BLR. We shared our findings in open domain with a few specialist magazines, including Alpha Defence,\" Nair told CNN-News18. These satellite images were widely cited to expose Pakistan and prove the dominance of India\u2019s big attack on a nuclear-powered Pakistan. When asked if his start-up has a nationalistic fervour, Nair said: \u201cIndia is not just borders and slogans. It is rhythm, memory, and soul. And we believe: The sword, when drawn for the right reasons, is not violence\u2014it is reverence in motion.\" He chose not to comment on the issue if India hit the Kirana Hills too where Pakistan\u2019s nuclear facilities are believed to be located. Nair had shared a satellite image of the Kirana Hills on which Air Force made a cryptic remark. Nair belongs to Thiruvanthapuram, Kerala, and believes in bringing the power of satellite imagery for the benefit of the people. He says he is building critical space infrastructure for the Nation States. He earlier led India\u2019s first private space mission ExseedSat01 on SpaceX SSO and won a historic contract from ISRO for his team. The satellite imagery that Nair\u2019s firm provided of the damage to the Pakistani air bases has proved the military superiority of India and how India used its missiles to target these military facilities in key centers like Rawalpindi, Islamabad, and Karachi."

This directive marks a clear shift in operational posture. Earlier, the force had imposed a blanket cancellation of all leaves amid the uncertainty. Troops who were being positioned for immediate deployment to Jammu & Kashmir are now being instructed to remain at their current stations until further orders. A senior official told News18 that the armed forces remain vigilant at the border, while a sufficient number of CAPF personnel are deployed internally to maintain law and order in J&K. \u201cThe troops can be redeployed at very short notice if needed,\" the official added. Officials note that the previously planned restructuring of units\u2014intended to optimise border response\u2014has been deemed unnecessary for the time being. Forces across J&K will continue in their current roles and locations, signalling a return to routine readiness rather than an escalated stance."

India\u2019s response came in view of China\u2019s continuing efforts to assert claims over the north-eastern Indian state. Last year in April, China rechristened 30 locations in Arunachal Pradesh with Chinese and Tibetan names. Meanwhile, India has stayed firm in its rejection of China\u2019s attempt to claim territories in Arunachal Pradesh and asserted that the state is an integral part of India. Beijing in the past had released four lists attempting to rename several places in Arunachal Pradesh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). In 2017, the country released the initial list of \u2018standardised\u2019 names for six locations in the Indian territory. This was succeeded by a second list comprising 15 places in 2021, with another list featuring names for 11 additional places released in 2023. Then, a list of 30 places was released in April 2024."

            "text": "Operation Sindoor lasted four days, and India hit not just the terror headquarters in Pakistan but also 11 of its airbases, destroying nearly 20% of Pakistan\u2019s air force infrastructure. This swift victory was achieved without the costs of a prolonged war like the Russia-Ukraine conflict. India would hope it can now reap the dividends of this success and channel its resources towards peaceful growth. In fact, the pummelling of Pakistan could usher in several years of relative calm, free from major terror disruptions. This could allow India to focus on comprehensive national development. The military victory may have been swift, but its implications are long-term, ushering in a phase of strategic confidence and opportunity. The Indian economy is booming, the stock market is on the rise, and a US-India trade deal is around the corner. Pakistan\u2019s role as a terror state has been exposed through a military engagement, which was also a statement of intent, capability, and future direction. India has avoided falling into any geopolitical trap or getting entangled in drawn-out global proxy dynamics. Pakistan knows that there is now a high cost of sponsoring terror in India. Before pausing hostilities on Pakistan\u2019s desperate plea, Narendra Modi made it clear\u2014any terror act against India now on will now be treated as an act of war. There will be no difference made between terrorists and their state sponsor, Pakistan. The era of dossier diplomacy, or sending letters to get justice for terror victims, is over\u2014now, India will strike. India is now a major military power with a credible deterrence capability. We have long-range missiles, an efficient air defence network, and a strong leadership spine that gives a free hand to the military. Pakistan\u2019s internal vulnerabilities show that in India, it\u2019s the beginning of a transformative era. Going ahead, Pakistan may well implode while India becomes stronger. India\u2019s success in Operation Sindoor also sends a message to the world that India is not to be trifled with. As PM Modi has said, India is the land of both Buddha and Guru Gobind Singh Ji, who declared, \u201cI will make one warrior fight against 125,000\u2026 I will make sparrows defeat hawks\u2026 only then will I be called Guru Gobind Singh.\" The PM also said that the success of Operation Sindoor has strengthened the nation\u2019s resolve, unified the country, safeguarded India\u2019s borders, and elevated India\u2019s pride to new heights. Prime Minister Modi emerges from this episode with enhanced credibility, both domestically and internationally. India only gets to build from here."

He termed Op Sindoor as the new normal, while also stating in no uncertain terms that India will no longer tolerate the \u201cnuclear blackmail\u201d by Pakistan. The Opposition, meanwhile, has demanded answers from the government over the \u201cinterference\u201d by US President Donald Trump into India-Pakistan affairs, calling for a special session of Parliament on Operation Sindoor and the \u201cunderstanding\u201d that followed on May 10 between the two countries to halt military operations on the Line of Control and the International Border. Days after Operation Sindoor was launched on May 7, Chief of Defence Staff, General Anil Chauhan along with tri-services Chiefs, called on President Droupadi Murmu at Rashtrapati Bhavan and briefed her about the operation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a Cabinet Committee on Security meeting at his residence today. This was the third CCS meeting since the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22. The CDS and tri-services chiefs provided a direct perspective from the Apex Leadership of Indian Armed Forces into the successful conduct of Operation Sindoor.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Adampur Airbase yesterday and interacted with the air warriors. He also shared a video of his interaction with them on X. The Prime Minister addressed them on the occasion with the S-400 air defence system in the background, from where he gave out a stern warning to Pakistan against plotting any terrorist activities in India. As part of the nationwide yatra, the BJP leaders and workers will hold bike rallies, public gatherings, and flag hoisting ceremonies, among other activities, to pay tributes to the armed forces for their exemplary success in Operation Sindoor. The BJP launched a nationwide 10-day \u2018Tiranga Yatra\u2019 in the national capital yesterday to celebrate the success of Operation Sindoor. The yatra will culminate on May 23. The Bharatiya Janata Party will carry out \u2018Tiranga Yatra\u2019 in several parts of the country today to honour the Indian armed forces for their success in Operation Sindoor, which was launched on May 7 to avenge the killings of tourists in Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s Pahalgam on April 22."

            "text": "The Patna High Court has said that adulterous life is no doubt a disqualification for any wife to get maintenance from her husband under Section 125 CrPC; however, any physical relationship of a lady with any person prior to her marriage does not come within the definition of \u201cadultery\" because adultery is an offence against one\u2019s spouse. A single-judge bench of Jitendra Kumar said the adulterous life of any wife subsequent to her marriage is undoubtedly a disqualification for any married wife to get maintenance from her husband. \u201cHowever, \u2018living in adultery\u2019 denotes a continuous course of conduct and not isolated acts of immorality. One or two lapses from virtues may be acts of adultery, but would not be sufficient to show that the woman was \u2018living in adultery\u2019. A few moral lapses and a return to a normal life can not be said to be living in adultery. If the lapse is continued and followed up by a further adulterous life, the woman can be said to be \u2018living in adultery\u2019,\" the bench said. The court rejected a plea by the husband that his wife was living in adultery with her brother-in-law, so she was not entitled to maintenance under Section 125 of CrPC. \u201cAs per Explanation (b) to Section 125(1) CrPC, wife includes even divorced wife and she is entitled to get maintenance under Section 125 CrPC if she has not remarried and it is not a case of the petitioner that his divorced wife has remarried,\" the bench said."

The purported video, which has gone viral on social media, shows the alleged Army officer, who named himself and his Commanding Officer, blaming the Indian government for the dastardly terror attack last month in Pahalgam, in which 26 tourists were killed. However, the PIB said the video was fake and that the Army officer had not reported for duty since March 2025, and neither was he in contact with his relatives. \u201cPlease stay alert.

According to Army sources, the rifleman has been missing since he applied for leave. A case has been registered in this regard, and it appears the video may have been made under duress or coercion. Since the Pahalgam terror attack, the internet has been rife with misinformation. While a terrorist organisation linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) called \u201cThe Resistance Front\" (TRF) claimed responsibility for the attack, Pakistan has denied involvement in the incident. Reeling from devastating strikes by India, Pakistan has taken to peddling fake news and misinformation on social media in a deliberate attempt to distort international perception and manipulate public perception. The efforts of the PIB Fact Check unit in debunking fake news and dispelling myths have been vital in helping citizens distinguish between facts and false information. The Pahalgam attack prompted India to attack terror camps in Pakistan as part of Operation Sindoor.

India should make the Pakistan military pay the costs of the conflict, he added. Speaking about US President Donald Trump inserting himself into the situation, Zakaria said, \u201cIt is difficult to tell what exactly happened\u2026but it is clear that Trump quickly wanted to take credit (for the ceasefire) and did what he often does\u2026before thinking and consulting his officials\u2026And that is why his tweet and language used were taken badly in India.\" Trump treated both India and Pakistan as equals, said Zakaria. \u201cWhat India worked hard for 20 years was undone in one tweet\u2026Unfortunately, it is how Trump operates\u2026he did the same with tariffs,\" he added. The Indian government should convey to Washington the problems it had with Trump\u2019s approach, Zakaria said. \u201cAs PM Modi suggested, the meeting that Trump tweeted about was not true,\" he added. I don\u2019t know why the Indian government is so hesitant.\" India was attacked and still had to be restrained, said Zakaria. \u201cYou can push hard, but these groups want this,\" he said. \u201cIndia has the most to lose\u2026India is growing whereas jihadi groups need conflict. It is strategically wise to do what India did.

Backed by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Singh handpicked elite pilots, shaped the rules of engagement and gave the Indian Air Force its clearest war signal in years. The result: an admission of damage from the enemy itself. Pakistan Army spokesperson Lt General Ahmed Sharif confirmed on national television that Indian missiles struck key military targets, including Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi, Murid base in Chakwal and Rafiqui base in Punjab\u2019s Jhang district. Satellite imagery released by a Chinese satellite firm (MIZAZVISION) showed the damage at Pakistan\u2019s Nur Khan Airbase. OSINT expert Damien Symon released the images on his X profile and showed that the Nur Khan air base facility had sustained heavy damages and and missiles demolished military support trucks inside the Rawalpindi-based air base. Singh\u2019s leadership and strategic brilliance were pivotal in the success of the operation, which crippled a critical Pakistan Air Force base and demonstrated India\u2019s air superiority. Sources said the strike forced Pakistan Army Chief General Asim Munir into hiding in a bunker for two hours. Known for his tactical acumen, the IAF Chief handpicked the finest pilots, ensuring that each strike was executed with unmatched precision. This was a well-planned maneuver designed to send a clear message of strength and dominance in the skies. The strike, which targeted key Pakistan Air Force (PAF) infrastructure, was carried out after final clearance from NSA Doval, sources said. The results were immediate and devastating. Pakistan\u2019s military confirmed the deaths of 11 personnel, including 5 from the PAF. Indian armed forces viewed the Pakistani military\u2019s actions as a misadventure that warranted a strong and calculated response after which the IAF bombed Pakistan\u2019s crucial airbases in Rahim Yar Khan, Sukkur, Chunian, Pasrur, Sialkot and Nur Khan in a coordinated assault. The attack stunned Pakistan to such an extent that Munir was swiftly moved from his official residence to a secure location, as Pakistan scrambled to respond, the sources said. The strategic brilliance behind the mission was the psychological impact it had on the enemy. Air Chief Singh\u2019s decision to target Nur Khan was not only a tactical victory but a bold statement of the IAF\u2019s ability to dominate the skies and disrupt PAF\u2019s operations. Born on October 27, 1964, in Delhi, Amar Preet Singh was commissioned into the IAF as a fighter pilot in December 1984. An alumnus of the National Defence Academy, Defence Services Staff College and National Defence College, he is a qualified flying instructor and an experimental test pilot with over 5,000 hours of flying experience on various aircraft. Throughout his distinguished career spanning nearly four decades, Singh has held several key positions, including commanding an operational fighter squadron and a frontline air base. He played a pivotal role in the MiG-29 upgrade project in Moscow and was instrumental in the flight testing of the indigenous Light Combat Aircraft, Tejas, serving as the Project Director at the National Flight Test Centre. His leadership was also evident during his tenure as the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Central Air Command and as the Vice Chief of the Air Staff."

Chairing a high-level review meeting on the National TB Elimination Programme (NTEP), he lauded early detection and treatment of tuberculosis (TB) patients in 2024 and said it should be scaled up nationwide, according to a statement. He reaffirmed India\u2019s commitment to eliminating TB from the country. The prime minister reviewed the recently-concluded 100-day TB Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan, covering high-focus districts, during which 12.97 crore vulnerable individuals were screened and 7.19 lakh cases, including 2.85 lakh asymptomatic, detected. Modi stressed the need to analyse the trends of TB patients based on urban or rural areas as well as their occupations. As healthcare technology improves, Nikshay Mitras (supporters of TB patients) should be encouraged to use technology to connect with TB patients. They can help patients understand the disease and its treatment using interactive and easy-to-use technology, Modi said. The prime minister said that since TB had become curable with regular treatment, there should be less fear and more awareness among the public. He highlighted the importance of cleanliness through Jan Bhagidari as a key step in eliminating TB. During the review meeting, Modi noted the encouraging findings of the WHO Global TB Report, 2024, that affirmed an 18 per cent reduction in TB incidence (from 237 to 195 per lakh population between 2015 and 2023) at double the global pace, 21 per cent decline in TB mortality (from 28 to 22 per lakh population), and 85 per cent treatment coverage, reflecting the programme\u2019s growing reach and effectiveness."

Among the defences deployed, the Akash missile emerged as a star performer, its performance so decisive that even the country\u2019s top military brass acknowledged its pivotal role in neutralising Pakistan\u2019s offensive. For Dr Prahlada Rama Rao, the scientist who led the development of Akash, watching the missile in action during the operation was deeply emotional. \u201cIt was the happiest day of my life,\" the 78-year-old told a YouTube news channel in a rare interview. Dr Rama Rao, who once worked closely with former President and missile pioneer Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, was entrusted with leading the Akash project as its youngest project director \u2013 a leap of faith by Kalam that has now paid off spectacularly. \u201cWhen we were first developing Akash, there were doubts from within our own forces. But I believed in our team \u2013 and Dr Kalam believed in me,\" Dr Rama Rao said, adding that now that very belief saved many lives and defended the Indian skies. During Operation Sindoor, Akash was reportedly used to maximum effect. Sources indicated that multiple Pakistani drones and missiles were downed near the border sectors of Punjab and Rajasthan, with Akash batteries intercepting targets at altitudes and speeds that surprised even seasoned defence observers. Dr Rama Rao, who has also contributed to the BrahMos, Astra, and K-15 missile systems, emphasised that Akash was never intended as a weapon of aggression. \u201cThis missile is not built to provoke war. Its very purpose is deterrence; to establish peace through strength,\" he said.

Launched in 2022-23 as a pilot project under the Centre-sponsored Mission Vatsalya scheme, the initiative was first implemented in six major municipal areas: Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, and Mumbai Suburban. Following its success, the state cabinet has approved its expansion to all 29 municipal corporation areas of Maharashtra. Women and child development minister Aditi Tatkare, announcing the state cabinet decision on May 13, 2025, stated that denying these children their fundamental rights to education and healthcare constitutes social injustice. \u201cThe mobile rescue team scheme is more than a welfare initiative; it is a movement for social change. Every smile we restore to a child\u2019s face is a measure of this scheme\u2019s success,\" she said. The mobile units provide on-site medical aid, counselling, Aadhaar registration, and facilitate enrolment into anganwadis or residential schools. Children without family support are placed in child-care institutions, ensuring their immediate safety and long-term rehabilitation. The pilot phase yielded positive results, reaching 3,813 street children with services such as health screenings, nutritional assistance, and educational access. With the recent cabinet approval, Rs 8.06 crore will be allocated to deploy 31 mobile vans across 29 cities. The department is also contemplating future expansion into smaller towns, religious pilgrimage sites, and temple precincts, where many street children are often found. By providing access to education, healthcare, and emotional support, the mobile rescue teams aim to transform the lives of vulnerable children. The scheme not only caters to their immediate needs but also encourages reintegration into families or institutional support systems, highlighting the government\u2019s commitment to inclusive and child-centric development."

            "text": "Adampur Air Base: Located just 100 km from the Pakistan border, the Indian Air Force\u2019s second-largest airbase in Punjab stands as a symbol of valour, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit bringing renewed national focus to it. Located between Jalandhar and Hoshiarpur, the Adampur Air Base is a fully operational facility and the second-largest airbase of the Indian Air Force. It houses the IAF\u2019s 47th Squadron, popularly known as the \u2018Black Archers\u2019. The Adampur Air Base, which also hosts a forward deployment of the 28th Squadron (First Supersonics), has long been a vital pillar of India\u2019s air defence network and played a pivotal role in Operation Sindoor. Adampur base serves both military and commercial purposes, supporting defence operations while also facilitating commercial civil aviation activities. Adampur Air Base, established in the early 1950s, stands as the Indian Air Force\u2019s second-largest air station and holds a key position in India\u2019s military aviation legacy. The base has played a frontline role in national defence, particularly during the 1965 and 1971 wars with Pakistan. Chosen for its strategic proximity to the western front, Adampur was designed to host fighter squadrons and enable swift deployment of air power near the border. Adampur played a crucial role in the 1971 Indo-Pak war, especially after Pakistan\u2019s Operation Chengiz Khan targeted Indian airbases on December 3. While the Pathankot base sustained damage, Adampur remained fully operational, providing vital interceptor cover. Under Air Marshal Randhir Singh, the IAF pilots flew relentless sorties, including Su-7s and MiG-21s, supporting Army operations and striking targets near Lahore. Adampur Air Base is a key strategic asset for India due to its close proximity\u2014just 100 km\u2014to the Pakistan border. As one of the IAF\u2019s most vital forward-operating bases, it enables rapid response, early threat detection, and swift deployment of air assets, supporting both offensive and defensive operations along the western front. Adampur Air Base played a crucial role in Operation Sindoor, India\u2019s precision strikes on terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on May 7. Equipped with MiG-29 squadrons, Adampur conducted air-to-ground strikes on terror targets across the border, maintaining aerial superiority despite rising tensions. Following India\u2019s strikes, Pakistan launched missile and drone attacks on May 9-10, targeting key IAF bases, including Adampur. However, due to its effective air defence system and rapid threat detection, the Adampur base successfully intercepted these attacks and safeguarded its infrastructure, giving operational freedom to the IAF. Today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to the air base was seen not only as a morale booster for the security forces in the wake of Operation Sindoor but also as a strategic move to decisively counter Pakistan\u2019s disinformation campaign."

            "text": "In the drought-prone district of Jalna, where poverty and migration disrupt childhoods, a quiet revolution is taking place. A group of young people, known as Balmitras (friends of children), are stepping up to protect the most vulnerable. These youth volunteers, aged 18 to 29, ensure that children left behind when their parents migrate for work are not left alone, unsupported, or unsafe. Drawn from the same communities they serve, Balmitras offer more than just care \u2014 they offer stability, learning and emotional support. Enter the Balmitras. Their primary task is to raise awareness about the dangers of unsafe migration and promote the option of kinship care, where children stay back in villages under the care of grandparents, relatives, or trusted neighbours. Through individual and group counselling with parents, they help families choose this safer alternative. The Balmitras also run vibrant after-school programmes three times a week, offering a mix of academic support, games, life skills and psychosocial care for children of the migrant workers. These sessions provide children with a safe and nurturing space to grow, learn, and express themselves. Balmitra Bhimrao Tambe is a 30-year-old youth from Jalna district. His dedication to this cause over the last two years has earned him the title of Master Balmitra\u2014a mentor role where he now trains and appoints new Balmitras across villages. He takes pride in seeing the real change. \u201cWhen a girl refuses child marriage and chooses to continue her education, it feels like I\u2019ve done something truly meaningful,\" he said with a smile. Today, he and his fellow youth volunteers are being felicitated by the Jalna Collector for their contribution to child education and protection. Currently, the Jalna district has 649 Balmitras working across six blocks and the results are remarkable. Since 2014, the percentage of children staying back in family-based care during migration seasons has grown steadily, reaching 60.23% in 258 pilot villages. In 2024\u201325 alone, over 5,800 children stayed back in kinship care. Most were cared for by grandparents, others by extended family or trusted community members. A small number lived independently with siblings in child-headed households. Balmitras receive no monetary compensation for their work, but what they gain in skills, confidence and purpose is invaluable. \u201cThe training they receive\u2014on child rights, communication, community mobilisation\u2014helps shape their personalities and future careers. Some of our former Balmitras have even gone on to become Sarpanch, leading their villages,\" Ravi Kelgaonkar of SACRED said. Bhausaheb Gunjal from Gramin Vikas Pratishthan agreed. \u201cBalmitras play a big role in preventing child marriage. They engage with young girls and their parents, convincing them to delay marriage and support education. We\u2019ve seen many girls who once resisted early marriage now excelling academically and winning awards in school,\" he added. For thousands of children in migration-affected communities, the Balmitra initiative is more than a support system. It ensures continuity in education, safeguards their mental health, and helps them grow up in a more secure environment. It is a model that is not just working\u2014it is thriving and becoming a blueprint for other districts across Maharashtra. Alpa Vora, Child Protection Specialist at UNICEF Maharashtra, said, \u201cIn Jalna, thousands of children are forced to migrate with their families due to drought and poverty. They miss school, live in unsafe conditions, and lose access to basic services. The Balmitra initiative is changing this. Trained youth volunteers now help children stay in their villages, attend school, access health services, and participate in after school and mental wellbeing activities. This model is not just protecting children\u2014it is transforming futures.\""

On Monday, Shiv Sena leader Murji Patel led a delegation to the Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL), urging them to end their association with Celebi NAS Airport Services, which currently handles around 70% of the ground operations at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport. \u201cTurkey may not be firing weapons directly, but supplying drones that are used to target our borders is no less than a hostile act,\" said Patel. \u201cWe cannot allow a country that supports our enemy to make money off Indian infrastructure.\" The Sena has issued a 10-day ultimatum to MIAL to cancel the contract, warning of protests if no action is taken. According to Patel, the party has already spoken with the airport\u2019s CEO, who has promised to review the matter and resolve it within the given timeframe. The protest has extended beyond political circles. Traders from Pune have also expressed solidarity with the Sena\u2019s demand and announced a halt on importing Turkish products, signalling a broader push towards economic disengagement from countries perceived to be aiding Pakistan. Sena leaders clarified that the demand was not political in nature but based on national interest. With growing tensions on India\u2019s borders and increasing drone threats, especially in regions like Punjab and Jammu, concerns over Turkey\u2019s defence cooperation with Pakistan have sparked a wave of economic nationalism. The Shiv Sena\u2019s move reflects this sentiment, bringing attention to foreign companies operating in sensitive sectors. Whether or not MIAL decides to act within the 10-day deadline, the Sena has made its position clear: companies from nations that support hostile activities against India have no place in its critical infrastructure."

The attack targeted major ammunition depots and airbases such as Sargodha and Bholari, where F-16 and JF-17 fighter jets were stationed, sources said. As a result, nearly 20% of Pakistan\u2019s air force infrastructure was destroyed. Over 50 individuals, including Squadron Leader Usman Yusuf and four airmen, were killed in the bombing of Bholari airbase, they added. India says several Pakistani fighter jets were also destroyed. \u201cOn May 9-10, India became the first country to strike 11 airbases of a nuclear-armed nation in a single operation, destroying 20% of Pakistan\u2019s air force assets. High casualties were inflicted at Bholari airbase, including the death of Squadron Leader Usman Yusuf and destruction of key fighter jets,\" the sources said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already said that over 100 terrorists were killed in Operation Sindoor during the May 7 strike on terrorist headquarters in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. On May 10, within just three hours, India targeted 11 military installations, including Noor Khan, Rafiqui, Murid, Sukkur, Sialkot, Pasrur, Chunian, Sargodha, Skardu, Bholari, and Jacobabad. Satellite images before and after the strike on Shahbaz airbase in Jacobabad and the Bholari airbase clearly show the scale of destruction. The government says that on the night of May 9-10, 2025, India\u2019s counteroffensive became a historic milestone when, for the first time, a country successfully attacked the airbases of a nuclear-armed nation. This was also possible as India earlier deployed kamikaze drones with the objective of neutralising Pakistan\u2019s air defence capabilities, including disabling Lahore\u2019s air defence system, sources added. Speaking to the nation on Monday, PM Narendra Modi had said, \u201cIndia struck at the heart of Pakistan. India\u2019s drones and missiles attacked with precision.

            "text": "Hinting at an early arrival, the southwest monsoon pushed deeper into some more parts of the south Bay of Bengal, the Nicobar Islands, and the Andaman Sea on Tuesday. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the seasonal rains are most likely to commence over Kerala around May 27 (+/-4 days). The four-month monsoon season is crucial since it provides over 75% of the annual rains over the country and determines the annual agricultural production, especially for the rain-fed Kharif crops. It normally sets in over Kerala on June 1, with a standard deviation of seven days. However, since 2021, it has been arriving early, except for 2023, when it made its onset on June 4. Last year, the monsoon began over Kerala on May 31. The MeT tracks several indicators to determine its onset: minimum temperatures over northwest India, pre-monsoon showers over the southern peninsula, mean sea level pressure changes over the northwest Pacific Ocean, cloud patterns over the South China Sea, and the wind shifts in both the lower and upper atmosphere across the Indian Ocean and Indonesia. \u201cThere has been widespread rainfall over the Nicobar Islands over the past two days. The strength and depth of westerly winds have also increased continuously over parts of the south Bay of Bengal, the Nicobar Islands, and the Andaman Sea. The outgoing longwave radiation over the area has also continued to decrease, all indicating the advance of the monsoon over this part,\" said Dr RK Jenamani, senior IMD scientist. According to MeT, the conditions are becoming favourable for its further advance into some parts of the south Arabian Sea, the Maldives & Comorin area, some more parts of the Bay of Bengal, and the entire Andaman & Nicobar Islands during the next 3-4 days. The forecasters are confident of above-normal monsoon rains this year, at least 105% of the long-period average (1971-2020) of 87 cm, with a model error of +/-5% in the forecast. Maximum temperatures have soared to 39-43\u00b0C over many parts of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gangetic West Bengal, and Telangana, with heatwave conditions sweeping West Bengal until May 15. IMD warned that heatwaves are also likely to begin over Jharkhand from May 13, Uttar Pradesh from May 14, and western Rajasthan from May 15."

            "title": "Why Pakistan Army Chief Asim Munir Is More Unpopular Than Ever | Explained",
            "text": "Once hailed as a powerful, pious and calculating tactician, Pakistan\u2019s Army Chief General Asim Munir now finds himself facing growing dissent \u2013 within his own ranks, across political aisles, and among an increasingly disillusioned public. His tenure, marked by intensified hostilities with India and a crackdown on political opposition at home, has thrust him into a storm of controversy and waning popularity. Appointed as Chief of Army Staff on November 29, 2022, Munir took the helm of the country\u2019s most influential institution with a reputation for discipline, secrecy, and religious devotion \u2013 he is known as Hafiz-e-Quran, a rare distinction among top brass. But the promise of stability under his leadership has since given way to rising instability both within and beyond Pakistan\u2019s borders. Munir\u2019s leadership has been widely criticised for stoking tensions with India, particularly following the deadly Pahalgam attack in Jammu & Kashmir on April 22. India\u2019s swift retaliatory military operations rattled Pakistan, leaving its armed forces on the defensive. What followed was a near-conflict scenario that many analysts believe was the closest the nuclear-armed neighbours had come to open war in recent years. While India blames Pakistan for harbouring terror networks operating across the border, discontent is also growing over social media platforms in Pakistan that saw a surge in anti-Munir sentiments, with hashtags like #MunirOut trending for days. Critics accused him of mishandling not just foreign policy, but also domestic affairs \u2013 especially the controversial imprisonment of former prime minister Imran Khan. That move, seen as politically motivated, alienated a significant portion of the Pakistani populace, particularly Khan\u2019s massive support base and religious-political factions like those led by Maulana Fazlur Rehman. The Pakistan Army, often considered a monolith of loyalty, is reportedly showing signs of fracture. Retired generals and defence analysts claimed that Munir\u2019s high-handedness and his strategy of promoting loyalists while sidelining dissenters have sparked discontent. Some military insiders, particularly in junior ranks and among veterans, are said to be uneasy with Munir\u2019s increasing injection of religious ideology into military culture \u2013 drawing parallels to Pakistani General Zia-ul-Haq, the controversial dictator who militarised religion in the 1980s. Munir\u2019s frequent Quranic references during internal addresses and his perceived alignment with fundamentalist viewpoints have earned him the moniker \u2018Mullah Munir\u2019 among critics. Despite the growing unease, Munir remains firmly entrenched in power. In a strategic move last year, the Shahbaz Sharif government extended his tenure by five years \u2013 an amendment passed quietly in parliament that ensures his command until November 2027. This effectively insulates him from any immediate political attempts at removal, although some analysts warn that persistent unrest in the ranks could sow seeds of a future internal crisis. Opposition groups have openly speculated about the possibility of a rebellion or even a coup \u2013 a scenario that, while unlikely at present, reflects the volatility Munir now faces. Meanwhile, the Pakistani government appears increasingly sidelined, with Sharif\u2019s administration reportedly having limited control over military affairs. Munir\u2019s influence continues to loom large in Pakistan\u2019s political and security arenas, but his popularity is confined to limited, and largely hardline, religious factions. Among mainstream Pakistanis \u2013 especially urban youth, civil society voices, and democratic institutions \u2013 he is viewed with skepticism, if not outright hostility. His failure to stem the tide of terror attacks in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has further dented his standing. Some argue that while Munir was busy flexing muscles across the Line of Control, internal security disintegrated, plunging the country into deeper instability. \u201cThere is growing consensus that Munir\u2019s policies are harming Pakistan,\" noted political analyst Zahid Hussain. Even within the Pakistani Army, there is a sense that he is leading the institution into uncharted and dangerous territory, Hussain said."

However, Pakistan has undermined these principles by promoting cross-border terrorism for decades, he said. The MEA spokesperson also reaffirmed India\u2019s long-standing position that any issues related to Jammu and Kashmir must be addressed bilaterally between India and Pakistan, and that this policy remains unchanged. \u201cWe have a long-standing national position that any issues pertaining to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir have to be addressed by India and Pakistan bilaterally. That stated policy has not changed. The outstanding matter is the vacation of illegally occupied Indian territory by Pakistan,\" Jaiswal said.

India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, a historic water-sharing agreement brokered by the World Bank and signed with Pakistan in 1960.

Officials said the Pakistani Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) faced technical difficulty in reaching his Indian counterpart directly. The request was instead routed through the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi at around 12:37 PM. The message was conveyed to the External Affairs Ministry (MEA) and subsequently passed on to the nation\u2019s armed forces. \u201cThe specific date and time of the understanding was worked out between the DGMOs of both countries, commencing at 1535 HRS. The request for this call was received by MEA from the Pakistani High Commission,\" ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said. A mutually agreed time for the conversation was later fixed at 3:35 PM, following which both sides agreed to halt military actions, the MEA spokesperson said. This is the first time the MEA gave details of how the ceasefire was reached and the involvement of the ministry in the ceasefire plan. The MEA spokesperson also said that an \u201cextremely effective\" action by the Indian armed forces and the Indian Air Force (IAF) put Pakistani air bases out of action and Pakistan urged a ceasefire in the face of the might of the Indian armed forces. \u201cWhere India is concerned, our stand was clear and consistent from the start. We would target terrorist infrastructure operating out of Pakistan. If the Pakistani military stayed out, there would be no problem. If they fired on us, we would respond suitably. Till the night of 9th May, Pakistan was threatening India with a massive assault. Once their attempt failed on 10th May morning and received a devastating Indian counter-response, their tune changed and their DGMO eventually reached out to us,\" Jaiswal said at a press briefing in New Delhi. \u201cThat was the reason they were now willing to stop firing and military action. Let me be clear. It was the force of Indian arms that compelled Pakistan to stop its firing,\" the spokesperson said. \u201cLet me be clear. It was the force of Indian arms that compelled Pakistan to stop its firing,\" Jaiswal said, referring to the Saturday ceasefire. When Pakistan Army intervened to save terrorists following the successful execution of the ongoing Operation Sindoor, launched to avenge deaths of 26 innocent civilians in Pahalgam, India gave a befitting reply. Pakistan then assumed an aggressive military posture but Indian response, which saw major damage to Pakistani air bases, forced Pakistan to stand down."

He further said that India had conveyed to other countries that it was responding to the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s Pahalgam on April 22 by targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan.

An unmanned, supersonic missile, BrahMos can travel at speeds of up to Mach 3 and has a standard range of 290 km, which extends to 500 km or even 800 km in its advanced variants. It is capable of carrying a warhead weighing between 200 and 300 kilograms and can fly at altitudes up to 15 km. It can strike targets as low as 10 meters above ground level, making it highly effective for precision attacks."

This covert operation is believed to be a desperate attempt to extract sensitive information linked to the ongoing military offensive by India under Operation Sindoor. The revelation emerged amid growing reports of suspicious phone activity in the Khajuwala sector, close to the India-Pakistan border. According to Amarjeet Chawla, the Circle Officer of Khajuwala, multiple residents have reported receiving misleading calls. \u201cIt\u2019s true that people are getting fake calls.

Under the guise of Indian defence personnel, the caller attempts to build credibility by sharing fake identification documents via WhatsApp and introducing themselves as high-ranking military officers.

Sources claimed that incidents such as a suspected radiation leak in Pakistan\u2019s Kirana Hills region, coupled with sightings of advanced US-made B-350 reconnaissance aircraft, have sent shockwaves through Pakistan\u2019s defence establishment.

On May 6, Mumbai airport received a call claiming a bomb was on board an IndiGo flight arriving from Chandigarh, which was later confirmed to be a hoax."

He also highlighted that over 100 terrorists were killed in Operation Sindoor. India and other international actors have frequently raised concerns over Pakistan\u2019s \u201cselective counterterrorism\" approach, highlighting how groups operating in Kashmir or against Afghan interests often enjoyed safe havens.

Modi also praised the Indian Air Force (IAF) for completing its objectives during the recently-conducted terror operation, Operation Sindoor. During the counter-terror operation, IAF destroyed nine terrorist hideouts deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). This led to a retaliation from the Pakistani Army, who intervened on behalf of the terrorists, which brought India and Pakistan close to the brink of war, with Pakistani upping its nuclear sabre-rattling. \u201cOur \u2018lakshman rekha\u2019 for Pakistan is very clear; any terror attack will be met with definitive reply on our own conditions.

IAF struck headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke (Markaz Taiba) and took out another indoctrination centre and base of JeM in Bahawalpur among nine other targets. These camps, some funded by Osama Bin Laden and some where 26/11 perpetrator Ajmal Kasab trained, have been used for carrying out attacks on India and destabilizing the Kashmir region and the broader South Asia region. PM Modi also highlighted that IAF, the Indian Army and the Indian Navy gave a befitting reply to the Pakistani Army. \u201cPakistan will not get any sleep for a long time just thinking of our drones and missiles. Our Army, Air Force and Navy personnel made the Pakistani army bite the dust and showed them their place.

            "text": "What began as an IISc student\u2019s industrial project in a modest Bengaluru laboratory has now become a critical lifeline for Indian defence forces. FIBROPLUG, an ingenious haemostatic dressing developed through a dynamic collaboration between the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and city-based start-up Fibroheal Woundcare Pvt Ltd, is providing rapid and effective bleeding control in urgent battlefield scenarios along the nation\u2019s borders. This patented technology, a silk-chitosan composite haemostat, boasts a unique bio-composite formulation that swiftly clots blood while simultaneously forming a protective barrier over the wound. This dual action makes FIBROPLUG an indispensable tool for military healthcare professionals operating in challenging, high-pressure environments where every second counts. A significant advantage of FIBROPLUG lies in its innovative design. Unlike traditional chitosan-based bandages that often adhere to the skin, causing potential re-bleeding upon removal, FIBROPLUG incorporates a layer of silk. This smooth interface prevents adhesion, allowing for easy and atraumatic removal without disrupting the healing process. The journey from concept to deployment began when Fibroheal approached IISc with a critical need in the homeostasis market. A student project in 2018-19, under the Prime Minister\u2019s Research Fellows (PMRF) scheme, laid the groundwork for FIBROPLUG. The product\u2019s patent is jointly held by IISc and Fibroheal, highlighting the success of this academic-industry partnership. Following rigorous testing and regulatory approvals, full-scale manufacturing commenced in late 2024. Today, FIBROPLUG is being utilised by Indian defence forces across 30 units, including field hospitals. \u201cThe incorporation of a silk layer to the chitosan base was key,\" explained professor Kaushik Chatterjee of IISc to CNN-News18. \u201cWhile chitosan is excellent for inducing blood clotting, its stickiness can cause issues. The silk layer ensures effective clotting without the risk of re-bleeding upon removal.\" Vivek Mishra, CEO of Fibroheal, emphasises the product\u2019s life-saving potential, stating, \u201cExcessive bleeding accounts for a significant percentage of battlefield fatalities. FIBROPLUG\u2019s rapid absorption and coagulation capabilities can dramatically improve survival rates.\" FIBROPLUG stands as a testament to Indian scientific ingenuity and the transformative power of collaboration, bridging the gap between laboratory innovation and critical real-world applications, ultimately saving lives on the front lines."

            "text": "Before the 1971 war broke out, then US President Richard Nixon warned India against taking military action. During a meeting with Nixon and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, then Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi reportedly felt insulted and walked out. Amid the recent India-Pakistan escalation, a claim has resurfaced on social media suggesting that Indira Gandhi also ignored a phone call from Nixon. Some posts claim the US President calls her four times in 16 days but she refused to speak to him. In 2005, the US State Department declassified taped conversations between Nixon and Kissinger from the period leading up to the 1971 war. These records contain no explicit mention of Nixon personally calling Indira Gandhi or her refusing to take his call. Most communication between the two leaders occurred through formal letters and diplomatic channels. For instance, Indira Gandhi wrote to Nixon on December 12, 1971, a letter recently highlighted by senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh in a social media post. In his book White House Years, Henry Kissinger wrote, \u201cWe tried to contact Indira Gandhi, but she was not available.\" However, he did not clarify whether she was deliberately avoiding the call or genuinely occupied. On the other hand, Indira Gandhi\u2019s advisor PN Dhar noted in his book Indira Gandhi, The Emergency, and Indian Democracy that the PM was deeply engaged in meetings with military commanders and diplomats. Given the wartime urgency, he wrote, any call from Nixon would not have been treated as a priority. According to biographer Katherine Frank in Indira : The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi, Indira Gandhi was aware of Nixon\u2019s hostility and may have deliberately delayed communication to avoid a direct confrontation. Historian Gary J Bass, in his acclaimed book The Blood Telegram: Nixon, Kissinger and a Forgotten Genocide, wrote that Nixon was furious India refused to yield to his threats. Whether Indira Gandhi ignored his calls or simply delayed responding remains debated, but many believe that her perceived defiance became a lasting symbol of her firm and uncompromising leadership. Whether or not the phone call incident actually occurred, it became a symbol of Indira Gandhi\u2019s resolve during the 1971 war. Political commentators have argued that it reflected her refusal to bow to US pressure and highlighted India\u2019s growing strategic confidence, strengthened by the Soviet Union treaty. While there is no concrete evidence she ignored Nixon\u2019s calls, it\u2019s clear she resisted American pressure. Many see this episode as emblematic of India\u2019s assertive foreign policy and Indira Gandhi\u2019s unshakable leadership. The crisis in East Pakistan, marked by severe repression and a mass refugee movement into India, prompted Indira Gandhi to take the bold step of declaring war on Pakistan in December 1971. This led to a swift 13-day conflict, resulting in the creation of Bangladesh. Many believe that the world, especially the United States, was taken aback by her resolve, having underestimated her determination and believing their threats would deter her. Despite US pressure, it was reported that Gandhi remained steadfast, reshaping the region\u2019s geopolitical landscape and reinforcing India\u2019s independent foreign policy."

            "title": "Amritsar Hooch Tragedy: The Poison That Makes Fake Liquor So Deadly | Explained",
            "text": "The spectre of poisonous liquor has once again cast a deadly shadow over Punjab\u2019s Majha region after at least 15 people died from allegedly consuming spurious liquor in several villages of Amritsar\u2019s Majitha block. Officials warned that the toll is likely to rise in the coming days. The fatalities, reported from the villages of Bhangali Kalan, Thariwal, Sangha, and Marari Kalan, sent shockwaves through the local communities. Despite public outcry and promises of reform, illicit liquor continues to claim lives with alarming frequency. But what makes such liquor so dangerous? Why does a cheap drink, meant to offer momentary escape, end in agonising death? The term \u201ccountry liquor\", also known as Indian Made Indian Liquor (IMIL) or Desi Daru, often carries a cloud of suspicion, but there is a crucial distinction. Licensed country liquor, made under government supervision, is tested and taxed. In contrast, the toxic variant consumed in this tragedy is typically unlicensed, made in clandestine distilleries using hazardous substances. Known colloquially as kacchi sharab or raw liquor, it is often produced using a volatile mix of jaggery, water, and urea. To hasten fermentation, illegal brewers frequently add chemicals like oxytocin, ammonium chloride, and other industrial solvents. These additives are not only illegal but potentially lethal. One of the deadliest by-products of such crude brewing is \u201cmethyl alcohol\", also known as methanol \u2013 a chemical not meant for human consumption. Unlike ethyl alcohol, which is safe in moderation and forms the base of consumable spirits, methanol is a toxic solvent. In improper brewing setups, particularly where fermentation temperatures are not adequately controlled, methanol can form in large quantities. Experts warn that once methanol is ingested, it is metabolised into formaldehyde and formic acid \u2013 compounds that attack the optic nerves and central nervous system. Victims often first complain of nausea, dizziness, and blurred vision. In severe cases, this progresses to blindness, organ failure, and death. \u201cWhen methanol levels cross 90 percent in a mixture, it becomes poison,\" said a forensic toxicologist, adding that such high concentrations can lead to cardiomyopathy \u2013 where the heart muscle swells and weakens \u2013 and optic neuropathy, which damages the eyes irreversibly. Tragedies like these are often dismissed as accidents, but the recurrence suggests systemic failure. Illicit alcohol continues to circulate due to lax enforcement, porous regulation, and the economic desperation of the poor who seek cheaper alternatives to legal liquor. Sold for a fraction of the cost of regulated spirits, bootleg liquor remains a tempting risk for daily wage labourers and marginalised communities. Most of the hooch victims were from working-class backgrounds and are believed to have consumed the illicit brew on the same day, Sunday. Several others are reportedly undergoing treatment, some in critical condition. Local authorities have moved swiftly, with the Punjab government confirming the arrest of two primary suspects- identified as Prabhjit Singh and Sahib Singh \u2013 from Rajasansi. According to an official spokesperson, both men are believed to be key suppliers of the toxic liquor. In addition, four others who allegedly purchased the illicit alcohol from the duo and distributed it across villages have also been taken into custody. Two FIRs have been registered, and further investigations are underway. This latest tragedy is an unsettling reminder of the mass poisoning that shook the same region five years ago. In 2020, around 130 people lost their lives across Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur, and Amritsar districts after consuming tainted liquor \u2013 one of the deadliest hooch tragedies in recent memory. That disaster not only exposed a vast underground network of bootleggers but also laid bare the deadly consequences of unregulated alcohol production."

A day after his address to the nation on Operation Sindoor, PM Modi Modi travelled to the Adampur air base on Tuesday morning and interacted with air force personnel, who have been in the thick of action during the recent conflict with Pakistan. The Prime Minister shared four striking photos from his visit: one with airmen and a MiG-29 fighter jet, another addressing a gathering with the S-400 missile system in the background, a third conversing with smiling airmen, and a fourth speaking at a podium with a MiG-29 behind him. One of many strategic messages from the PM\u2019s visit was to show that Adampur Airbase, the forward airbase that Pakistan attempted to target using a missile on the night of May 9, is fully operational against Islamabad\u2019s claims that it suffered heavy damage. PM Modi\u2019s photo with S-400 also assumes significance as the air defence system thwarted drone and missile attacks launched by Pakistan while MiG-29 was also roped in Operation Sindoor. The nation became aware of the S-400\u2019s capabilities when the system shot down over 300 drones in a matter of hours on the night of 8 May. Sharing some more glimpses from my visit to AFS Adampur. pic.twitter.com/G9NmoAZvTR\u2014 Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) May 13, 2025 Modi said on X, \u201cEarlier this morning, I went to AFS Adampur and met our brave air warriors and soldiers. It was a very special experience to be with those who epitomise courage, determination and fearlessness. India is eternally grateful to our armed forces for everything they do for our nation.\" The prime minister\u2019s visit comes after days of intense conflict between India and Pakistan following Indian strikes on terror sites in the neighbouring country on May 7 under Operation Sindoor. India and Pakistan agreed on May 10 to stop military actions. India has, however, made it clear it has merely paused its operation and its future actions will be guided by Pakistan\u2019s conduct."

            "text": "The uneasy calm of Ranthambore Tiger Reserve in Rajasthan was shattered once again as a sub-adult tigress, reportedly the offspring of the famed T-84, fatally attacked a forest ranger near the historic Jogi Mahal. The incident, which took place on Sunday, May 11, ignited fresh concerns over growing human-wildlife conflict within the reserve and raised serious questions about the forest department\u2019s handling of rising aggression among young tigers. The victim, Devendra Chaudhary, a 40-year-old forest ranger, was on duty when he was ambushed by the tigress. According to a forest official cited by The Times of India, the animal \u201cgrabbed the ranger by the neck and dragged him inside the forest.\" Chaudhary was rushed to the district hospital but was declared dead on arrival. \u201cThis is the second death in a tiger attack within a month,\" a forest official official confirmed. \u201cChaudhary joined the forest department about 8 years ago, taking his late father\u2019s place as a forester. He was recently promoted to the ranger\u2019s post. He is survived by his wife and a one-and-a-half-year-old son,\" he said. The same sub-adult tigress, whose behaviour has become increasingly bold and aggressive, was earlier linked to the killing of a seven-year-old boy. These repeated attacks have turned the spotlight on the forest department\u2019s apparent lack of timely action. Despite growing signs of danger, no concrete intervention had been implemented to mitigate the threat posed by the young tigresses frequenting the tourist-heavy Jogi Mahal zone."

            "text": "The southwest monsoon advanced into parts of the south Bay of Bengal, south Andaman Sea, Nicobar Islands and some areas of the north Andaman Sea on Tuesday, the India Meteorological Department said. The weather department said moderate to heavy rainfall lashed Nicobar Islands in the past two days. The strength and depth of westerly winds over the south Bay of Bengal, Nicobar Islands and Andaman Sea increased in this period, with wind speeds exceeding 20 knots at 1.5 km above sea level and extending up to 4.5 km in some areas. The Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR), an indicator of cloudiness, also decreased over the region. These conditions met the criteria for the monsoon\u2019s onset over the region, it said. The weather office said conditions are favourable for the monsoon to advance further into more parts of the south Arabian Sea, Maldives and Comorin area; more areas of the south Bay of Bengal; the entire Andaman and Nicobar Islands; remaining parts of the Andaman Sea; and parts of the central Bay of Bengal over the next three to four days. The primary rain bearing system is likely to reach Kerala on May 27, earlier than the usual date of June 1. If the monsoon arrives in Kerala as expected, it will be the earliest onset over the Indian mainland since 2009, when it began on May 23, according to IMD data. Normally, the southwest monsoon makes its onset over Kerala by June 1 and covers the entire country by July 8. It starts retreating from northwest India around September 17 and withdraws completely by October 15. The IMD had, in April, forecast above-normal cumulative rainfall in the 2025 monsoon season, ruling out the possibility of El Ni\u00f1o conditions, which are associated with below-normal rainfall in the Indian subcontinent. The monsoon is crucial for India\u2019s agriculture sector, which supports the livelihood of about 42 per cent of the population and contributes about 18 per cent to the country\u2019s GDP. It is also vital for replenishing reservoirs critical for drinking water and power generation across the country."

            "text": "In the turbulent days following India\u2019s massive counter-terror offensive under Operation Sindoor, a name rarely heard beyond classified military circles began trending across global media \u2013 Kirana Hills. Tucked deep in Pakistan\u2018s Punjab province, this obscure location suddenly found itself at the centre of frenzied speculation, conspiracy theories, and strategic denials. It all began after India launched a blistering aerial strike in retaliation to Pakistan\u2019s failed missile and drone incursions across the border. Within three hours, the Indian Air Force (IAF) reportedly crippled 11 Pakistani airbases and destroyed nearly 20 percent of the infrastructure supporting the Pakistan Air Force (PAF). As images of wreckage and military briefings flooded news feeds, whispers on social media grew louder \u2013 had India struck Kirana Hills, the alleged heart of Pakistan\u2019s nuclear weapons program? Located in the Sargodha district of Punjab province in Pakistan, Kirana Hills has long been the subject of hushed conversations within military and intelligence communities. Often dubbed \u201cPakistan\u2019s Area 51\", the rocky hills are said to be riddled with underground tunnels and fortified bunkers, constructed in the 1980s. These reportedly house key elements of Pakistan\u2019s nuclear arsenal \u2013 warheads, delivery systems, and sensitive missile technologies. Amid mounting speculation, the Indian Air Force broke its silence. \u201cWe did not hit Kirana Hills,\" declared Air Marshal AK Bharti during a high-level press briefing on Monday, May 12. Addressing the rumours circulating across global media and defence communities, he said, \u201cThank you for telling us that Pakistan has stored its nuclear weapons at Kirana Hills, whatever is there. We did not hit Kirana Hills. It was not on the list of the targets we told you we hit.\" The statement, while dismissive of the conspiracy theories, underscored two things: first, that Kirana Hills is now accepted, at least informally, as a key node in Pakistan\u2019s nuclear infrastructure, and second, that India deliberately avoided targeting it, despite having the capability to do so. Neither Pakistan nor the US commented officially on the aircraft\u2019s presence. Pakistani defence officials, however, rejected the claims outright, stating that none of its nuclear facilities had been targeted or compromised. But the silence on the nature of Kirana Hills only fuelled further curiousity. Beyond the cloak-and-dagger appeal, Kirana Hills represents something more profound for Pakistan \u2013 a symbol of deterrence. Since the late 1990s, Pakistan\u2019s nuclear capability has served as a counterbalance to India\u2019s conventional military superiority. Analysts often refer to the doctrine of \u201cnuclear blackmail\" \u2013 the idea that Pakistan uses its atomic arsenal as a shield behind which it can support asymmetric warfare, including cross-border terrorism.

In probably one of his most straightforward addresses to the nation, PM Modi refused to take any credit but showered praise on India\u2019s tri-service, paramilitary, and scientific community for Operation Sindoor. But in this age of information warfare, where Pakistan has flooded the internet with doctored video to suggest it demolished India\u2019s prized S400 air defence system, or their prime minister\u2019s midnight press conference claiming \u201cvictory\", how does BJP plan to take Modi\u2019s message of \u201cIndia struck at the heart of Pakistan\"? On Monday, PM Modi reminded the world that he still believes it\u2019s not the age of war but \u201cneither is it the age of terror\". The prime minister, using the occasion of Buddha Poornima, sent out the message of peace but with a caveat: \u201cThe path of peace also goes through power\". But the problem lies with the language in which he spoke\u2014Hindi. According to the 2011 census, only 43.63 per cent of the people in India can speak Hindi. The southern and north-eastern states, apart from Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim, have a very low percentage of Hindi speakers. For instance, in Tamil Nadu only 2.3 per cent speak Hindi. So how will Modi\u2019s message reach them? The government used Artificial Intelligence and dubbed PM Modi\u2019s speech in 10 regional languages in an hour\u2019s time\u2014Telegu, Bengali, Gujarati, Assamese, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil, Punjabi, Kannada and Odia. They beamed the regional versions in respective Doordarshan channels and released on YouTube channels, garnering massive eyeballs and taking the message deep. If the government is taking Modi\u2019s message of \u201cWe have defeated Pakistan every time\" to the masses with multiple languages, the BJP isn\u2019t sitting idle either. The party now plans to hold a 10-day nationwide mass connect movement through which it plans to not just portray a brave face of the BJP-led Centre but will inevitably do a contrast of response between Congress-led UPA era and BJP-led NDA era. The movement will be called \u2018Tiranga Yatra\u2019, which is expected to kick off from May 13 and will continue till May 23. BJP will not just hold press conferences across major capitals, but its member of MPs, general secretaries, and even select Union ministers, will be asked to tour certain states where they will reach out to intellectuals, senior citizens, trader bodies, clubs among others, say sources. BJP\u2019s Yuva Morcha and Mahila Morcha will also be used during this \u2018Tiranga Yatra\u2019 where the goal will be to claim victory and credit PM Modi\u2019s leadership, while highlighting opposition statements that came across as tacitly supporting Pakistan. BJP will mount a social media campaign with regular multiple reels on Instagram targeting the youth, while the cadres will distribute leaflets highlighting, in bullet points, why Operation Sindoor is a \u2018gamechanger\u2019, a BJP source told News18. With Bihar election scheduled in the year-end, less than six months from now, one can expect BJP to become more aggressive in its narrative war in the coming days."

On May 10, Mufti had said India should embrace its leadership role in the subcontinent and take the first step to de-escalate tensions with Pakistan, as it is a moment for the country to stand tall and demonstrate that its true strength lies in its soft power and commitment to peace. Mufti\u2019s remarks came after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke to Pakistani Army chief Asif Munir, and \u201curged both parties to find ways to de-escalate\". \u201cThe world is watching us. This is the moment for India to stand tall and demonstrate that its true strength lies in its soft power and commitment to peace, not in nukes,\" Mufti added."

Although the state government recently amended the rules for selecting the DGP, reports suggest that no committee has been formed so far. It also remains unclear whether a panel will be sent to the Union Public Service Commission for the selection process. Among these names, strong contenders for the DGP position include Daljit Singh Chaudhary, Atul Sharma, and Rajiv Krishna. Currently, Daljit Singh Chaudhary is serving as the DG of BSF, while Alok Sharma heads the SPG, both having six months left until retirement. Rajiv Krishna, who chairs the Uttar Pradesh Police Recruitment and Promotion Board and serves as Director of Vigilance, has four years remaining before his retirement. Amid the upcoming change in leadership, the possibility of Uttar Pradesh getting its first woman DGP has gained attention. Tilottama Verma, currently serving as DG Training, has six months left in her tenure and is among the senior-most officers in contention. She brings extensive experience to the table, including a long stint with the CBI. Her husband, Ashish Gupta, also a UP cadre IPS officer and currently at the top of the seniority list, applied for voluntary retirement last month.

            "text": "A pall of grief descended over five villages near Majitha in Punjab\u2019s Amritsar district, where at least 15 people have died and several others remain hospitalised after consuming a batch of illicit, poisonous liquor believed to have originated from a single source. The tragedy unfolded across Bhangli, Patalpuri, Marari Kalan, Therewal, and Talwandi Ghuman \u2013 all within a few kilometres of one another \u2013 turning what should have been an ordinary Sunday evening into a nightmare. Families say the victims had gathered and purchased liquor from the same supplier, unaware that it would prove fatal within hours. By late Monday night, the death toll had climbed to 15, with six more villagers still undergoing treatment in hospital. Authorities fear the number could rise further as symptoms of toxic alcohol \u2013 often methanol poisoning \u2013 may take up to 48 hours to manifest. \u201cPeople began falling sick in different villages shortly after consuming the liquor,\" said Amritsar SSP Maninder Singh, who confirmed that the police were first alerted around 9:30 pm on Monday. By the time the police were fully informed, several people had already died, and some were even cremated before police could reach them, he further said. Initial investigations point to the liquor having been sold or distributed on Sunday. Villagers, many of them from economically weaker backgrounds, reportedly purchased the alcohol in hopes of enjoying a leisurely evening. What followed instead was a wave of vomiting, dizziness, and collapse. In many cases, death was swift and families had little time to respond. Eyewitnesses described scenes of panic as multiple homes suddenly became sites of tragedy. \u201cIt was like a curse swept through the villages,\" said one local resident, adding, \u201cPeople drank together, and then one by one they started dying. We didn\u2019t know what was happening.\""

            "text": "A the tensions between the two neighbouring countries escalated, most countries around the world condemned terrorism and expressed their support for India. However, a few hostile nations, including Turkey, sided with Pakistan. Following this, a massive call of \u2018boycott Turkey\u2019 was witnessed across the country with many platforms, including Ixigo, EaseMyTrip, suspending all flight and hotel bookings for Turkey. The call for a boycott of Turkey intensified after Indian traders started boycotting Turkish apples. Consequently, Turkish apples have vanished from the market, leading to a rise in apple prices from Iran. Wholesale prices for 10 kg of apples have increased by Rs 200 to 300, while retail prices have risen by Rs 20 to 30 per kg. Due to Turkey\u2019s support for Pakistan, Indian traders have become more assertive. They now prefer apples from Iran, Washington, and New Zealand over Turkish apples. Apples are sourced both domestically and internationally, and the India-Pakistan tension has also affected international apple trade. The ongoing tension between India and Pakistan has disrupted the arrival of apples from Kashmir, which are stored in Controlled Atmosphere Technology Chambers and usually available in the market even after the season ends."

            "text": "India is treading a fine line with the United States (US) with regard to Operation Sindoor, amid the Opposition picking up Donald Trump\u2019s remarks to target the government. Without naming the US, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the nation on Monday, made it clear that no third party had influenced India\u2019s decision to pause hostilities with Pakistan since May 10. Trump had announced the \u2018ceasefire\u2019 between India and Pakistan on May 10, even before India and Pakistan could declare so. Then on Monday, just before Modi\u2019s address to the nation, Trump said he had told India and Pakistan that there would be no trade with them if they don\u2019t stop hostilities. Government sources, however, were quick to counter, pointing out that Trump and the US found no mention in the PM\u2019s address. In fact, top sources also rubbished Trump\u2019s claims saying trade had found no mention in the three calls that the US had made to India on May 9 and May 10 before the hostilities were paused. US Vice-President J D Vance had spoken to the PM on May 9, while US Secretary of state Marco Rubio spoke to External Affairs Ministers S Jaishankar as well as National Security Adviser on May 10. India has been categorical that in no conversation did the US mention the trade aspect and only asked for de-escalation. Modi, in fact, was unmoved by the call by Vance on May 9, telling the US V-P that he won\u2019t offer any off-ramp to Pakistan, and promised a devastating response to Pakistan if it continues to act against India. India did so on May 10 morning by attacking a dozen air bases of Pakistan with missiles. Jaishankar\u2019s response to Rubio was similar, after Rubio said that Pakistan Army chief Asim Munir had told him he was ready to stop military action. Rubio was told by Jaishankar as well as Doval to \u201clet Pakistan DGMO say so directly to India\", and not through the US. \u201cAfter India\u2019s aggressive action, Pakistan started looking for ways to escape. Pakistan was pleading to the world to ease tensions. After suffering heavy losses, Pakistan\u2019s army contacted our DGMO on the afternoon of May 10. When Pakistan appealed and said that it will not indulge in any sort of terror activities or military audacity further, India considered it,\" the PM said in his address, discounting the US role. Trump\u2019s offer to mediate on Kashmir was also rebuffed by Modi without naming the US. \u201cThe only talk with Pakistan will be on terror and PoK,\" Modi announced."

            "text": "India\u2019s robust, multi-layered air defence system successfully intercepted Pakistan\u2019s attempted drone and missile attacks following Operation Sindoor, before a ceasefire came into effect on May 10. News18 breaks down the country\u2019s formidable four-tier air defence system, one of the most critical pillars of India\u2019s national security. India\u2019s multi-layered air defence network is built to detect, track, and neutralise aerial threats at multiple ranges, forming a strong shield against enemy attacks. During the recent threat from Pakistan, the Indian Air Force\u2019s Integrated Air Command and Control System (IACCS) deployed a potent mix of Russian S-400 Triumph systems, indigenous Akash and Samar missiles, Barak-8 medium-range surface-to-air missiles and advanced anti-drone systems. First Layer: The innermost layer is dedicated to neutralising very short-range aerial threats, such as low-flying drones. It includes systems like the L-70 anti-aircraft guns, Igla and Strela MANPADS, ZU-23-2B guns, Shilka and Tunguska. These are effective within a range of up to 10 km. Second Layer: The second layer, known as the point defence system, is tasked with protecting specific areas or critical assets. This layer consists of short-range surface-to-air missile systems such as Akash, Spyder, Samar, Pechora and Osa-AK with interception capabilities of up to 50 km. Third Layer: The third tier is equipped with medium-range missiles, including the indigenous Akash system and the Indo-Israeli Medium-Range Surface-to-Air Missile (MRSAM). These are designed to intercept threats at greater distances. This tier comprises missile systems like Barak and Rakshak, capable of targeting aerial threats at distances of up to 100 km. Fourth Layer: The outermost and longest-range tier features the Russian-made S-400 Triumph system, which can detect and destroy threats as far as 400 km away. It can intercept enemy aircraft and missiles far before they reach Indian airspace. In this multi-layered air defence grid, older but reliable systems like the Pechora, Osa-AK and air defence guns played a crucial role. Air Force officer Awadhesh Kumar Bharti said, \u201cThis air defence system neutralised every aerial threat from the enemy. The performance of the indigenous Akash missile system, in particular, was highly commendable.\" According to reports, Indian air defence units successfully intercepted and destroyed a range of threats, including Chinese PL-15 missiles, long-range rockets, loitering munitions and Turkish-made drones. Meanwhile, the Indian Navy played a key role in securing the maritime front. Vice Admiral AN Pramod, Director General Operations, said the deployment of aircraft carriers and MiG-29K fighter jets near the Makran coast in the Arabian Sea effectively curbed Pakistani air activity in the region, ensuring there was no threat from the sea."

Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (DG-ISPR) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif said at a press briefing on Sunday that Islam was not just integral to the faith of individual soldiers but was part of the army\u2019s training. His response came when a journalist asked him if the name of Pakistan army\u2019s operation, \u2018Bunyanum Marsoos\u2019, and early morning attacks on Indian civilians and military establishments were guided by the path shown by Allah. The question and the reply are not surprising though as the Pakistan army has always openly embraced its Islamic foundation, proudly displaying the motto \u2018Iman, Taqwa, Jihad fiSabilillah\u2019 (faith, piety, struggle in the name of God). On Pakistan army naming its operation \u2018Bunyanum Marsoos\u2019, he said those who fight for Allah are like a \u201csteel wall\"."

            "text": "India\u2019s Operation Sindoor and Pakistan\u2019s futile attempts to escalate tensions by using drones and missiles against India have once again exposed the critical vulnerabilities in Pakistan\u2019s defence infrastructure which has become dependent on Chinese military hardware. A glaring issue is the ineffectiveness of Chinese air defence systems against stealth and precision attacks. The HQ-9B, marketed as a Patriot equivalent, and the HQ-16, failed to intercept Indian SCALP stealth cruise missiles and HAMMER glide bombs. These systems struggle with detecting low-altitude, terrain-hugging threats due to limited detection ranges and susceptibility to jamming. Pakistan\u2019s air defence also lacks redundancy and layered coordination, which Indian SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses) tactics exploited by targeting radar nodes, crippling the entire network. Additionally, Pakistan\u2019s fighter jets, reliant on pre-programmed flight paths, are outmatched by Indian technology, making them predictable targets. A significant 81 per cent of Pakistan\u2019s arms imports come from China, creating a dependency without diversification. China\u2019s refusal to share cutting-edge technology, such as the J-20 stealth fighters, has left Pakistan with outdated systems, while India\u2019s mix of Russian, Western, and homegrown technology has reduced its dependency risks and enhanced adaptability. Sources indicate that Chinese systems sold to Pakistan are downgraded. For instance, the HQ-9P has a 125 km range compared to China\u2019s domestic HQ-9B, which has a range of 250-300 km. A Pakistani LY-80 radar system in Gujranwala was destroyed by Indian Harop loitering munitions due to poor mobility and counter-drone capabilities. The JF-17\u2019s KLJ-7A AESA radar has a smaller aperture than India\u2019s Rafale\u2019s RBE2-AA radar, reducing detection range and tracking accuracy. Limited fuel capacity restricts operational range, forcing reliance on vulnerable mid-air refueling. Exported PL-15E missiles have a reduced range (145 km) compared to China\u2019s domestic PL-15 (200-300 km), allowing India\u2019s Rafales with Meteor missiles (200 km) to outrange them. Chinese Wing Loong II and CH-4 drones were easily intercepted by India\u2019s Akash SAMs and SMASH-2000 counter-drone systems due to poor maneuverability and lack of stealth features. To add to woes, Pakistan\u2019s limited defence budget ($10.2 billion vs. India\u2019s $86 billion) has led to maintenance shortfalls. Defective Wing Loong drones reportedly crashed during missions, and the lack of specialised technicians in Pakistan caused downtime during critical operations. Pakistani pilots, trained on simulators, struggled with real-world combat scenarios, unlike India\u2019s Rafale pilots who trained in France. The operational inflexibility and integration flaws of Chinese arms exports to Pakistan, despite their cost-effectiveness, falter against India\u2019s technologically superior, diversified, and well-integrated defence architecture."

            "title": "What If A Supersonic Missile Hits A Nuclear Weapons Storage Facility? | Explained",
            "text": "In a scenario that remains purely hypothetical but has sparked considerable curiosity amid the India-Pakistan conflict, questions arise about the potential impact of a supersonic cruise missile striking a nuclear weapon storage facility. While no such incident has ever occurred, News18 explores whether such an attack could trigger a nuclear explosion, cause the release of radioactive material or lead to other catastrophic consequences. Nuclear weapons are stored in highly secure, hardened underground bunkers or Special Weapons Storage Areas (SWSA). These facilities feature thick walls, often four to five meters thick, and blast-proof doors. They are built deep underground with multiple layers of security. Key security measures include: Reinforced Storage: Each nuclear weapon is stored in a reinforced, steel-lined vault. Underground Facility in Balochistan: An underground complex in this region has been identified as a possible storage site for missiles and nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are typically stored in highly secure facilities known as Hardened Underground Bunkers or Special Weapons Storage Areas (SWSA). Even if a high-explosive missile were to strike such a site, it would not trigger a nuclear explosion. This is because nuclear bombs cannot be detonated by a conventional explosion alone. Their activation requires a precise sequence of electronic commands and secure detonation codes. Multiple layers of safety interlocks are in place to prevent accidental or unauthorized detonation. As a result, even in the event of a direct missile hit, the most likely outcomes would be structural damage and a potential radioactive leak, not a nuclear blast. If a missile strike is forceful enough to breach the protective casing of a nuclear weapon and release its radioactive material, the impact could resemble that of a \u2018dirty bomb\u2019. In such a scenario, the surrounding area would become contaminated with radioactive particles, posing serious long-term health risks to humans and causing environmental damage. Immediate evacuation of the area would be necessary. If a nuclear storage site is targeted with a high-penetration bunker buster or a thermobaric weapon\u2014designed to explode deep underground it could cause significant structural damage and increase the risk of radioactive leakage and contamination. However, even in such a case, a nuclear explosion would not occur. This is precisely why storage facilities around the world are built at great depths and with multiple layers of protection to withstand such high-impact attacks. Control Of Nuclear Assets: It manages all nuclear weapons, including their associated delivery systems such as missiles, bombers, and submarines. Security And Storage: Ensures nuclear weapons are stored in secure locations, maintaining their safety and readiness for deployment during a threat. Soviet Union (1986): In Severomorsk, a fire broke out in a nuclear missile storage facility, accidentally destroying 16 missiles that were carrying nuclear warheads. While no nuclear explosion occurred, the fire caused significant damage to the facility and resulted in radioactive leakage."

            "text": "Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Monday expressed disappointment at US President Donald Trump\u2019s post on the announcement of halting military hostilities between India and Pakistan, saying, the narrative offers Pakistan a negotiating framework which it certainly has not earned. Tharoor also opined that Trump making such an announcement \u201cis disappointing for India in four important ways\", as it \u201cinternationalises\" the Kashmir dispute, which is an obvious objective of the terrorists. India has never requested, nor is likely to seek, any foreign country\u2019s mediation over its problems with Pakistan, the Congress leader said. \u201cMr Trump\u2019s post is disappointing for India in four important ways,\" Tharoor wrote on X. \u201cSecond, it offers Pakistan a negotiating framework which it certainly has not earned. India will never negotiate with a terrorist gun pointed at its head,\" he wrote. \u201cThird, it \u201cinternationalises\" the Kashmir dispute, an obvious objective of the terrorists. India rejects the idea of a dispute and sees the problem as an internal affair of India\u2019s. India has never requested, not is likely to seek, any foreign country\u2019s mediation over its problems with Pakistan,\" Tharoor wrote. \u201cFor decades now, world leaders had been encouraged not to club their visits to India with visits to Pakistan, and starting with President Clinton in 2000, no US President had done so. This is a major backward step,\" Shashi Tharoor further wrote on X. The decision by India and Pakistan was first made public by Trump in a social media post, wherein he claimed that the talks between the two sides were mediated by the United States. Tharoor also pointed out that the US President tried to make a \u201cfalse equivalence\" between India and Pakistan and said it was equating the victim with the perpetrator, which was \u201cshocking\". \u201cI see it as a particular politician wanting to take credit for something and I can see that the government of India probably said \u2018let them take the credit if they want to\u2019, but from our point of view we have made it clear that the peace followed a request from the DGMO of Pakistan who called his Indian counterpart at 3.35 pm (Saturday) and we did not take very long to say yes because we had never wanted a long war,\" Tharoor said. Tharoor also said the tension between India and Pakistan is not new. \u201cSo, if you look back at where things stood even before Pahalgam, it was not a very warm relationship. After Pahalgam, it\u2019s taken a further dive \u2014 because, as you know, we\u2019ve suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, we have reduced the number of personnel in the embassy here, in the High Commission, we have removed defence attaches,\" he said. It is a very tense relationship even without a shooting war going on, Tharoor said."

From the pressure cooker of Doklam to the icy choke of Galwan, from handling Pahalgam\u2019s pain to parrying Pakistan\u2019s propaganda\u2014Vikram Misri has always been India\u2019s quiet crisis manager. Now, as the foreign secretary, he faces a different battlefield\u2014social media slander, communal jibes, and multiple fabricated whispers about his loyalty. But Misri isn\u2019t flinching. No statement. No outrage. No cry for sympathy. Just a private X account and a steady hand on India\u2019s foreign policy wheel. Misri\u2019s diplomatic service is marked by critical and crucial postings, including Ambassador to China during the Doklam and Galwan crises. Over the past 24 hours, Misri suddenly finds himself under an unexpected barrage\u2014not from global adversaries but from domestic trolls as they blame and abuse him for the \u201cceasefire\". The attacks were vicious, mostly anonymous, and sometimes communal\u2014ignoring his years of service in the PMO under PM Modi, or his critical tenure as Ambassador to China during Doklam and Galwan. He and his family faced a wave of social media abuse, questioning his loyalties. Misri, true to his form and dignity, responded not with noise but restraint\u2014simply making his X account private while continuing his work with quiet resolve. As noise escalated online, the real India\u2014its steel frame of governance\u2014stood firmly with him. Senior diplomats, his peers and batchmates from across services, IAS and IPS associations, political leaders across parties, and foreign policy veterans issued open endorsements of Misri\u2019s work ethic and credibility, debunking the social media narrative built against him. In a statement, the IAS association said, \u201cThe IAS Association stands in solidarity with Shri Vikram Misri, Foreign Secretary, and his family. Unwarranted personal attacks on civil servants performing their duties with integrity are deeply regrettable. We reaffirm our commitment to uphold the dignity of public service.\" In a similar statement, the IPS association said, \u201cWe unequivocally condemn the deplorable personal attacks against Foreign Secretary Shri Vikram Misri and his family. Such unwarranted assaults on civil servants committed to their duties are absolutely intolerable. We commend his unwavering service to the nation and reaffirm our resolute commitment to safeguarding the dignity of public service.\" A career diplomat of 1989 IFS batch and with nearly four decades of experience, Misri\u2019s journey reflects quiet continuity\u2014across governments, geographies, and multiple geopolitical crises. Appointed India\u2019s 35th foreign secretary in 2024, Misri stepped into the role in the middle of the rising diplomatic stakes and turbulent geo-political winds. \u201cYou don\u2019t measure a diplomat by hashtags,\" said a senior IFS officer who worked with Misri. \u201cYou measure him by what the world hears and doesn\u2019t. It is just because of his work. He stands tall literally as one of the sharp and erudite foreign service officers the country has got,\" added the senior officer. Misri\u2019s career is built not on headline moments but on inflection points, which include crisis negotiations, boundary diplomacy, several discreet backchannel dialogues, and tireless but powerful briefings in corridors of power. He was in the room when the Gujral doctrine took shape. He drafted cables during the Indo-US nuclear thaw. And he was at the centre of India\u2019s most delicate bilateral relationship with China, as India\u2019s ambassador, during its most hostile phase. In many ways, Misri is emblematic of a vanishing kind of civil service officer who absorbs pressure, speaks less, and delivers more, said his batchmate, and a senior IPS officer. \u201cHis silence in the face of slander is not his weakness, it is his discipline and resilience that taught the officers to follow protocol,\" he added."

            "text": "Days after India struck terror camps in Pakistan under \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019, as many as 17 newborns in Uttar Pradesh have been named after India\u2019s strike to avenge the Pahalgam terror attack. Newborns, mostly girls, in UP\u2019s Kushinagar district have been named \u2018Sindoor\u2019 by their families, as a tribute to India\u2019s military actions against terrorist hideouts in Pakistan. Most of these newborns were born on May 9 and 10, while the \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019 was carried out on May 7, days after armed terrorists killed 26 tourists in Kashmir\u2019s iconic Pahalgam. \u201cMy baby was born on May 9, two days after our brave soldiers avenged the Pahalgam attack. While I empathise with the pain of the bereaved families, I also wish to thank the brave soldiers who guard our borders. So, I have named my daughter \u2018Sindoor\u2019 as a tribute to them,\" TOI quoted Neha Gupta, a resident of Kushinagar as saying. The name \u2018Sindoor\u2019, which refers to the red vermilion worn by married Hindu women, has now come to symbolise sacrifice, strength, and national unity, especially for the women who lost their husbands in the recent terror attack. Madan Gupta, a resident of Padrauna town in Kushinagar district of Uttar Pradesh, became a proud grandfather when his daughter-in-law gave birth to a baby girl. Around the same time, the Indian Army launched \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019, delivering a strong response to Pakistan and forcing them to retreat. Inspired by the success of this operation and filled with patriotic emotion, Gupta shared that they decided to name their granddaughter \u2018Sindoor\u2019 in honour of the Indian Army and have dedicated her to the nation. Kajal, the baby\u2019s mother, said that during the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, many women lost their husbands and had the sindoor (vermilion) wiped off their foreheads by terrorism. But through \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019, the Indian Army destroyed terrorist hideouts and sent the attackers to hell, which made every Indian proud. She added, \u201cThis name \u2018Sindoor\u2019 is not just a word, it\u2019s an emotion. That\u2019s why we decided to name our daughter Sindoor.\" Neha, a resident of Khanwar Baklolhi village under Padrauna Tehsil, also gave birth to a baby girl on May 9. Inspired by the same operation, she too named her daughter \u2018Sindoor\u2019. Neha said, \u201cThe way our soldiers gave a befitting reply to Pakistan, I decided to name my daughter \u2018Sindoor\u2019 in their honour.\" Another family from the village of Bhathhi Babu in Kushinagar, where Vyas Muni\u2019s wife gave birth to a daughter, also chose to name her \u2018Sindoor\u2019. Indian armed forces carried out \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019 from 01.05 am to 01.30 am on May 7, striking nine terror targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir. Later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi directed the armed forces that India\u2019s retaliation to any action by the Pakistani military should be bigger and stronger. India also briefed top countries on \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019, saying no civilian, economic or military targets were chosen."

            "text": "Maharashtra Cyber has identified seven Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups responsible for launching over 15 lakh cyber attacks targeting critical infrastructure websites across India following the Pahalgam terror strike. Even after India and Pakistan reached an understanding to stop military hostilities, Indian government websites are facing a barrage of cyber attacks from the neighbouring country as well as from Bangladesh and the Middle Eastern region, they said. Addressing reporters, a senior official of Maharashtra Cyber debunked claims of hackers stealing data from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport in Mumbai, hacking aviation and municipal systems, and targeting the Election Commission website. \u201cThe probe discovered that cyber attacks on (government websites in) India decreased after India-Pakistan ceased hostilities, but not fully stopped. These attacks continue from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Morocco, and Middle Eastern countries,\" he said. In a report titled \u201cRoad of Sindoor\", prepared under the military operation launched by the Indian armed forces under the same name against terrorists, the state\u2019s nodal cyber agency has detailed the cyber warfare launched by Pakistan-allied hacking groups. According to the report, these cyber attacks originated from Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Middle East, and an Indonesian group, said Yashasvi Yadav, Additional Director General of Police, Maharashtra Cyber. The methods used included malware campaigns, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, and GPS spoofing. The defacement of Indian websites was also reported. \u201cRoad of Sindoor\" is a follow-up to Maharashtra Cyber\u2019s earlier report, \u201cEchoes of Pahalgam\", which documented cyber attacks following the Pahalgam terror incident. These groups collectively launched approximately 1.5 million targeted cyber attacks on Indian infrastructure, Yadav said. Among the 150 successful attacks, the Kulgaon Badlapur Municipal Council website was defaced. The attackers also claimed to have stolen data from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA), as well as from telecom companies, with some of the data allegedly appearing on the darknet. The report also highlights a hybrid warfare strategy by Pakistan-allied groups that includes widespread misinformation campaigns. These groups falsely claimed to have hacked India\u2019s banking system and caused power outages. Maharashtra Cyber identified and removed over 5,000 instances of misinformation and fake news related to India-Pakistan military conflicts that were circulating on social media. These false narratives included claims of cyber attacks on India\u2019s power grid, statewide blackouts, satellite jamming, disruption of the Northern Command, and an alleged attack on a BrahMos missile storage facility, Yadav said."

            "text": "Two cutting-edge drones developed by IIT Kanpur are set to undergo final trials on May 25, potentially becoming a vital addition to the Indian Army\u2019s growing UAV arsenal. Amid a military standoff between India and Pakistan following Operation Sindoor, the strategic importance of indigenous drone technology has never been more apparent. The two drones \u2013 FPV (First Person View) combat drone and a high-payload logistics drone \u2013 have been designed to meet the evolving demands of modern warfare and could soon be deployed for active operations. What set this operation apart was the extensive deployment of drones for both reconnaissance and precision targeting. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) provided real-time intelligence, tracked militant movement, and guided strikes with surgical accuracy, minimising collateral damage. The operation signalled a clear shift towards drone-led warfare, where aerial autonomy, stealth, and surveillance became decisive battlefield tools. The ministry of defence has since directed all drone-developing institutions and companies to present their most advanced prototypes for urgent consideration. IIT Kanpur\u2019s scientists and engineers have rapidly developed two specialised drone models. The first is a short-range FPV drone designed for precision strikes and real-time battlefield reconnaissance. The second is a heavy-lift drone capable of transporting logistics \u2013 ammunition, rations, or medical supplies \u2013 across rugged or inaccessible terrain. Both are equipped with stealth features and radar-evasive capabilities, making them ideal for deployment in hostile zones. \u201cThese drones are a direct response to a formal request from the Indian Army, given the evolving security environment. We are aiming for high-impact performance in both tactical and logistic dimensions. The May 25 trials will be crucial,\" said Prof Abhishek from IIT Kanpur\u2019s aerospace engineering department, which played a crucial role in developing the drones. FPV Combat Drone: This drone is a high-speed, low-altitude tactical UAV built for offensive roles in close-range engagements. Weighing under 10 kg, it features a compact frame, ultra-fast motor, and front-mounted high-definition camera capable of transmitting real-time video to ground controllers. It is designed for \u201ckamikaze\" missions as well as precision-targeted payload delivery. The drone can fly at speeds up to 120 kmph and has a flight endurance of up to 30 minutes. Equipped with GPS-denied navigation capabilities and visual-inertial odometry, it can operate in jammed or signal-compromised environments. It is also designed to fly through narrow urban or mountainous paths with enhanced obstacle avoidance algorithms, making it highly effective in surgical strike-type operations and enemy base infiltration. IIT Kanpur has previously supplied around 30 drones to the Indian Army, some of which are reportedly in service in the northeastern sectors. While operational details remain confidential, experts said these units have demonstrated strong performance in surveillance, terrain mapping, and limited combat roles. The new drones are expected to be more agile, autonomous, and mission-adaptive."

            "text": "Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Monday expressed his disappointment over US President Donald Trump\u2019s recent comments regarding the India-Pakistan ceasefire. Tharoor highlighted four key concerns with Trump\u2019s statement, which he believes undermines India\u2019s position on the issue. Firstly, Tharoor argued that Trump\u2019s statement creates a false equivalence between India, the victim, and Pakistan, the perpetrator. He pointed out that the US has historically maintained a firm stance against Pakistan\u2019s documented support for cross-border terrorism, and Trump\u2019s remarks appeared to overlook this history. \u201cMr Trump\u2019s post is disappointing for India in four important ways: First, it implies a false equivalence between the victim and the perpetrator, and seemingly overlooks the US\u2019 own past unwavering stance against Pakistan\u2019s well-documented links to cross-border terrorism,\" Tharoor said. Secondly, Tharoor took issue with Trump offering Pakistan a negotiating platform that it does not deserve. He emphasized that India would never negotiate with Pakistan under the threat of terrorism, reaffirming India\u2019s firm stand against any form of coercion in talks. \u201cSecond, it offers Pakistan a negotiating framework which it certainly has not earned. India will never negotiate with a terrorist gun pointed at its head,\" the Kerala Congressman said. Donald Trump had sought credit for brokering the ceasefire while India said that talks were held at a bilateral level. Trump had indicated that there is an \u201cissue\" with regard to the Kashmir region and that it had gone on for \u201cthousands of years\", disregarding the fact that Pakistan has sought to destabilize the Kashmir valley since the Partition of India in 1947. Tharoor, in response, condemned Trump\u2019s remarks for \u201cinternationalizing\" the Kashmir dispute, an outcome that aligns with the aims of terrorists seeking global attention. India has consistently rejected the notion of Kashmir being an international dispute, viewing it instead as an internal matter. \u201cThird, it \u201cinternationalises\" the Kashmir dispute, an obvious objective of the terrorists. India rejects the idea of a dispute and sees the problem as an internal affair of India\u2019s. India has never requested, not is likely to seek, any foreign country\u2019s mediation over its problems with Pakistan,\" the Lok Sabha MP from Thiruvananthapuram said. Finally, Tharoor criticized Trump for \u201cre-hyphenating\" India and Pakistan, reversing decades of diplomatic efforts. He noted that since 2000, US Presidents had been discouraged from visiting both countries on the same trip, with President Clinton being the last to do so. Tharoor sees Trump\u2019s comments as a major step backward in this regard. \u201cAnd fourth, it \u201cre-hyphenates\" India and Pakistan in the global imagination. For decades now, world leaders had been encouraged not to club their visits to India with visits to Pakistan, and starting with President Clinton in 2000, no US President had done so. This is a major backward step,\" Tharoor posted on X. In his statement, Trump had praised the leadership of both India and Pakistan for their \u201cunwavering\" stance and claimed that the US played a significant role in facilitating the ceasefire, suggesting that trade negotiations were a factor in the decision to de-escalate."

            "text": "In a rousing address to the nation after Operation Sindoor, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stated a new normal\u2014India will answer back, nuclear blackmail won\u2019t work, and India will see no difference between terrorists and governments who patronise them whoever they are and wherever they are. He pointed to the presence of Pakistan army officials at the funeral of terrorists to say Pakistan does state-sponsored terror. Modi also made it clear that it was Pakistan than came begging for peace after bearing the brunt of the Indian onslaught, forcing their DGMO to reach out to their counterpart in India. He made no mention of the US or its claims of a \u201cUS-brokered ceasefire\". Modi also did not rule out further action on Pakistani sponsored terror, makes it clear that even now, every inch of land in which terror is encouraged by Pakistan is within the reach of our Armed Forces. Modi clearly said Operation Sindoor was not over, saying India had only paused its operations and was keeping an eye on Pakistan\u2019s behaviour. He said any talks with Pakistan will only be on issues of ending terror, and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir. The PM also confirmed that the targets of the Indian Armed Forces have crossed a century, and that Pakistan has been repaid in a language that they understand. Modi exposes the hollowness of the Pakistani Army, which is nothing compared to the Indian Armed Forces. Modi called out the entire terror apparatus of Pakistan, calls Bahawalpur and Muridke as \u201cUniversities of Terror\". Modi dedicated the success of Operation Sindoor to India\u2019s Nari Shakti and said several women and children saw family members being butchered in the most cold-blooded manner by the terrorists. \u201cPakistan tried to remove the Sindoor of our women, we uprooted their universities of terror itself,\" the Prime Minister said. \u201cFor peace, India needs to be strong. When the need be, using this power is also important. We have done this through Op Sindoor,\" the PM said. The Prime Minister further stated that Pakistan army and Pakistan government is fuelling terrorism and this will one day will end Pakistan itself. \u201cPakistan must end its terror infrastructure \u2013 or there is no road to peace,\" Modi said. He said this was not an era of war, as his famous advice to the world, but said that this age is not of terrorism too. \u201cThere need to be zero tolerance for terror \u2013 this is a guarantee for a better world,\" the Prime Minister said. Modi made it clear that neither terror and talks cannot happen together, nor terror and trade. He also said blood and water cannot flow together, indicating that the Indus Water Treaty will continue to be on hold till Pakistan acts against terror on its soil. Modi said Operation Sindoor had drawn a new line. \u201cWe will give a befitting reply to any act of terror. We will act in our own way and on our own conditions. We will act at the roots of terror. No nuclear blackmail will be tolerated by India. Terror under nuclear blackmail will be strongly responded,\" he said. Modi saluted the Indian armed forces, the intelligence agencies, and the country\u2019s scientists, who he said showed great bravery. He said the Pahalgam attack was an attempt to break communal harmony of India. \u201cFor me personally, this was a big pain. The whole country, all parties, wanted a tough action against terror. I gave forces complete freedom to wipe out terror. Every terrorist, every terror group now knows that it means to wipe sindoor of our women. Operation Sindoor was not just a name, it reflected emotion of people. Operation Sindoor is a vow of justice. On 6 May late night, the whole world saw the vow turn into a result as Indian forces struck in Pakistan at terror centres,\" the PM said. Modi said terrorists had never thought in their dreams that India can take such a big step. \u201cWhen country is one, nation first is the emotion, then big decisions are taken. And results come. When India struck missiles at terror bases, then terror groups were shocked\u2026their confidence was shattered, not just their buildings,\" Modi said. He said Muridke and Bahawalpur were \u201cGlobal terror universities\" and were connected to multiple terror attacks, from 9/11, London tube bombings, or earlier big attacks in India. \u201cIndia destroyed these terror headquarters. Over 100 dreaded terrorists were killed. Many of them were openly roaming in Pakistan for decades. We finished them in one strike,\" the PM said. He said the action by India sent Pakistan into despair and left it rattled, which led Pakistan to do another misadventure and start attacking India instead of helping India strike at terror. \u201cBut Pakistan was exposed in this. The world saw how Pakistan drones and missiles were destroyed like a straw. Our air defence systems destroyed them in the sky. We attacked Pakistan\u2019s heart. Our drones and missiles hit Pakistan\u2019s air bases and damaged them. Pakistan had a lot of pride in them. We destroyed Pakistan so much that it has never imagined,\" the Prime Minister said. Modi made it clear that it was due to India\u2019s strikes that \u201cPakistan started to find ways to save itself and started going to the world after being totally pummelled by India\". He said this led to Pakistan DGMO contact India. \u201cBy then, we destroyed Pakistan terror infrastructure. When Pakistan appealed for saying it will not strike further, we considered it. We destroyed their terror and military installations \u2013 we have only suspended our action We will watch their every step and test their behaviour Our three forces and our air force and our navy \u2013 our border security force, we are on full alert,\" the PM said. Modi said India had always defeated Pakistan in wars. \u201cOperation Sindoor has added a new chapter \u2013 we have shown our capacity. In new age warfare \u2013 we have shown our superiority. Made-In-India weapons have proved to be superb,\" the PM said."

Therefore, when Pakistan said that it would not show any further terrorist activity and military audacity, India also considered it\u2026\" He sternly warned Pakistan that India will not succumb to nuclear blackmail and sent a clear message to the world: terror and trade, terror and talks cannot go together. \u201cOperation Sindoor is India\u2019s new policy against terrorism.

The Prime Minister also had an advice for Pakistan\u2019s rulers. \u201cThe terrorists they have been feeding and nurturing all these years will swallow Pakistan itself. If Pakistan wants to survive, it will have to root out terrorism. This is not an era of war, but this is also not the era of terror,\" he said. He further said Operation Sindoor was not just a name but, through it, the whole world saw India\u2019s resolve turn into action and more than 100 dreaded terrorists were slaughtered. \u201cPakistan has to dismantle its terror infrastructure. There is no other way to peace\u2026 When our missiles and drones destroyed terror sites in Pakistan, not only their buildings but their spirit was also demolished. When \u2018Nation First\u2019 is our resolve, steely decisions are taken,\" he added. Pakistan slumped into gloom after the Indian attack on terror camps but they dared to attack us rather than helping fight terrorism, Modi said. \u201cThe entire world saw how Pakistani drones were downed by our military might. India has struck at the heart of Pakistan, our missiles attacked with precision to damage their air bases,\" he added."

Terrorist bases like Bahawalpur and Muridke have been universities of global terrorism. Any major terrorist attack anywhere in the world, be it 9/11, London Tube bombings or any other major terrorist attack in India in the past few decades, has been linked to these terror bases. The terrorists had wiped off the vermilion of our sisters, so India destroyed these terror headquarters. More than 100 dreaded terrorists have been killed in these attacks by India. Many terror bosses were roaming freely in Pakistan for the last two-and-a-half to three decades, those who used to conspire against India, India has finished them off in one go.\" \u201cPakistan was deeply disappointed, frustrated and bewildered by India\u2019s action. In this bewilderment, it committed another audacity. Instead of supporting India\u2019s action against terrorism, Pakistan started attacking India. Pakistan targeted our schools, colleges, gurudwaras, temples, homes of ordinary citizens, Pakistan targeted our military bases, but in this, too, Pakistan got exposed. The world saw how Pakistan\u2019s drones and missiles were scattered like straws in front of India. India\u2019s strong air defence system destroyed them in the sky itself. Pakistan had prepared to attack on the border, but India attacked Pakistan on its heart. India\u2019s drones and missiles attacked with precision. India damaged those airbases of the Pakistani Air Force, which Pakistan took pride in. The destruction caused by India in the first three days was unimaginable for Pakistan,\" said the PM. #Watch | In his national address, PM Modi honored the courage of India\u2019s armed forces, dedicating their bravery to every mother, sister, and daughter, symbolizing the nation\u2019s collective strength and sacrifice.#IndiaPakistanConflict #OperationSindoor #PMModi pic.twitter.com/Ff728HMC4H\u2014 News18 (@CNNnews18) May 12, 2025 \u201cAfter India\u2019s aggressive action, Pakistan started looking for ways to escape. Pakistan was pleading the world to reduce tensions. After being beaten badly, it was under this compulsion. The Pakistani army contacted our DGMO on the afternoon of May 10. By then we had destroyed the terrorism infrastructure on a large scale, the terrorists were killed, we had turned the terror bases established in the heart of Pakistan into ruins. When Pakistan appealed, when it was said from Pakistan\u2019s side that no further terrorist activity and military audacity will be shown from its side, India also considered it. I am repeating, we have just deferred our retaliatory action on Pakistan\u2019s terrorist and military bases. In the coming days, we will measure every step of Pakistan on the basis of what attitude it adopts,\" said the PM. \u201cIndia\u2019s Air Force, Army, and Navy, our Border Security Force (BSF) and paramilitary forces are on alert. After the surgical strike and air strike, Operation Sindoor is India\u2019s policy against terrorism. Operation Sindoor has drawn a new line in the fight against terrorism, set a new standard, a new normal.\" \u201cFirst, If there is a terrorist attack on India, a befitting reply will be given. We will respond in our own way, on our own terms. We will take strict action at every place from where the roots of terrorism emerge. Second, India will not tolerate any nuclear blackmail. India will strike precisely and decisively on the terrorist bases flourishing under the guise of nuclear blackmail. Third, we will not see the government that patronises terrorism and the masters of terrorism separately.\" \u201cDuring Operation Sindoor, the world has again seen the ugly truth of Pakistan, when top officials of the Pakistani army thronged to bid farewell to the terrorists who were killed. This is a big proof of state-sponsored terrorism. We will continue to take decisive steps to protect India and our citizens from any threat,\" said Modi."

The GHQ is the direct reporting and command post of the Pakistan Army, located in Chaklala, in the vicinity of Rawalpindi, and adjacent to the Joint Staff Headquarters. Air Marshall AK Bharti, during the press briefing on Sunday, showed the before and after images of several spots, including the Chaklala airfield (Nur Khan). Rawalpindi\u2019s Nur Khan base is next to the Pakistan\u2019s army headquarters. It is closest to Islamabad and often used for VIP transport and military logistics. Its neutralisation severed critical links between the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) leadership and its operational units during the conflict, sources say. It houses critical assets such as Saab Erieye airborne early warning systems, C-130 transporters and IL-78 refueling aircraft. These systems are vital for surveillance, logistics, and aerial coordination, especially in cross-border operations. The base was central to Pakistan\u2019s drone warfare campaigns. By attacking it, India disrupted Pakistan\u2019s ability to conduct asymmetric attacks. The recent Indian drone and missile strikes on the Nur Khan Airbase have triggered the relocation buzz. \u201cThe deep penetration of Indian drones in Rawalpindi came a major shock. To avoid concentrating leadership and assets in one vulnerable location, the army is thinking of shifting Chinese-supplied HQ-9 and LY-80 systems,\" said sources. Earlier, CNN-News18 reported on Pakistan Army chief Asim Munir\u2019s relocation to a GHQ bunker during the strikes. \u201cThe potential relocation is likely to sites with geographical protection such as mountains in Balochistan or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,\" said sources. Moving GHQ would signal desperation, undermining the military\u2019s image. \u201cRelocating GHQ\u2019s command-and-control systems would take years and billions of dollars and is going to be a challenge for a debt-ridden economy,\" said Indian government sources. Admitting vulnerability is a major victory for India and it is going to strengthen domestic rivals such as Baloch insurgents and weaken public trust. \u201cDrone attacks revealed weaknesses in overlapping radar coverage, especially near the capital. The inability to protect GHQ and Nur Khan undermines Pakistan\u2019s narrative of military parity with India,\" they said. Sources said Pakistan\u2019s military now faces existential questions about its defensive capabilities and strategic posture."

It all started on Saturday, May 10, when Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to announce the ceasefire between India and Pakistan.

Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence.\" This statement, which was meant to be a diplomatic message, quickly became meme material, with users on X taking the phrase \u201clong night of talks\" quite literally and giving it their own hilarious take.

The bridge, to be constructed under the supervision of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), is estimated to cost around Rs 368 crore. Connecting Buxar in Bihar with Bharauli in Uttar Pradesh, it aims to significantly ease travel for local commuters. Of the total 3.2 km length, 1.2 km will be built west of the existing Veer Kunwar Singh Bridge, while a 2 km elevated railway rotary will be constructed from the Bharauli side. The project is intended to streamline and improve traffic flow in the region. According to available information, the bridge will have a total of 40 pillars, eight in the middle of the Ganga River and 32 on either side. The first pillar (P-1) will be located in Buxar while the last pillar (P-40) will be located on the Barauli side. Currently, soil testing is underway, with construction firm ASC Infratech conducting bore tests up to a depth of 170 feet and sending the samples to New Delhi for analysis. Construction work will begin once the Central Government approves the soil report. The bridge, announced in the general budget of 2024, had previously faced delays due to technical issues, resulting in the cancellation of DPR and tenders twice. However, a work order was finally issued on January 9, 2025, with construction expected to begin soon."

The wreckage of the Turkish-origin YIHA and Songar drones that were shot down by India were also shown. The Indian armed forces further reiterated that Operation Sindoor only targeted terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK), and that Islamabad was responsible for any loss that they incurred. \u201cOur fight was with terrorists and their infrastructure, and not Pakistan\u2019s military. That\u2019s why we struck only terror camps on May 7. It is a pity that Pakistan\u2019s military chose to side with terrorists and made it their own fight. That\u2019s why our retaliation was necessary. They are themselves responsible for their losses,\" Air Marshal Bharti said. Fighter jets of the India Air Force targeted Pakistan Air Force\u2019s bases at Rafiqui, Murid and Chaklala to counter Pakistan\u2019s reckless drone and missile attacks targeting civilian areas and military infrastructure in India\u2019s western sector. The Indian Armed Forces further confirmed that they destroyed Pakistani Mirage during the operation. PL-15 is a radar-guided long-range air-to-air missile developed by China. It is used by the country\u2019s air force. The Pakistan Air Force also uses the weapon. It was developed by the Luoyang-based China Airborne Missile Academy (CAMA). It was test-fired in 2011. It entered China\u2019s military in 2015. It was seen on China\u2019s Chengdu J-10C, the Shenyang J-16 and the Chengdu J-20 platforms. India launched \u201cprecision strikes\" under Operation Sindoor on nine terror targets in Pakistan and PoK following the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians. The strikes killed at least 10 family members of JeM chief Masood Azhar and four close aides. The sites targeted were the Pakistani bases at Rafiqui (Shorkot, Jhang), Murid (Chakwal), Nur Khan (Chaklala, Rawalpindi) Rahim Yar Khan, Sukkur and Chunian (Kasur). In the strikes, the air bases in Skardu, Bholari, Jacobabad and Sargodha suffered extensive damage."

            "text": "However, according to several experts, drawing parallels between the 1971 war and the recent Operation Sindoor might be misleading. While both achieved their respective objectives, they differ significantly in context, scale, and impact, and should be viewed within their distinct historical and strategic frameworks, they said. The 1971 war was a full-scale military conflict that began on December 3 and ended on December 16. It was triggered by widespread human rights violations and a massive refugee crisis in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), where the Pakistani army persecuted the Bengali population. The violence forced nearly 10 million refugees to flee into India. In response, India initially provided humanitarian aid and extended support to the Bengali resistance force, the Mukti Bahini. When Pakistan launched an attack, India declared a full-scale war, engaging across land, air, and sea. Striking on both the eastern and western fronts, India achieved a decisive victory in just 13 days, leading to the liberation of East Pakistan and the creation of Bangladesh. On December 16, 1971, 93,000 Pakistani soldiers surrendered in Dhaka, marking India\u2019s greatest military triumph. Unlike limited operations, this war led to a significant territorial and political shift in South Asia. In contrast, Operation Sindoor was a precision military strike launched on the night of May 7 to dismantle terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied to avenge the massacre of 26 Indian tourists in J&K\u2019s Pahalgam two weeks earlier. According to military experts, comparing the 1971 war with Operation Sindoor is not appropriate, given their vastly different objectives and contexts. While Indira Gandhi led India through a full-scale war that resulted in the creation of Bangladesh, Operation Sindoor, conducted under Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s leadership, was a limited but targeted military action aimed at dismantling terrorist infrastructure. While the 1971 war reshaped South Asia\u2019s political landscape, Operation Sindoor was intended to send a strong message to Pakistan and the terrorist groups it backs, without escalating into a broader conflict. Both achieved their stated goals within the frameworks in which they were carried out. Operation Sindoor targeted terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK and it reportedly resulted in the destruction of two terrorist headquarters and 11 Pakistani military sites. It has also been reported that the Indian forces deployed over 400 drones, 30 missiles, and several fighter jets during the strikes."

The force added that a detailed briefing will be conducted in due course, even as India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire on Saturday.

            "text": "In the middle of a heightened conflict with India last week, cash-strapped Pakistan managed to secure a loan of $1 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). India registered its protest at the board of IMF, but abstained from voting at the crucial meeting, leading to the question \u2013 why did India abstain from voting in the middle of war-like conditions with Pakistan instead of voting \u2018no\u2019? India has consistently raised concerns over the efficacy of IMF programmes in the case of Pakistan, given its poor track record, and also on the possibility of misuse of debt financing funds for state-sponsored cross-border terrorism. According to Indian government sources, India abstained from the vote because IMF rules do not permit a formal \u2018no\u2019 vote. They added that the rules allow either any of the 25 directors, who represent member countries or groups of countries, to vote in favour of a proposal or abstain to show their disapproval. The consensus-based approach of the IMF means that hostile voting is rare and can lead to diplomatic isolation or perceived disruptions in global financial stability. India, aiming to establish itself as a responsible global player, refrained from voting against Pakistan to avoid destabilising regional stability. India also recognises the potential consequences of a collapsing Pakistani economy, including increased militancy and refugee flows that could destabilise neighbouring regions. India requested that the IMF ensure the funds are not allocated to Pakistan\u2019s military or used to repay other loans, particularly from China. This stance aligns with India\u2019s broader strategy of exerting economic pressure through diplomatic channels rather than direct opposition. The IMF has been urged to implement strict monitoring to ensure the funds are not diverted to cross-border terrorism or military expenditure. No, India voting against it would not have stopped the loan, because other countries would have voted in favour. The US has a 16.5% stake in the IMF. The EU collectively has about 25-30% stake. India has only around 2.7% stake. India could have certainly voted no, but it would have been diplomatically costly. India\u2019s approach reflects a careful balance: by abstaining from the IMF vote, it signals disapproval without direct opposition, seeks to influence terms and conditions quietly and avoids moves that could further destabilise the region."

            "text": "Such civilian-led contributions harken back to the days of the 1965 India-Pakistan War. One of the most storied instances from that era involves Mir Osman Ali Khan, the last Nizam of Hyderabad \u2013 then regarded as one of the richest men in the world. While folklore has long credited him with donating 5,000 kg of gold to the Indian Army, historical records suggest otherwise. In reality, the Nizam contributed 425 kg of gold, not as a donation, but as an investment in the National Defence Gold Scheme initiated by the government. This investment was made following a personal appeal by then prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, who met the Nizam during a fundraising tour of Hyderabad. According to a report dated December 11, 1965, in an English-language newspaper, Shastri acknowledged the Nizam\u2019s contribution during a public address, noting that the gold \u2013 valued at Rs 50 lakh at the time \u2013 was deposited in the form of coins, whose authenticity and purity were later verified. \u201cWe do not want to melt these gold coins, but want to send them to some other country so that we can get a higher price for it,\" Shastri had reportedly remarked. His government was also buoyed by a 125 kg gold donation from the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) and a Rs 8 lakh donation from a prominent Telugu film actor. The most common way to contribute to the armed forces\u2019 efforts now is the National Defence Fund. The NDF of India was established in 1962 to support the welfare of members of the Indian armed forces, paramilitary forces, and their dependents. It is used primarily to assist the families of soldiers who have lost their lives or suffered serious injuries while serving the nation. The fund is managed by an executive committee headed by the Prime Minister, with the Defence, Finance, and Home Ministers as members."

            "text": "To my surprise, ChatGPT broke down the details in very simple language. It not only explained the results but also suggested possible treatment options and listed some of the best doctors in India for the identified deficiencies. That night, I found myself in an extended conversation with AI\u2013asking it a series of questions, almost like I would ask a doctor. Of course, I knew I was speaking to an AI tool, not a qualified medical professional. Yet, when I later discussed the findings with my doctor, I was amazed to see that much of what ChatGPT had explained matched the medical advice I received. My experience isn\u2019t unique. Just last month, I came across a news story about a woman in Paris, Marly Garnreiter, who credited ChatGPT with identifying the possibility of her having cancer\u2014before any medical expert had confirmed it. \u201cNot only did ChatGPT tell him about the diagnosis, but also treatment, and where he could find treatment. AI is very powerful,\" Yadav recalled and added, \u201cAI uses information available on the Internet to give you an answer. It would be highly accurate if lots of data were available about a topic, and very wrong if very little or no data were available. It\u2019s 100,000 times faster than Google.\" Dr Swapnil M Khadake, head, critical care at Fortis Hiranandani Hospital, Vashi, noted that the growing popularity of AI health apps like ChatGPT is changing how patients engage with doctors. He shared his experience with patients. \u201cPeople now come to us having already discussed symptoms and potential diagnoses with these apps. Some even arrive with specific questions or preconceived notions, all shaped by what the apps have told them.\" Doctors are now navigating not just misinformation from internet searches, but also AI-generated content that may not always be accurate. \u201cThis ChatGPT trend reflects the direction healthcare is heading,\" said Dr Khadake. \u201cMedical professionals will increasingly encounter patients who consult AI tools before seeing a doctor. Our job is to correct misconceptions, ensure accurate understanding, and educate patients about the limitations of artificial intelligence in medical diagnosis.\" Doctors now need to balance the benefits of AI with the importance of their own medical expertise. As AI tools become more common, it\u2019s important to understand how they can help\u2014without replacing the role of real doctors. Dhaliwal says it doesn\u2019t mean parents don\u2019t trust him; it only means they want to be more informed and that is good. \u201cI have accepted AI as a reality and have moved forward, but with caution. I honestly don\u2019t have a problem if patients read up or chat with online tools about their illness. It shows they\u2019re curious and involved in their own care,\" Dhaliwal said. A small study reported by The New York Times found that ChatGPT actually outperformed human doctors in some diagnostic tasks. The study showed that ChatGPT scored an average of 90 per cent in diagnosing medical conditions based on case reports, compared to 76 per cent for doctors who used the chatbot and 74 per cent for those who didn\u2019t. Dr Rajeev Jayadevan believes that while technology like ChatGPT is helpful for professionals, it should be used as a supportive tool, not a standalone diagnostic source. \u201cAI can help broaden a clinician\u2019s thinking by suggesting possibilities they might not immediately consider\u2014similar to ordering an additional lab test,\" he said. However, he cautioned against patients relying solely on ChatGPT or Google for self-diagnosis. \u201cAt the end of the day, what a patient really needs is clarity, peace of mind, and reassurance\u2014which only a trained human professional can truly provide.\" In short, AI like ChatGPT is transforming how we use healthcare, but it\u2019s not a replacement for medical professionals or doctors. If used wisely, it can empower patients and support doctors. One thing is clear\u2014the future of medicine isn\u2019t man versus machine but it\u2019s their collaboration."

            "title": "'It Was About Reclaiming Identity': Historic Tent That Housed Ram Lalla For 30 Years To Be Part Of Ram Temple",
            "text": "How did a humble temple tent, which housed Ram Lalla for over three decades in the heart of Ayodhya, come to be? The iconic pink-coloured tent, erected in the chaotic aftermath of the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992 to shelter the idol of Lord Ram will now, after the announcement of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust, be preserved along with a traditional wooden throne within the grand Ram Mandir complex as sacred memorials. As the announcement rekindled memories of the turbulent days of 1992, News18 delved deep into the past\u2014revisiting how the tent temple came into existence, tracing its transformations, and speaking to old-time Karsevaks, residents of Ayodhya, and priests who were witness to the moment the tent took shape in the immediate aftermath of the demolition. \u201cWe had little time,\" recalls Santosh Dubey, a Karsevak who played an active role in both the temple movement and the immediate erection of the makeshift shrine. \u201cThere was a clear plan\u2014once the structure was brought down, Ram Lalla must not be left in the open.\" It was not just a spontaneous act of faith, but part of the broader planning. A dozen Karsevaks were assigned the specific task of ensuring that Ram Lalla was given a roof before nightfall. Dubey told News18 that the tent and tarpaulin, used by the truckers to cover the loaded goods, were arranged by Mahant Devramdas Vedanti, while the other part of the covering came from Gyani Ji of the Brahmakund Gurudwara. Within hours, a tent temple\u2014fragile, improvised, and sacred\u2014stood at the site, sheltering the idol of Ram Lalla. It was a structure born not just of urgency, but of immense devotion, he added. Among the most compelling personal recollections is that of Baba Satyanarayan Maurya, another key Karsevak and spiritual figure. He remembers the moment not as chaos, but as divine clarity. \u201cWe were told the police would enter any minute. If Ram Lalla wasn\u2019t seated, the land might again be claimed as disputed,\" he says. According to Baba, the materials for the first temple\u2014banner cloth, jute ropes, wooden poles\u2014were sourced in desperation. \u201cBhagwan Ram gave us the strength. We built with what little we had,\" he recounts. The idol was installed even before the structure was fully complete, with chants of \u201cJai Shri Ram\" echoing through the night. He said it was at the same time, a popular slogan\u2014Rama Lalla hum ayenge, Mandir Wahin Banayenge, which later became a face of Ram temple movement\u2014was coined. Vinod Mishra, a resident shopkeeper, remembers how carpets, plastic sheets, and spare cloth were donated and stitched together. \u201cPeople wept while setting up the tent. They believed something eternal was being born,\" he recalls. Though built in haste, the rituals inside the tent mirrored the grandeur of any formal temple. Each day began with Mangal Aarti, followed by bhog, shringar, and Sandhya Aarti. Ram Lalla\u2019s attire followed a strict weekly colour schedule\u2014white for Monday (Chandra), red for Tuesday (Hanuman), and so on, culminating in saffron on Sunday (Surya). From humble jute to engineered fire-proof fabric, the tent evolved without losing its identity. By 2015, it was replaced with a modern canopy designed by an institute in Roorkee at a cost of Rs 12 lakh. Still, it was known as a \u201ctent temple\"\u2014a symbol of simplicity and sanctity. However now, as Ram Lalla has moved to his permanent sanctum, the tent and wooden throne will serve a new purpose\u2014as historical artefacts enshrined within the temple complex. \u201cThe tent and throne will remind pilgrims of the long, emotional journey. These are not just objects\u2014they are sacred witnesses,\" said Nripendra Misra, chairman of the Temple Construction Committee. While sharing the future plans, he said it includes the creation of green zones named Panchvati, a completed parkota (boundary wall), and the upcoming consecration of Ram Darbar on the first floor. As landscaping, security, and sanctity merge, the spirit of the tent will live on\u2014not just in form, but in faith. The tent that once shielded a deity will now protect a memory, which is etched into history."

While food inflation is moderating, experts said that commodities such as copra, palm oil, tea and coffee remain as key monitorables. Overall, consumer companies are hoping for improvement in consumption trends during FY26 due to better macro-economic factors. Speaking at Q4FY25 earnings call, Mohit Malhotra, CEO, Dabur India said the company had taken an average price increase of about 3.5 per cent in the quarter. \u201cWe have taken a price increase of around 4.5- 5 per cent in Health Care.

On the Q4FY25 earnings call earlier this month, Saugata Gupta, MD & CEO, Marico Ltd said, \u201cDuring the quarter, consumer sentiment remained largely stable, supported by improving rural demand and mixed trends across mass and affluent urban segments. Margins for most players were under pressure due to input cost pressures.\u201d The company stated that it has hiked the prices of products such as Parachute and Saffola Edible oil. \u201cEasing retail and food inflation is encouraging for consumption trends going ahead.

            "text": "Thomas Cook India reported a profitable fourth quarter at a pre-tax level, with 19 per cent revenue growth. While net profit reduced year-on-year due to a higher tax outgo, the company is confident of improving its performance in FY 2026, CEO and Managing Director, Mahesh Iyer, tells businessline in an interview Thomas Cook India\u2019s consolidated pre-tax profit grew on a quarterly and annual basis in FY25. What were the main growth drivers? All our business units had a great year, barring our digital imaging solutions business. We had strong growth in our forex business in terms of revenue and profitability, with a 45 per cent EBIT (earning before interest and tax) margin. We expect to have a similar EBIT margin in forex in FY26. In the forex business, our focus has been to address various segments through the pre-paid route. The pre-paid borderless cards have enabled us to grow faster than the market within that segment. On the travel side, the destination management business and National Games (Thomas Cook was travel partner) contributed to growth. The long-haul business also saw higher growth compared to the first quarter of 2024, and it continues to play out in summer as well. We operate in the outbound travel space in Hong Kong and India. In India, the long-haul segment has recovered to 80-85 per cent, but the overall rate is only 68-72 per cent, due to slower recovery in Hong Kong. Visa challenges have been a handicap on the long-haul side. We continue to have challenges, but the situation is better than in 2024. What impact do you see on travel demand post the Pahalgam terror attack? What is the growth guidance for FY26? There has been demand softness for the last two weeks, but I would qualify it as temporary. With the de-escalation and opening of airports, some amount of recovery will happen. We believe there is a booking cycle available to us and there will be some amount of elongation of the travel period from June to July-August. My belief is that the travel industry should grow at 12-15 per cent, and I think we will mirror the industry growth. Multiple destinations have opened up, including Japan, Vietnam and other easy visa destinations, and all these add to our product portfolio. We had targeted to keep our costs at 40 per cent below the pre-pandemic level for four years and I am happy to report that we have still not reached the 2019 cost base. Benefits from automation, productivity enhancements and common buying (by Thomas Cook and SOTC) are playing out. We follow a cost-to-revenue matrix. Our cost increase will be proportionate to revenue growth. Pre-pandemic our cost-to-revenue ratio used to be closer to 85 per cent. We are now operating at 62-63 per cent. We continue to take tactical and strategic calls regarding marketing, and investments like the recent appointment of actor Kartik Aryan as brand ambassador for our borderless prepaid card."

The tech sector has emerged as a primary growth driver, with new jobs in India\u2019s IT and start-up ecosystem growing approximately 20 per cent in Q1, continuing the momentum from 17 per cent growth in 2024. E-commerce has experienced a 9 per cent hiring increase in H1 2025 compared with H2 2024, particularly for logistics managers and data analysts. Neeti Sharma, CEO of TeamLease Digital, noted that AI and machine learning roles saw the fastest growth at 36 per cent in December 2024. \u201cHealth tech, pharma tech and deep tech sectors show stronger recovery with increased funding and headcount expansion,\u201d she added. The most in-demand skills now centre around emerging technologies, with start-ups primarily seeking talent in AI, machine learning, cloud computing and data analytics. \u201cEngineering jobs like software engineers, DevOps engineers and full-stack developers are seeing a 20 per cent increase in demand, especially for those skilled in Docker, Kubernetes and cloud platforms,\u201d Sharma explained. Previous layoffs primarily affected support functions and non-engineering roles, but these positions are largely not being refilled. Instead, companies are restructuring for greater efficiency, partly enabled by AI adoption. \u201cAI has been a game-changer and will continue to make teams more efficient. AI-first opportunities will continue to be lean and mean,\u201d Shivani said, explaining why hiring will remain cautious throughout 2025 despite the recovery. The geographical hiring pattern is also evolving, with more start-ups looking beyond metropolitan areas. \u201cThere is a clear focus at start-ups to hire from beyond metros in order to bring in cognitive diversity,\u201d Sharma observed, noting this approach helps build more inclusive teams while expanding the available talent pool. While metro cities continue to dominate in senior and highly technical roles, start-ups are intentionally widening their reach to build diverse, skilled and agile teams across India and even globally. SaaS and health tech start-ups have demonstrated better workforce retention than sectors like e-commerce, with health tech expecting over 30 per cent hiring growth in 2025, driven by expansion in diagnostics and chronic care management solutions."

He also underlined that Operation Sindoor marked India\u2019s future strategy against terrorism, and said that India has \u201cjust suspended\u201d retaliatory action, and future strategy would depend on Pakistan\u2019s response. Market analysts were positive on the defence sector\u2019s outlook. Vikas Jain, Head of Research at Reliance Securities, commented: \u201cExpect long-term positive on defence stocks after domestic defense players have shown strong performance in the India-Pakistan geo-political tension. Expect strong overseas order.\u201d Kranthi Bathini, Director of Equity Strategy at WealthMills Securities, noted that, despite being \u201cpricey,\u201d every dip in defence stocks \u201ccan be a buying opportunity for long\u201d term investments. He further explained, \u201cThe tailwinds and also the government focus towards defense and making Make in India is the key triggers for defence and also the other thing is right now defence companies have demonstrated their capabilities, so that is also adding some extra interest for defense stocks.\u201d Bajaj Broking Research said, \u201cDefence-related counters saw strong accumulation, buoyed by renewed market enthusiasm around the indigenisation of defence manufacturing and equipment.\u201d India\u2019s defence exports reached a record \u20b923,622 crore in FY25, representing a 12 per cent year-on-year increase. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has set an ambitious target of \u20b950,000 crore in defence exports by 2029."

            "text": "Following its organisational rejig and leadership changes, Happiest Minds reported a revenue hike of 31 per cent y-o-y and 2.6 per cent q-o-q to \u20b9545 crore in Q4FY25. The company\u2019s PAT, however, stood at \u20b934 crore, posting a 52.8 per cent y-o-y and 32.1 per cent q-o-q decline. Venkatraman Narayanan, MD & CFO, and Joseph Anantharaju, Co-Chairman and newly appointed CEO, discuss priorities for FY26, which include integrating acquisitions, pursuing private equity, and achieving double-digit growth in the upcoming fiscal year. Venkatraman: We had decent growth but took a small knock on the profitability for the quarter. The primary reason is that we had to take a knock of almost \u20b912.5 crores for a bad debt that came and hit us this quarter. This was a customer for whom we had ramped up to $1.5 million in revenues in Q3. But because of certain problems with their end customers, US government-supported institutions, they stopped funding. We understand this happened under the new dispensation. Since they couldn\u2019t make payments, we stopped work in January, but what we had built in Q3, we wrote, so it had an impact. But if you adjust for that in terms of profitability, we are close to last year; similar at the EBITDA level. Year over year, our EBITDA has grown, which shows that the revenue growth has come with profitability growth. This increase is after the investment of about \u20b940 crore we made in GBS services early this year, and the new sales team we have been putting in place. There is also noise from acquisition costs, non-cash charges, goodwill impairment, and earn-out payments. In PAT, we would have been higher than last year, but those are investments we are making for the longer term and business health. Effectively, the top line has grown both q-o-q and y-o-y. We integrated the companies we acquired early last year, and they are beginning to pull their weight, helping us with growth. We continue to build and invest in our platform, which is showing decent growth and profitability. Last fiscal year was a difficult year. Next year, we are looking at double-digit growth and are holding on to the 20-22 per cent EBITDA guidance from last year. We\u2019ll try to improve in FY26. Joseph: At the end of the day, when half the IT spend either originates or happens in the US, you will have to focus on it and get as much growth as possible. Having said that, in our geowise revenue split, between FY23 and FY25, and between quarters, even though we are growing as a company, the share of the US has been dropping. For instance, in FY24, we were at 70.7 per cent, and down to 64.6 per cent in FY25. In Q4, it\u2019s even lower at 62 per cent. The acquisitions had a larger share of revenues outside of the US, like in Africa, in the case of Pure Software. As a result, there\u2019s a diversification of revenue. We expect that in FY26, the US would be between 61 per cent to 63 per cent, which is a good number. May be we will push the other geos to grow faster, with which the acquisitions and some implemented strategies are helping."

            "text": "Equity finance is also gaining ground, especially among medium and small enterprises in growth phases | Photo Credit: SRIRAM MA Despite a steady rise in credit supply, India\u2019s micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector continues to face a significant credit gap, estimated at approximately \u20b930 lakh crore, according to a report by SIDBI (Small Industries Development Bank of India). While traditional lenders struggle to bridge this gap due to challenges such as information asymmetry and lack of collateral, alternative finance is gaining traction as a viable solution. The total finance demand from the MSME sector is pegged at \u20b9123 lakh crore, with debt accounting for around \u20b992 lakh crore, based on an assumed 3:1 debt-equity ratio. Of this, about \u20b964 lakh crore is considered addressable debt demand. However, with banks and NBFCs supplying only \u20b934 lakh crore in formal debt, the remaining \u20b930 lakh crore forms the addressable credit gap, said the report titled \u201cUnderstanding Indian MSME sector: Progress and Challenges. Medium enterprises face the steepest shortfall at 29 per cent, followed by micro and small enterprises. Sector-wise, trading MSMEs face the largest gap at 33 per cent, followed by services (27 per cent) and manufacturing and allied sectors (20 per cent). This is because most of the trading MSMEs face a working capital shortfall due to inability to provide collateral given their business model. Regionally, rural MSMEs encounter a higher credit gap (32 per cent) than urban counterparts (20 per cent) due to fewer financial institutions and lower industrial activity. Female-owned enterprises are particularly disadvantaged, facing a 35 per cent credit gap compared to 20 per cent for male-owned MSMEs, prompting many to rely on informal credit sources. To counter these challenges, alternative and digital lending solutions are emerging as promising alternatives. Fintech companies, in collaboration with traditional banks, are expanding digital lending infrastructure, raising awareness, and pushing for greater financial inclusion. Although only 18 per cent of surveyed MSMEs currently use digital lending platforms, over 90 per cent accept digital payments\u2014highlighting strong readiness for digital finance adoption. Sectors such as hospitality, auto components, pharmaceuticals, and garments, which already exhibit a moderate to high digital presence, offer greater potential for digital credit offtake. Platforms like the Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS), now accessible to more MSMEs due to revised eligibility norms, are further improving access to working capital."

Nissan is also accelerating its restructuring. The carmaker will close the seven manufacturing facilities by the 2027 fiscal year, with annual production capacity set to fall to 2.5 million units from 3.5 million last year. The sweeping changes signal a major departure from previous CEO Makoto Uchida, who was criticized for not being aggressive enough with his plan to cut 9,000 jobs and reduce production by 20 per cent. Nissan had indicated broader plans to cut output, announcing last week that it was abandoning plans to build a battery plant in Fukuoka in order to focus on its own recovery. Even with deepening cuts, Nissan faces an uphill battle in finding a savior with the collapse of tie-up talks with Honda complicating its search. Meanwhile, Nissan\u2019s restructuring efforts risk being derailed by US tariffs on imported cars and auto parts. The carmaker said it expects to see a \u00a5450 billion impact from policies, which is included in its forecast for a \u00a5200 billion operating loss in the first quarter. Exports from Mexico and Japan account for almost 45% of Nissan\u2019s sales in the US, Chief Financial Officer Jeremie Papin said. Duties will affect 300,000 units in exports from Mexico, and 120,000 units from Japan, he said. Separately, Renault, which has a roughly 36% stake in Nissan, said it expects to see a \u20ac2.2 billion ($2.4 billion) hit to its first-quarter net income due to the Japanese carmaker\u2019s turnaround efforts."

Analysts have pointed out that with a decrease in demand for air conditioners, consumer durable makers are sitting on high inventories, which they had stockpiled in anticipation of a hot summer that would send demand spiking. \u201cUnseasonal rains in April/May have impacted AC demand, which would be reflected in weak primary sales in 1Q26 as inventory remains elevated. Rising competition and aggressive pricing/higher discounts to recover market share are likely to lead to margin risks for Voltas despite production-linked incentives (PLI). Increased backwards integration should keep costs elevated,\u201d said a Nomura commentary on Voltas. \u201cThe company is hopeful that with the IMD forecast of a tough summer from May 12, there will be a pick-up. We are a seasoned player, and it will be a disappointment if the rains continue throughout the summer. Last year, we were not happy in the room air conditioner segment in Q1, and we did not get market share, but it picked up, and we did better in Q3 and Q4. Our goal is to have 15 per cent market share quickly,\u201d said B Thiagarajan, Managing Director of Blue Star Ltd, during an earnings call. The company, in its near-term outlook, stated that April witnessed milder weather and softer growth. Going by the weather forecast, the company expects the demand to pick up in May and June. Consumer electronics retail chains pointed out that the category was also impacted by fewer heat waves in southern India this year. Companies are expecting the air conditioner category to grow in low-single digit up to 3 per cent this summer. \u201cThe temperatures did not go up in the South region as expected because of unseasonal rains. The west region also saw continuous rains for two weeks, which has resulted in the air conditioners segment being hit. The dip in the southern region is 30 per cent, and on a country level, the decrease would be between 10 and 15 per cent. Even in the north, the temperatures did not go up as expected. The overall growth of air conditioners depends on the last two weeks of May and early June, and if there is a delayed summer, then only the category will revive. The revival is also we are anticipated in north India,\u201d Nilesh Gupta, Director, Vijay Sales, told businessline."

            "text": "A Joint Working Group (JWG) formed by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG) has suggested subsiding private operators who supply natural gas to the north eastern States. On enhancing natural gas supply in the north East, the JWG suggested that a subsidy of 40 per cent on supply of natural gas may be extended to every operator in the North-East region. The JWG explained that the existing gas price mechanism in the north-east region is characterised by the coexistence of multiple gas prices, which poses significant challenges for private operators. According to the new domestic natural gas pricing guidelines, a subsidy of 40 per cent on administered price mechanism (APM) allocated to natural gas is provided to the NoCs in the region. However, the guidelines lack clarity in applicability of the subsidy for natural gas supplied by private operators in the north-east region. This arrangement allows ONGC and OIL to benefit from discounted gas prices and undermines the competitiveness of private companies, the JWG explained."

From packing jewellery and watch orders in a small warehouse in London during Titan\u2019s early days in Europe, to soon helming the company, Chawla\u2019s journey reflects a deep-rooted journey within the Tata ecosystem. Chawla\u2019s journey with the Tata Group began after completing his post-graduate diploma in management from IIM Calcutta, when he was inducted into the Tata Administrative Service (TAS). He joined Titan in 1990 and has since risen steadily through the ranks, currently serving as the head of the Jewellery Division since 2019. A mechanical engineer by training, Chawla spent the initial years of his career in Titan\u2019s Watches Division, where he held various roles across commercial functions, sales, retailing, supply chain and SAP implementation. He also led the Accessories and Licensed Brands strategic business unit (SBU), gaining deep cross-functional exposure. In the book Titan: Inside India\u2019s Most Successful Consumer Brand, Chawla recalled his early days in Titan\u2019s European operations, which floundered, when he sometimes himself packed jewellery and watches for sale. \u201cI\u2019d quickly freshen up, suit up and soon be discussing business plans for our European operations,\u201d he recounted, highlighting both the agility and entrepreneurial spirit that marked his early leadership style. Later, in the 2000s, Chawla headed strategy and business incubation for Titan and was closely involved with former MD Bhaskar Bhat in Titan\u2019s exercise, Future Shock, which had around 60 middle and senior managers of the company brainstorming ideas for the future. Many ideas were thrown up, and one of them was eyewear, which he piloted. It took a lot of convincing on Chawla\u2019s part to make his colleagues understand that wearing stylish spectacles was a style statement and prescription wear was not a health issue. From 2013 to 2019, Chawla served as Titan\u2019s Chief Strategy Officer while continuing to lead business incubation. During this period, he scaled up the fragrances business and laid the foundation for Taneira and Titan\u2019s entry into the saree segment. Later, he moved on to lead Tanishq \u2014 Titan\u2019s flagship jewellery business, which he continues to head."

The market rally was underpinned by the weekend agreement between India and Pakistan to cease military operations across land, air, and sea. A scheduled meeting between the Director Generals of Military Operations (DGMO) from both countries further supported the positive sentiment. Trading volumes were substantial, with the tourism index recording transactions worth \u20b92,658.71 crores and the defence index seeing \u20b97,239.72 crores in trades.

The potential reopening of airports that were closed following the recent military standoff, including strategic locations like Srinagar and Amritsar, has generated significant interest among investors. This development comes in the wake of the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack and the subsequent military tensions that had previously dampened market sentiment. Sector experts suggest that the de-escalation and potential normalization of trade relations could provide a much-needed boost to tourism and defence-related businesses that had been under pressure due to recent geopolitical uncertainties."

            "text": "India\u2019s thermal coal imports rose to an 11 month high in April 2025 as the power sector stocked up supplies for the blistering summer season with peak electricity demand (day) likely to hit 270 gigawatts (GW) this month. According to global real-time data and analytics provider Kpler, India\u2019s purchases of foreign thermal coal, usually procured by the power sector, rose by 6.6 per cent m-o-m to 15.40 million tonnes (mt) last month, provisionally. However, it fell by around 2.8 per cent on an annual basis. The higher import requirement also reflects on the government\u2019s direction to imported coal based (ICB) power plants to run capacities at optimum levels till June 30. On cumulative imports during April, Alexis Ellender, Senior Lead Dry Bulks Insight at Kpler, told businessline \u201cWe are in the peak season for Indian thermal coal consumption as hot weather drives demand. Meanwhile, the country\u2019s steel producers continue to perform strongly. These are supporting coal imports, which hit the highest level since May 2024 at 22.19 mt last month.\u201d Indian thermal coal imports climbed to an eleven-month high of 15.40 mt in April, although still 0.44 mt lower on an annual basis. The annual decline results from growth in domestic coal production, up by 4 per cent y-o-y in April, and a slight yearly decrease in coal-fired generation, he explained. \u201cMay thermal coal imports are forecast to stay firm at 15-16 mt but, despite a government mandate to boost coal-fired generation, are expected to be below May 2024\u2019s 17.70 mt. This is due to a combination of higher domestic production and near-record coal stockpiles,\u201d Ellender added. India\u2019s energy consumption rose 2.2 per cent y-o-y to 147.5 billion units (BU), with April 25th recording a peak demand of 235 GW (April 2024: 224 GW). Despite higher power demand, average market clearing price in the Day Ahead Market in April remained competitive at \u20b95.20 per unit, similar to last year, due to increased supply, IEX added."

Overall its international business which comprises owned and managed hotels in the US, UK, Cape Town, Dubai and Sri Lanka accounts for 20 per cent of the consolidated revenue.

IHCL posted\u20b9522 crore net profit in fourth quarter FY 2025, a growth of 25 per cent over the previous year. Revenue grew 27 per cent as the company benefited from strong domestic demand and faster than anticipated growth in new business ventures such as homestays and food delivery. On a full year basis profit grew by 52 per cent to \u20b91908 crore driven by double digit growth in Revenue per available room (RevPAR). The company continues to widen its footprint increasing its operating and pipeline hotels to 380. Chhatwal also announced \u20b91200 crore capex in FY 2025 towards hotel upgrades and expansion. This will be used for brand enhancement and building new markets, Chhatwal said. This includes upgradation of hotel in Kozhikode, construction of new hotel at Mopa airport in Goa and renovations projects among others.

Edited Excerpts: The US is the largest economy and India\u2019s biggest trading partner. So, it\u2019s going to be the largest and most important FTA for India. A trade pact has to be mutually beneficial. It can\u2019t be one way. It has to be constructed taking advantage of complementarities and synergies. In some sectors there will be more trade from one side, while in others the other side will have more. We welcome the India-UK FTA which is very comprehensive and impacts all sectors of the economy\u2013services, agriculture and manufacturing. It opens up opportunities to enhance bilateral trade. This agreement is also like a template for the future, and gives a very bold message to the world that India is ready to sign FTAs and integrate in the global value chain. It will also provide impetus to creating resilient supply chains or alternative supply chains in the world. India becomes a preferred country because it has scale, economies of production and stem talent. And besides that India is a large growing consumer market."

            "text": "As India ramps up efforts to become self-reliant in defence, start-ups in the defence tech sector are seeing a rising interest from investors. According to data from Tracxn, since 2019, these start-ups have raised a total of $349 million across 91 equity funding rounds. Geopolitics, policy push and innovation fuel this growth. The use of drones in global conflicts coupled with rising geopolitical tensions has highlighted a need for developing cost-effective, more responsive Indigenous defence technology. \u201cFor countries like India, which are still building out fifth-generation capabilities and whose defence budgets are significantly smaller than global powers, technologies like drones offer scalable and indigenous alternatives,\u201d said Abhishek Prasad, Managing Partner at Cornerstone Ventures. Beyond conflict-driven urgency, there\u2019s a strong policy push and increasing government support with initiatives like Atmanirbhar Bharat and Make in India programs that have attracted a lot of strategic investments. \u201cAs of February 2025, these efforts have led to the signing of over 253 Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs), attracting potential investments worth \u20b953,439 crore. Additionally, the Defence Production and Export Promotion Policy (DPEPP 2020) aims to double defence production and increase exports by 2025, creating opportunities for start-ups,\u201d said Neha Singh Co-Founder of Tracxn. Investors prioritise start-ups with strong technical depth, a focused USP and the ability to scale across mission-critical use cases. This also includes regulatory readiness, adaptable and modular technology, and the ability to collaborate with larger defence primes, who still receive a bulk of the procurement budgets. \u201cIP ownership is important, but more than that, we assess whether the technology can evolve in a rapidly changing ecosystem. Defence needs shift fast\u2014today it\u2019s surveillance, tomorrow it could be kamikaze or payload delivery. So we focus on core technology that is modular and adaptable. Regulatory readiness is also critical, as is the ability to collaborate with larger defence primes, since a majority of the procurement budget still flows to bigger players,\u201d said Prasad. \u201cInvestors are showing growing interest in dual-use technologies with both military and civilian applications, such as autonomous drones, AI surveillance systems, underwater drones, and hyperspectral satellites,\u201d Singh stated. There is a growing demand for offensive capabilities like payload delivery, suicide drones, and mission-autonomous systems. This also leaves room for collaboration. \u201c We expect to see more collaborations\u2014between start-ups and large OEMs, and between different start-ups, that bring complementary capabilities. Going forward, the most successful defence-tech players in India will be those that focus on building foundational capabilities that power a wider ecosystem\u2014whether that\u2019s in communication, control systems or AI-driven autonomy,\u201d Prasad added."

Last week, India and the UK sealed a landmark FTA that will lower tariffs on 99 per cent of Indian exports and would make it easier for British firms to export whisky, cars and other products to India, besides boosting the overall trade basket. The aim is to double two-way commerce by 2030 from the present $60 billion India has included adequate safeguards in the agreement to protect its sensitive sectors and in the automobile segment, the import duty will be reduced over 10-15 years. The duty concession on imports of petrol and diesel engine vehicles from the UK is limited to a pre-defined quota. \"Fundamentally, we have always advocated free trade as a multinational company, because we feel that free trade helps in better growth... So I think for us, definitely it's a real welcome move, because it helps,\" Mercedes-Benz India MD and CEO Santosh Iyer told PTI. He noted that there is an expectation of price cuts for cars due to the India-UK pact and also because of the under-discussion India-EU FTA. \"Around 95 per cent of the cars we (industry) sell in India are all CKDs. Which means hardly 15-16 per cent duty even today. So to expect a huge price correction, I don't think it would happen even with an FTA,\" Iyer said. BMW Group India President and CEO Vikram Pawah said the automaker supports free market access and reduction of trade barriers as it's a win-win situation for overall economic growth and benefits the consumers. \"India-UK FTA seems to be a landmark deal covering various aspects of mutual trade in goods, services, and mobility and will contribute to the greater vision of Viksit Bharat,\" he added. \"At the same time, BMW Group India has very strong local production and localisation in the Indian market and remains committed towards that,\" he stated.

In March this year we did over 16.5 million transactions. On average today, ONDC carries out between 5-6 lakh transactions daily. By next year, we will likely add one more zero to this number,\u201d said Koshy, adding how the company is focusing beyond food and mobility. The company has onboarded 8 lakh service providers so far including, merchants, taxi drivers, shopeepers, as well as brands like Dominos and Unilever, said Koshy. Earlier news reports claimed that organisations like National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) had paused or withdrawn from engagement with ONDC. The two entities have since issued a joint statement about collaborating to empower food businesses in the digital world, dismissing all rumours. Speaking about ONDC\u2019s future prospects, Koshy said the company is trying to maximise investment by not \u201cthrowing money for media and predatory pricing to take control of the market.\u201d He estimated the media budget of the top nine e-commerce companies in India was \u20b910,000 crores, while ONDC has not made such expenses so far. Despite Koshy\u2019s confidence, there have been discussions about the platform\u2019s slow progress. Naiyya Saggi, founder of Baby Chara and co-founder of Good Glamm Group, said, \u201cAll network ecosystems take time to build. ONDC is in its infancy today. It\u2019s only been 3 years. Network effect platforms, across the world, take time to build. It doesn\u2019t just happen instantly. They have a flywheel that kicks in as a compounding effect. So, to say today that it\u2019s not working is too premature.\u201d \u201cONDC is going to be slow to take off but my prediction would be that once they onboard use-cases that showcase the value of a network like ONDC, the platform will take off. Retail was expected to be used in this manner, but it\u2019s very complex in terms of the value it offers,\u201d said Johar, adding that the platform has only showcased connecting suppliers and consumers till now. Noting the boost small businesses have received since the UK-India Free Trade Agreement, Johar said such developments could be a turning point for ONDC as well since small businesses will need access to markets, which ONDC specialises in."

Quick-commerce is in a phase of rapid expansion and heightened competitive intensity, for which we have ramped-up investments aimed at market expansion, reach and differentiation. Our Out of Home Consumption business turned profitable in Q4, within just 2 years of its integration. Overall, we remain focused on growth, on the back of delivering unparalleled convenience to consumers.\u201d \u201cSince a significant chunk of new stores and users were added over the latter half of the Q3FY24, their order contribution in Q4 was muted.

However, the West Bengal government challenged this decision in the Supreme Court, filing an appeal in November 2022. Since then, the case has experienced multiple hearings and adjournments, often due to scheduling conflicts and bench reassignments. The case was initially being heard by a bench led by Justice Hrishikesh Roy, but it had to be reassigned after his retirement. On Wednesday, it was to be heard by the division bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and Manoj Misra following a recent reassignment from the bench led by Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol, and Sandeep Mehta on May 11. On Wednesday, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, the state government counsel was busy in the hearing of another case. He reportedly sought a postponement in the hearing which the Supreme Court granted. The next hearing is likely to take place on Friday. Senior advocate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, who is appearing on behalf of a section of state government employees along with advocate Firdous Shamim, informed the media that the court has conveyed there won\u2019t be further delay and the final hearing could take place on Friday. The last hearing in the matter took place on December 1, 2024. The Supreme Court had stated that a detailed hearing was necessary to address the issue of DA for state employees, assuring that all parties would be heard thoroughly. However, due to lack of time, a full hearing could not be conducted."

By his side were his 84-year-old mother, Kamaltai, along with his wife, daughter, and son, their beaming smiles reflecting a journey marked by resilience, love, and an inspiring rise from the slums of Amravati to the highest echelons of the Indian judiciary. As the first Buddhist and second dalit Chief Justice after Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, Gavai\u2019s rise is a testament to grit and the transformative power of B.R. Ambedkar\u2019s legacy. Born on November 24, 1960, in Amravati, Maharashtra, Gavai grew up in a modest home steeped in social activism. His father, Ramkrishna known as Dadasaheb Gavai, a prominent Ambedkarite and former governor, inspired his commitment to equality. His mother, Kamaltai, a schoolteacher, instilled discipline and empathy, ensuring young Bhushan helped with chores despite their humble circumstances. Justice Gavai studied in a municipal school, sitting on the floor in classrooms without benches. He earned commerce and law degrees from Amravati University. Joining the Bar in 1985, he honed his skills under Raja S. Bhonsale, a former advocate general, before practising independently at the Bombay High Court. Elevated to the Bombay High Court in 2003, Gavai served across its benches, earning respect for his fairness. In 2019, he joined the Supreme Court, where he authored landmark rulings on demonetisation, Article 370, and electoral bonds. On his first day as the Chief Justice of India, Gavai paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi and Ambedkar\u2019s statues at the Supreme Court, a nod to their ideals of unity and equality. Gavai also plans to convene a meeting of all judges to outline his vision, discuss the way forward, and invite suggestions. With just about 10 days remaining before the court\u2019s annual summer recess, the court will still function partially, with at least three Benches continuing to hear cases during the break."

In Saudi Arabia for the first leg of his Middle East tour, Trump suggested that India and Pakistan should \"have a nice dinner together\" to help ease tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours. He also sought credit for brokering peace to avert a \"potential nuclear war\" between India and Pakistan, which he said could have killed millions. \"I think they're actually getting along.

Observers and experts believe that Trump's stance isn't helping, considering that he praised Pakistan along with India, while not confronting how the terror attack at Pahalgam had triggered the conflict. \"When Mr. Trump comes in and says, you know, \u2018I spoke to both sides,\u2019 he\u2019s kind of equating,\" said Nirupama Menon Rao, a former Indian ambassador to Washington, told The New York Post. She added that Trump's approach has only made the matter complex for India, which wants to be \"viewed independently and not through the lens of conflict with Pakistan\". \"India and Pakistan are being hyphenated once again,\" Rao said. \"India had genuinely felt that we had broken free of that hyphenation and that Pakistan had kind of receded into the shadows as far as the U.S. was concerned,\" she added. While Pakistan had lavished praise on Trump for his intervention, many in India, including those close to the Centre, had not approved of the ceasefire. Analysts feel Trump did not bash Pakistan enough for its role. \"The last few days have been hard on India. India\u2019s battles against Pakistan-sponsored terror have been invariably lonely ones,\u201d Indrani Bagchi, a New Delhi-based foreign policy analyst, said on X. \"The U.S. and China may be strategic rivals everywhere. But they come together in Pakistan. That reality has not changed,\" she added. Michael Kugelman, a foreign policy analyst, told the BBC that India has interpreted the ceasefire differently from the US and Pakistan. \"Also, since it was put together so hastily, the accord may lack the proper guarantees and assurances one would need at such a tense moment,\" Kugelman added."

Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna rarely courted attention through speeches or public statements as he kept a deliberate distance from the spotlight. His focus remained firmly on the courtroom, where his judgments did the talking. His father, Justice Dev Raj Khanna, a respected judge of the Delhi High Court, and his uncle, the legendary Justice Hans Raj Khanna, a Supreme Court judge, famed for his dissent in the 1976 Habeas Corpus case, shaped young Sanjiv\u2019s world. Law wasn\u2019t just a profession in the Khanna household, it was a calling, a pursuit of justice that pulsed through their conversations and values. Justice Sanjiv Khanna with his father Justice D.R. Khanna and Brother Mahin Khanna Justice Khanna\u2019s early years were marked by discipline and curiosity. At Modern School, Barakhamba Road, he honed his intellect, graduating in 1977 before earning a Bachelor of Arts from St. Stephen\u2019s College in 1980. Then, he enrolled at the Campus Law Centre, University of Delhi. Khanna\u2019s legal career began humbly in the crowded corridors of Tis Hazari\u2019s district courts, where he tackled diverse cases, from civil disputes to criminal matters. His sharp mind and meticulous approach soon led him to the Delhi High Court, where he specialised in constitutional law, taxation, arbitration, and environmental law. As a Supreme Court judge, he authored 173 judgments, tackling issues from electoral bonds to Article 370\u2019s abrogation. His 2024 ruling rejecting 100 per cent VVPAT verification underscored his trust in institutional safeguards, while his grant of interim bail to Arvind Kejriwal emphasised liberty over prolonged detention. He was on the five-judge bench that declared the Electoral Bond Scheme unconstitutional, reaffirming voters' right to information. Justice Khanna prioritised accessible justice, streamlined criminal case management, and tackled pendency with strategic case allocation. His vision for comprehensible judgments and mediation aimed to demystify the law for ordinary citizens. As Chief Justice, Khanna faced monumental cases, from the Places of Worship Act to the Bihar caste census. Amid the controversy surrounding the proposed transfer of Justice Yashwant Varma, following the discovery of unaccounted cash at his residence, CJI Sanjiv Khanna made a decisive move by making the relevant Collegium details public. It was a clear message as and when questions of public trust arise, transparency will have to rule. Justice Sanjiv Khanna played a crucial role in shaping the judiciary\u2019s future through key Collegium decisions during his tenure. Under his leadership, 51 out of 103 proposed candidates were recommended for appointment as High Court judges. The selections reflected a conscious effort toward inclusivity comprising 11 from the OBC community, one from the Scheduled Castes, two from the Scheduled Tribes, eight from minority communities, and two individuals related to sitting or retired judges. Twelve recommendations are still awaiting the government's approval. Notably, three judges were also elevated to the Supreme Court during his time as Chief Justice. A landmark moment of CJI Khanna\u2019s tenure came with the full court resolution passed on April 1, 2025, making it mandatory for all judges to declare their assets upon assuming office, a significant shift from the previous voluntary practice. Just days later, by April 5, 2025, the asset declarations were made publicly available on the Supreme Court\u2019s official website, marking a strong push for greater transparency within the judiciary. On the day of his retirement, Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna made a quiet yet powerful statement that he would not be accepting any post-retirement position. Speaking from the ceremonial bench, he said, \u201cPublic trust isn\u2019t something you can demand. It has to be earned and the Supreme Court has done that.\u201d Visibly moved, he added, \u201cI am speechless. I carry with me a lifetime of memories. Once you are a lawyer, you remain a lawyer. The judiciary is not just the Bench, it\u2019s the Bar too. The Bar is the conscience keeper.\u201d"

He will only speak in Mann ki Baat, the monologues and give speeches from the Red Fort. The Congress party had extended full support to Operation Sindoor. Then, what happened?

The verdict was delivered by the Sixth Additional Sessions Court in Thiruvananthapuram, which had found him guilty on May 12.

            "text": "The Mahila Court in Coimbatore imposes a fine of Rs 85 lakh on the accused. The amount will be paid to the eight survivors of sexual assault Accused in the Pollachi sexual assault case being produced in a court in Coimbatore | PTI The Mahila Court in Coimbatore, on Tuesday, found all the nine accused in the sensational Pollachi sexual assault case guilty and sentenced them to life imprisonment. The case involved sexual harassment of young girls by politically influential men in 2019. Judge R. Nandhini Devi pronounced the quantum of sentence at the special court set up for trial, after hearing the arguments put forth by the prosecution and the defence. The court also ordered a compensation of Rs 85 lakh to the eight survivors of the sexual assault. The nine accused in the case are: N. Sabarirajan aka Rishwanth (32), K. Thirunavukkarasu (34), M. Sathish (33), T. Vasanthakumar (30), R. Mani aka Manivannan (32), P. Babu (33), T. Haronimus Paul (32), K. Arulanantham (39), M. Arunkumar (33) of Panikkampatti. The accused have been charged under sections 376 D and 376(2)(n) of the Indian Penal Code. Section 376 D is a non-bailable section which attracts rigorous imprisonment for gang rape. Under this section, life imprisonment is for a term which shall not be less than 20 years and can extend to the person\u2019s natural life apart from the fine which is paid to the victim. Section 376 (2)(n) attracts maximum punishment for repeated rape of the same woman. \u201cThe prosecution prayed for maximum punishment for the accused, considering the gravity of the charges against them,\u201d CBI\u2019s public prosecutor Surendra Mohan informed the media after the judgment was pronounced. Mohan said all the nine convicts will now have to undergo life imprisonment for the remaining period of their lives for offences committed under section 376 D. What is the Pollachi sexual assault case all about? A horrifying video, in which a girl is heard pleading \u201cAnna vitturunga anna.\u201d (Brother please let me go), went viral on social media in 2019. The blurred visuals of abuse, which showed a girl being beaten by some men, shook the state. As Pollachi police began the probe, details of systematic sexual abuse and blackmailing of several young girls by perpetrators with political backing emerged. The chilling incident came to light when a college girl lodged a police complaint on February 24, 2019, with the Pollachi East police, alleging sexual abuse by four men in a moving car near Pollachi. The 19-year-old survivor was the first complainant in the case. She was allegedly lured and sexually assaulted by the nine men since 2016. In her complaint, she said the perpetrators filmed the abuse. The video was later used to exploit her sexually and monetarily. It all began when the girl was picked up by her boyfriend Sabarirajan in a car on Dharapuram road in Pollachi. On the way, the two were joined by his friend Thirunavukkarasu. While Thirunavukkarasu was driving the car, Sabarirajan sat in the back with the girl. Later, Sathish and Vasanthkumar also joined them. The four men then forcefully assaulted her and recorded a video. They also snatched the gold chain she was wearing. The video was used to exploit her sexually and monetarily for the next few years. Later, the girl informed her brother who went and attacked one of the accused. The girl then filed a police complaint. Upon investigation, the mobile phones and the laptops of the nine men showed that they had blackmailed several young girls and harassed them. While there were videos of more than 150 young girls in the devices seized from the nine men, the CBI identified 12 women and convinced them to come forward and testify against the accused. However, only eight of them deposed before the court including the girl who filed the complaint. The case took a political turn as one of the accused belonged to the ruling AIADMK. Arulalnadham was the AIADMK Pollachi town students\u2019 wing secretary. He was expelled by the party after the news came out. Meanwhile, another person, identified as Bar Nagaraj, who was the local secretary of the Amma Peravai of the AIADMK got involved in the case when he attacked the brother of the survivor who filed the complaint. Although the case was initially transferred to the Crime Branch CID, it was handed over to the CBI when it took a political turn. The CBI ensured that none of the victims were identified in the case. The CBI and the Mahila court recorded all the statements in a closed room. All the eight women testified against the nine men. Though there was a glitch in the investigation when Coimbatore Superintendent of Police R. Pandiarajan revealed the name of the complainant during a press conference, the CBI took it forward with much confidentiality, doing everything possible to protect the identity of the survivors. Following the directives of the Madras High Court, a special courtroom facility was set up at the Combined Court Complex in Coimbatore for the trial to ensure that the identities of the survivors were protected. A special chamber was set up at the court with a one-way glass to prevent others from seeing the survivors during the hearing and the trial of the case, which began on February 14, 2023. A total of 40 witnesses were examined and three chargesheets were filed by the CBI, apart from other incriminating documents including the video and audio footage recovered from the devices of the nine men."

The first commercial flight to land at the airport was an Air India service from Delhi on Tuesday morning, marking the formal restart of civilian air traffic. The temporary suspension of services had been imposed at 32 airports, including Srinagar, after the launch of Operation Sindoor by India targeting terror camps in Pakistan. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) had issued a series of Notices to Airmen (NOTAMS) last week to halt flights at key airports across northern and western India amid the military standoff. On Monday, officials announced that the aerodrome closure NOTAM for Srinagar had been revoked, allowing the airport to resume flight operations. The suspension had also disrupted Hajj operations from Srinagar, delaying outbound flights for pilgrims. However, with services now resuming, airlines are gradually restarting their scheduled flights. SpiceJet on Tuesday announced that it would resume its Hajj 2025 operations from Srinagar on May 14, operating two wide-body Airbus A340 flights to Medina, each capable of carrying 324 passengers. The airline said it would facilitate the travel of around 15,500 Hajj pilgrims this year, with 45 flights scheduled in the first phase connecting Srinagar, Gaya, Guwahati, and Kolkata to Medina and Jeddah. The reopening of Srinagar airport is a crucial development for the Kashmir Valley, where air travel remains a key link to the rest of the country. Located approximately 10 kilometres from Lal Chowk, the city\u2019s commercial centre, the airport also plays a vital role in boosting tourism, a major component of the region\u2019s economy. While flight operations have resumed, services will scale up gradually based on airline approvals and ongoing security assessments."

The military engagement may be over, but the core message of Operation Sindoor\u2014that India will not tolerate terrorism\u2014 as articulated by Modi will now be carried to the people by the BJP. The BJP will organise nationwide tiranga yatras to drum up nationalistic fervour after the ceasefire with Pakistan. In the states where BJP is in power, tiranga yatras will be carried out at the state level with the participation of the army men.

However, after the announcement of the ceasefire and that too by US President Donald Trump, the opposition parties are raising questions over the involvement of a third party. They have demanded a special session of the Parliament to discuss the situation. The BJP is pushing ahead with a massive outreach programme for the next 10 days to hardsell the victories of the war. As Modi had said India has only paused its counteroffensive and would keep Pakistan under strict watch in days to come, the government and the party would like to keep the people constantly informed and updated. The issue of Indus Water Treaty, where India has held it in abeyance and stopped water flow to the neighbouring country, may again pose a challenge in the coming days. PM Modi is expected to travel to Bihar later this month for a progamme where he is also expected to address a rally. It was during a rally in Bihar, two days after the Pahalgam attack on April 22, that he had vowed action against Pakistan. When he returns to Bihar, which goes to polls in October-November, Modi may tell the people that he has delivered on his promise."

Scores of tenant farmers from across the state gathered in Hyderabad to urge the Congress government to fulfil its promises and extend support to cultivators farming on leased land. The consultation meeting, organised by the Telangana Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Commission, saw farmers narrating their struggles. They also put across their demands that include the implementation of the Licensed Cultivators Act, 2011, before the upcoming Kharif season. \u201cWe have been cultivating on lease for long. My husband died by suicide because he could not bear the burden of debt. We have not received any help or scheme from the government,\u201d said Kuruva Manjula from Vikarabad district. \u201cWhen Bharat Jodo Yatra took place in 2022, I met Rahul Gandhi.

But even after the Congress government came, we have not received any farmers insurance, crop loans or any scheme.\u201d To highlight the issues being faced by the farmers, Rythu Swarajya Vedika (RSV), an NGO, organised a press meet post the consultation. The members of RSV pointed out that the Congress party in its 2023 Warangal Declaration and in the open letter by then TPCC president, Revanth Reddy, promised support to tenant farmers wile they were in opposition. They demanded that the government begin identifying tenant farmers under the 2011 Act and issue them loan eligibility cards (LECs) which would help them access credit and compensation in the past. Ramakanth, a tenant farmer from Adilabad, said that under the earlier implementation of the 2011 Act, they were able to get loans and sell their produce at procurement centres. They rue that now money goes to landowners\u2019 accounts as they are excluded from the entire process. The farmers and the activists demanded three urgent steps. The first being revival and implementation of the 2011 Act, second is provision of crop insurance and loans to those with LEC cards, and finally extension of the Rythu Bharosa scheme to tenant farmers. The farmers allege that the flagship schemes of the government meant for farmers welfare doesn\u2019t cover them. RSV leaders pointed out that 75 per cent of farmer suicides in Telangana are by tenant farmers and the crisis cannot be tackled without recognising them. They also raised concerns about the Rs 500 paddy bonus being given by the government, which is not reaching most of the tenant farmers."

We hired a cab to Jammu which took about 8 hours and from there we took a train to Delhi,\u201d he said. They were immediately accommodated at AP Bhavan. The Telugu students came from multiple institutes like NIT Srinagar, LPU, Sher-e-Kashmir University and Lamrin Tech Skills University in Punjab. AP Bhavan has also set up a 24x7 control room and is working closely with the Centre and border state governments to ensure safe passage for students. AP Bhavan officials said the arrangements will continue until all students reach home safely."

            "text": "The anti-war protesters accused the BJP of contradicting its own central government, which had recently agreed to a ceasefire Police arrested protesters, who organised a mass rally under the banner of Yuddha Unmadona Birodhi Gana Michil, in Kolkata on Monday | Salil Bera An anti-war rally in Kolkata, calling for peace and de-escalation between India and Pakistan, was allegedly disrupted by BJP supporters on Monday. Organised by Left-leaning student groups, intellectuals, and civil society members, the rally was held amid growing military tensions between the two countries. The demonstrators had assembled at Moulali in central Kolkata and planned to march toward Esplanade. However, a group of BJP leaders and supporters, led by party leader Sajal Ghosh, arrived waving the national flag. They accused the protesters of being \"traitors,\" and allegedly hurled black ink at them, intensifying tensions. Ghosh, speaking to the media, claimed, \u201cWe won\u2019t let this march happen. These people love Pakistan and oppose India\u2019s interests.\u201d In response, anti-war protesters accused the BJP of contradicting its own central government, which had recently agreed to a ceasefire. They also accused the BJP and RSS of working on behalf of international arms dealers. \u201cThe BJP and RSS are working for arms sellers who want the war because they have to sell their products. As a result, innocent people on both sides of the border are losing their lives. We want the war to stop immediately,\u201d one of the anti-war protesters said. Protesters condemned war-mongering and the surge in war rhetoric that followed last month\u2019s deadly attack on Hindu tourists in Kashmir. They argued that such discourse not only risks prolonged conflict but also deepens communal polarisation and undermines social harmony. However, the BJP workers did not buy the argument and accused them of sympathising with terrorists. Ghosh questioned their silence after the attack on Hindu tourists. \u201cBut now, as India responds, they suddenly remember peace over war,\u201d he said, while his partymen allegedly confronted the anti-war activists. The police deployed in the area, meanwhile, acted swiftly and took hold of the law-and-order situation before it could escalate. The police first detained the BJP leaders and workers. Later, due to the rising tension, the anti-war rally participants were also detained."
